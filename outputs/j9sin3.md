## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Well its the season of Halloween here and I was just wondering if anyone had some horror movie or book recommendations where the characters are logical and don't make any stupid decisions. Some of my own to get things started: 

  The Final Girls (2015 horror comedy) The main character's mother has just died and in an effort to remember she goes to watch a classic horror slasher film that is a thin parody of Friday the 13th where her mother was the final girl. After a strange accident, she and her friends find themselves stuck in the movie. A funny deconstruction and logical chain of events follows as they try to survive the movie. 

  Eden Green by  Fiona van Dahl - a rational horror novel where a character finds her friend has been infected by a strange parasite that has infected his body but made him immortal. Eden, the main character, is a self-styled rationalist, and her thought processes are shown  in pain-staking detail. Whereas her friends treat everything as a big adventure or a true chance for ending death, Eden does her best (as an amateur) to apply scientific rationale to the symbiote and monsters. Trying to keep things secret and reacts with horror/disgust when she investigates the symbiotes. There is some body horror but most of the truly scary stuff is how it goes into exhaustive detail on how people's thought processes and consciousness change. 

  The promised neverland - a manga and later anime that is very rational and logical with a intricate strategies and mental battles. The first season/story arc anyway as the rest of the story never comes close to the first arc in my opinion. A orphanage of love where the children are raised and tested constantly to improve their intelligence. All goes well until a small group discover a horrifying truth about their world that I won't spoil as they tell it to you at the end of the first episode and chapter. But now with the horrible truth revealed, the children must figure out a way to escape the orphanage.

    Blindsight is a transhuman hard sci-fi horror novel. Quite spooky, with an existential horror cherry on top.

    It also occurs to me that Among Us is an opportunity to participate in a horror story (Alien, more or less) and see how rationally that goes for you.

  **[17776](https://www.sbnation.com/a/17776-football).** A wonderful meditation on what it means to be human, viewed through some very inhuman eyes and circumstances. Told in a very quirky, fun, multimedia manner. It's transhuman, but not rational (and sort of a celebration of human irrationality). Ostensibly about American football, but you only need the vaguest sense of what that sport is^* to get it. If this is enough of a rec for you I'd dive in without knowing anything else, but if not then I'd like to also know that it's the story of >!three now-sentient space probes joking around and watching how humans spend their time after they suddenly and unexpectedly all became immortal!<.

  **[20020](https://www.sbnation.com/secret-base/21410129/20020/chapters-index)**. The sequel to **17776**. This is a nice return to the universe. I don't think it's as good as the original (so far?) but it does feature an absolutely brilliant disaster of a modified ruleset for college football.

  **[Frieren](https://mangadex.org/title/48045/sousou-no-frieren)**. Sweet, moderately poignant, meditative look at the life of the prototypical fantasy party's elf wizard after the big quest is over and her impossibly long life drags on. I really liked this at the start, but it's showing worrying signs of turning into a shounen battle manga.

  **Consider Phlebas**. I'm finally getting around to reading the Culture novels. So far disappointed with how little of the Culture itself we see, and kind of surprised how much of this is a space adventure blasty action thing (but I'm not done reading yet). Although I don't care for them, I can recognize that the action scenes are very well put together and fans of those would probably like this, so I thought I'd mention that part of a rec even though I'm not finished.

  --- 

  ^* The sport where two teams try to get the same ball to opposite ends of a field is, in its purest form, awful. Instead of choosing a sensible way to fix it like having to constantly bounce the ball on the ground or never touch it with your hands, American Football tries to fix it by attaching layer upon layer of ritualistic rules to preserve the "everyone violently smashing into each other" character.

      I did a quick check before diving in and saw that it was considered one of the less Culture-y Culture books like you said, but also often considered one of the better ones. I planned on reading at least two, and the second in order is Player Of Games (often considered the best), so I figured I might as well read them in order.

      The sequel's not finished, and I can't find an RSS feed for it. I have it bookmarked, and will probably rediscover it in a few months and finish it then, but if you're the kind of person who prefers to wait for things to be finished before starting them you'll probably want to hold off.

      I am very much enjoying it, though.

  Pretty much all jumpchain stories are just pure wish-fulfillment with minimal thought to plot. However, there are two stories that I have found to have taken the jumpchain concept and built a compelling narrative out of it. Which just proves the old writing proverb correct, "Good writers follow the rules to writing, great writers break them."

  [Companion Chronicles \[Jumpchain/Multicross SI\]](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/companion-chronicles-jumpchain-multicross-si-currently-visiting-breath-of-fire-iii.787978/) \- Instead of the story being from the perspective of a Gary-Sue protagonist, it's from the perspective of a companion who was brought into a Jumper's adventure basically on a whim and all of the realistic issues with come with gaining incredible power, finding out your world is a work of fiction, impossible situations, and being uncomfortably dependent on a near-stranger(s) for it. Reminiscent of Worth the Candle at times when it comes to meditating on the meta-narrative of various fictional worlds.

  [Just An Average Voice In Your Head (A Jumpchain/Original Quest)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/just-an-average-voice-in-your-head-a-jumpchain-original-quest.817823/) \- Just like the above story, the protagonist isn't the Jumper, but rather the poor, semi-insane girl who has to deal with being possessed by an ancient, eldritch Jumper. She...uh...grows up to be a very cheery person with disturbing beliefs and desires (nothing explicit in story, but she's like a friendly Bonesaw, so make of that what you will), set in a normal world, but then gets isekaied into a fantasy world. Predictably, the generic summoned to fight a Demon Lord goes immediately off tracks even before she is properly summoned with her high-school classmates.

  [Sleeping with the Girls](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8839309/chapters/20268301) \- Not a jumpchain story at all, but the protagonist is stuck hopping through worlds where every time he falls asleep, he wakes up in a new fictional world next to his favorite female characters in anime. He is going to be one abused, sleep-deprived boy at the end of all of this nonsense. Recommended for how everyone reacts like real-life, fleshed out individuals while still retaining their personalities from their originating shows.

  While I dislike jumpchains in general, I would love to read more stories that play around with the concept like the ones I recommended.

    Seconding Companion Chronicles; the latest arc is a bit weak, but the rest of it is great and the BoF segment looks to be wrapping up.

    I'll also add [Nowhere Land](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/nowhere-land-jumpchain-multicross-horror.831104/) onto the list of good jumchain fics.

    I think in specific the Jumpchain RAW is too nice for a real story because there aren't any challenges you don't pick out for yourself and you always have more than enough tools to deal with them; at minimum, you need something like Companion Chronicles "can't keep all powers+Powers weakened outside of theme+can't pick jumps+nonfriendly management" in order for there to be a semblance of actual tension.

    [As A Consequence Of Your Action](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/as-a-consequence-of-your-action-jumpchain.845425/#post-66809581) wasn't bad, but it got dropped after 2 jumps. It's a look at a jumper that gets no say in where he jumps and gets some mandatory drawbacks. Just don't read the author notes and the thread, it gets messy at times.
    ```

    - u/WarZealot92:
      ```
      I recomended this some months back as well, while it was still being written. Today, while I agree that the story is still worth checking out, I feel like the second jump sadly experienced a marked drop in quality. Its pacing was absolutely terrible, with the first ninety percent mostly nothing happening and then suddenly a hasty finale. You can see the outlines of good ideas, but sadly the execution really wasn't up to par.

      Also yes, don't read the author's notes. He is extremely sensitive and doesn't handle criticism. At all.

  If you are an experienced RPG player, this story looks promising (15 chapters as of this post):

  [Prophecy Approved Companion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion)
  >Qube is an NPC in an AI-driven VR-RPG who avoids her scripted death and blithely continues following the Player, trying to make sense of the normalised nonsense of Fantasy RPGs and accidentally glitching out the world in stranger and stranger ways as she seeks to be the very best Childhood Companion ever.

  >It’s a loving parody of old school RPGs, high fantasy, and every gamer who has ever thought “what happens if I do this...”

  There are plenty of subtle jokes.

  It is not a litrpg, whatever stats there may be are never mentioned and are not relevant to the plot.

  MC is intended as clever and curious, but inexperienced and somewhat lacking free will.

  There's a [Blindsight short film](https://blindsight.space/) out now. 

  It's honestly more like a Blindsight *trailer*, and I was more fascinated by the "making of" portion of the website, but I don't, like, regret the mere five minutes of my life that it took to watch the film, which did have some good bits in it (I guess I was mostly underwhelmed because I never realized, for all the years I was following its development, that the film would be this trailer-like).
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I went in with no expectations and I was blown away. A great proof of concept for a full length blindsight movie or series. The most surprising thing is how good the voice acting is, that's the part that most amateur film projects fail at the hardest. The CGI, the art design, sound design, all top notch also.

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        You have to make allowances for a medium's shortcomings when adapting. In a book you can say that the X sounded the exact same as Y and there will be no confusion because the author will tell you who's speaking, unless he wants you confused. You can't do that with video, any deception of the audience has to be obvious, so to speak.

      Interesting, can I add a few more requirements and let me know if any of these fit:

      1. Not really interested in the slow build-up. I don't really understand why people enjoy the hero's journey. It was great the first 10 or so times where I actually learnt something and could relate, but only the end-game-content excites me now. Mostly interested in stories where the protagonist is at the end-game already, or is very close. Most of the recommendations I gave start with characters which have completed 95% of their development from the start and are already super competent from the start. 
      2. Not interested in stories where the MC has contrived unrealistic challenges. E.g. I hate constantly scaling crisis/antagonists. They should be the same from the start, and what changes is just how much influence the MC can have, like IRL. 
      3. Don't enjoy stories where the MC barely scrapes by (usually) due to luck. This is what I mean by competence porn, the MC is pretty much never stressed because they have an answer (or can come up with one, or are prepared) for whatever they undertake. 

      Any of those fit these criteria?

      KJ Parker is underappreciated. 

      My favourite work of theirs is The Fencer's first book, where all trials are settled via proxy duels to the death. Cue one grizzled swords-barrister, just a week from retirement, being pressed into service as in charge of defending the city from barbarian siege.

      It's probably the closest of their stuff to bog standard fantasy, but personally I appreciate narrative convention in most of my fiction.

    Here's some recs, none of whom are worm crossovers. I'm only familiar with Transdim, AYWPR, and BAHHCSCQ of those listed, so my recommendations here are mostly based off knowing you like those + your description.

    The vorkosigan saga is great. I general, I recommend reading it in chronological order, which starts at "Falling Free." However, while the first books are good, the main reason I would label this series as fitting this request is Miles Vorkosigan. As such, you might instead want to start at "The Warrior's Apprentice." This is also a pretty organic starting point for the series.

    [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/dungeon-keeper-ami-sailor-moon-dungeon-keeper-story-only-thread.30066/) Is an amazing version of this. Very surprised you haven't already been recommended it. Requires little knowledge of canon settings but might benefit from it for some jokes if you have it. I read it completely blind and was fine.

    [Yashima Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35875/yashima-chronicles) Is a similar style of story to political record, by the same author; if that fits your bill, this probably will too.

    [Santize](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20721824/chapters/49228244) Might also fit here. It's a Warring States! naruto fanfic, but does not require much knowledge of the series. Modern Medical knowledge in a preindustrial society.

    A Certain Scientific Accelerator is an anime that does a good version of this, but I'm not sure how well it stands alone if you aren't familiar of the work it's a spinoff from, and A Certain Magical Index does not really fit this trope. You might be able to get by with substituting the AU fanfic [in memoriam](https://archiveofourown.org/works/864249/chapters/1657513) for the original series, since it is competent protagonist story with excellent writing (it's been recommended here a few times I believe?)  but I was familiar with the series so I can't guarantee it.
    ```

    - u/Dragfie:
      ```
      Unfortunately read them all but In memoriam which I'll try and the book, which maybe if I run dry of web content. 

      A note on DK Ami though; its close but hits a few points I mentioned earlier that I just hate; I'm through it quite a bit, and can't remember any of her plans which actually WORKED. All the engagements end up being won because of some trick she thought up of last-minute and luck that they actually do happen to work, most of which could have been planed/scried for before it came up. Also either because the author isn't good enough to or doesn't for narrative reasons, it's not really rational, there are so many more ways she could be exploiting the setting and so many more things she could plan for which she doesn't. 

      I'd actually de-rec it until your out of all better material.... Just my rant on DKA XD wanted to talk about it I guess.

          Optimized WP just felt to... silly for me. Maybe because its source material is kinda silly, but I just couldn't take it seriously. 

          Kallen I tried, but something just felt off, not sure what exactly, maybe just lower quality, maybe just a bit bland but didn't like it.

    If you're okay with protagonist that take a while to get to a base level of competence, and then progress from there, you could try some published fiction. Cradle book 8 came out recently, and the whole series is about a cast of super competent characters (although they take a while to get to the level of competence).

    Will Wight's House of Blades trilogy also has a really competent protagonist (later on), who works very hard to get to his level of competence.

    The Red Rising series by Pierce Brown has a somewhat angsty but competent protagonist. He of course starts off weak, but his competence is shown pretty early on.

    Kel Kade's King's Dark Tidings series has the world's best assassin learning to be human. He's very competent but emotionally stunted, and the book is about him slowly learning human emotions and morality. It's not *that* serious and is mostly a humorous adventure.

    The Rage of Dragons has a shonen protagonist, kinda. The training montages are awesome and the battles are really satisfying.

    Vlad Taltos is about a human mafia leader and assassin in a world of super elfs, who rises to his position through ruthlessness and competence. Some moments are really funny too.

    Glen Cook's Black Company series follows a somewhat evil mercenary band working for the Big Bad. Almost all characters are adults and competent, but not necessarily good (not even close lol). These are great books, highly recommend. 

    That's all I can think of off the top of my head.

        - u/Dragfie:

          huh, maybe... I assumed at first the definition of Mary Sue was a character who wins everything for no reason: which is definitely not what I am after, but after checking that the definition is "unrealistically lacking in flaws or weaknesses", I would disagree with the unrealistically part, but yes. A competent character would lack flaws and weaknesses in the specific area they are competent in- or figure out/learn ways to mitigate them. 

          So a realistic Mary Sue I guess ;p
          ```

          - u/CaramilkThief:
            ```
            In that case, the only ones that fit your description are Vlad Taltos, Black Company, and King's Dark Tidings. Other than the last one, they all start in media res, so there's no slow build up to power (although there *is* a slow build up to the conflict). 

            In Vlad Taltos, Vlad *does* gain power throughout the series, but it's never something that he's desperately looking for (except for one of his early life books imo). Each book is a different genre, so you get a mixed bag of stuff. Vlad himself is fallible, and he has humane flaws, but he is very competent. You'll have to figure out for yourself if you like that. I'd recommend at least giving the first book a try, since it's pretty short and a fun romp.

            In Black Company, the protagonist is Croaker, a historian and medic of the Company itself. There's not much development of most people's powers, just how they use their current power to solve their problems. The Company itself is very competent, but Croaker's narration of it tends more towards romantic than realistic. However, it's not so much a book about people competently solving problems as it is a meditation on a soldier's life in a mercenary company that's mostly evil.

        I would like to second the Cradle recommendation. I *think* it fits what you're looking for. The characters are as competent as they can be at any given moment and I feel as though the story progresses quickly enough that you'd be satisfied with it.

        The protagonist has a tendency to barely scrape by but it is due to his competence rather than luck. This increases a lot at book 4 or 5 I believe. And the great point about it is that there is an increasing number of competent characters. The latest book has some amazing scenes where the characters are all achieving their goals in fun different ways.

        I really enjoy the strategizing the characters do. In fact, I enjoy Cradle so much that I'd be willing to buy the first 3 books for you.

  The webcomic [Minus](https://alopex.li/mirrors/www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus/minus/www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus.html) is adorifying. A small girl with unlimited superpowers plays games with friends and with reality. [Tvtropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Webcomic/Minus)

    Minus is great, though it lacks a continuity and is more like a series of whimsical vignettes, escalating in surrealness. It's a great display of imagination but it works more like a newspaper comic than a story.

    My favourite work by this artist will always be [Great](https://alopex.li/mirrors/www.kiwisbybeat.com/minus/minus/www.kiwisbybeat.com/great1.html) which is about a guy who, after failing real big and hard decides to become GREAT by sheer force of will. He does this by becoming a ramen cook/neighborhood brawler, and then things get *real weird*. It has that same surrealness escaltion of Minus, but with relatable characters and a more grounded beginning from which to take off into weirdness.

    It's really really good. It follows Pylo a shipmistress and communications expert (Such an expert she is capable of doing things like >!swearing infohazardously!<, >!translating taste-sensations!<, and >!flirting with abstract concepts like The Traditions of a people!<) and her adorable living ship Tunie, who thinks and communicates primarily in velocities and vectors and the like (including puns). Also some humans* I guess. Other excellent examples of the sort of incredibly alien aliens we see include: >!a micro-polity!<, a species that largely fills the ecological niche of >!accountants/clerks!<, >!information-based lifeforms!<, a species that naturally creates >!warheads and their ilk!<, and "trees" that are capable of >!turning into solid rocket boosters in order to proliferate!<.

    Big-picture-wise it's largely concerned with how one deals with unknown unknowns (see: alien aliens, and their comparably alien societies and civilizations), how scale can *really* fuck with you (there's an entire number system designed to be able to express planck-scale values alongside galactic+-scale values), and how those two things interact (the scale itself is what generates some of the alienness we encounter).

  Disclaimer: rational adjacent at best.

  Started reading ['Apocalypse: Generic System'](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35669/apocalypse-generic-system), and while it's still pretty early on, and the title is atrocious (hopefully a working title?), I'm really enjoying it. It's by the author of [Wake of the Ravager](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25878/wake-of-the-ravager), who is excellent at creating munchkinable situations. This story seems to be a more engineering/crafting focused story than WotR, but still has competent writing and a true-to-title generic system and setting.

  Also enjoying [Soulhome](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35660/the-weirkey-chronicles-reborn-across-nine-worlds), by Sarah Lin (of Street Cultivation) and [Shade Touched](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34473/shade-touched)
  ```

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    The munchkining is why Apocalypse: Generic System didn't appeal to me. Real munchkining is about intelligently exploiting a system, but this feels more like the system gets pushed aside every time the protagonist does something smart. 

    Take the pit traps in chapter two. >!In the first chapter we see kruskers are so tough that it could charge into the pointy end of a spear so tough that a grown human jumping on the shaft while it was unsupported didn't budge it, and snap the spear then keep on fighting. When you compare the damage done by the force of the kruskers charge and a toughness and sharpness of a professionally made metal spear to a short fall and wooden stakes. The first krusker in there should shrug off the steaks, then run around in rage knocking the others over. Eventually it will cause the sides of the pit to collapse, it's built in soft soil, then it can climb out. The idea that he practically clears the forest with one-simple-trick isn't plausible!<
    ```

    - u/Kachajal:
      ```
      That's a failing of that author in general, I feel. He's gotten better about it in Apocalypse, but it's pretty clear in Wake of the Ravager that not only is the protagonist the only one really allowed to be clever, it's far easier than it should be for him. 

      This is what made me stop reading Wake of the Ravager, but I'm still enjoying Apocalypse a whole lot, just because those issues are more hidden. Yes, if you actually analyze the situation as you did, then it's pretty implausible. But at a quick readthrough, if you don't overthink it, it's pretty satisfying. Of course, the threshold for overthinking will be different for everyone.

      Also, the particular magic system the protagonist stumbles upon/chooses a bit later on is right up my alley. And it helps that it's something that's almost unique to him specifically, which means that there's genuine low-hanging fruit that it doesn't feel like everyone should already be using.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:
        ```
        What got me to stop reading WoTR wasn't just that the protag were the only one to be clever, it was that he was willing to risk the lives of his friends for a prank and in general be annoyingly smug about stuff he doesn't deserve to be smug about.

    ```

    - u/TacticalTable:
      ```
      Yeah, though I think that title is equally bad. If not for getting linked from the author's other story, I would have discarded the story as a lazy genre parody that seems to be filling the Litrpg category. I think I've seen at least 20 of the RR 'Trending' fictions contain the word 'generic' referring to the system, setting, or protagonist. Meanwhile, Wake of the Ravager has an actual unique title and cover.

    I like the magic systems of both Soulhome and A:GS quite a bit - A:GS has a neat "enchantment" system based on physical mana lenses that act more or less like actual lenses, and Soulhome actually makes me think of some ideas I had in the past for a Terraria-like game - you build your bases in those games, but there's no ludic impact to having a fancy base versus a hovel. Why not make a cultivation game where you build a base with gameplay impact in your soul?
    ```

    - u/TacticalTable:
      ```
      Yeah, they're both fairly unique and flexible magic systems, Soulhome's being very unique, but still largely unexplained. From my experience with the author, A:GS is likely going to have a ton of interesting crafting materials, lenses just being the beginning. Then will just let them interact in broken ways to benefit the main character, and occasionally antagonist characters.

    I'm a big fan of Wake of the Ravager. I really like the way skills work in that and the way the main character munchkins things is great. Also enjoying Apocalypse: Generic System so far, so that's two up recs from me.
    ```

  - u/OnlyEvonix:
    ```
    I read that, sort of rational lite, thought is put into situations but there's rarely any reason for much depth. It also talks about magic circuitry which is nice as it gives a system by which one can cludge together useful things but still have definite room for advantages from deeper understanding and higher complexity.
    Soulhome is so far less rational than Street cultivation, but it's too soon to tell, the main character is emotionally damaged and mostly going off preconceived notions and the world is complex enough that we don't really have enough information to start trying to draw conclusions. I would recommend Street Cultivation first and highly but this is good too.

    Shade Touched is nice and cute. It's thoughtful and I like it.

        But no it's really heartwarming, and I particularly enjoy just how much of an idealized hero Link is - he only gets stressed out when he thinks he's failing someone, otherwise he's more or less okay saving the same people from the same problems over and over again. Like, it's not *ideal*, it's not what he wants to be doing, but he never shirks his responsibility or decides that a particular loop is trash anyway so he might as well fuck off and do something else (except for one part in the beginning where things get kinda dark and he >!basically speedruns the game, and even then his thought process is "I can save everyone else after I've saved Zelda"!<)

        He even spends some time trying to figure out how to save them *better*, in order to make the final loop as good as it can be.

The main characters are three 13 year old girls who are let in on the secret that Magic exists by a group of non-human Others who want their help in solving a murder case. Maybe it's Wildbow deliberately trying to write something different, maybe it's a consequence of the main characters being rather young, but it's a lot more *fun* to read than most things Wildbow has written so far. It's still ongoing, has I think 300-400k words so far, and rather active chapter discussion over on /r/parahumans.

  Also question, have any of you guys read LE Modesitt Jr.'s works? He seems pretty prolific and some people from r/fantasy called his works rational, so I'm wondering how you guys see his works.

    An author that springs to mind is Lois McMaster Bujold. All her books tend to have very tender and genuine emotional connections between characters, but my favourite series of hers is the Vorkosigan Saga, an action-adventure space opera series. For your request I'd recommend  two of her books, the first one of which is a kind of prequel with a different (female) protagonist to the rest, [Cordelia's Honor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61900.Cordelia_s_Honor), and has a strong romantic subplot. The second, [A Civil Campaign](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61899.A_Civil_Campaign), is 10 books in and is, contrary to all its predecessors, pretty much a straight up romantic comedy. It has male protagonists. I read ACC many times since I was a teenager and it's still one of the funniest books I've ever read in my life.

    Also, have you read any of Guy Gavriel Kay's books? They all tend to have a romantic subplot, and they all tend to range from good to great. All his books are set in analogues of historical nations. My favourites of his are, [Sarantine Mosaic duology](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49173-the-sarantine-mosaic), [Tigana](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/104089.Tigana), [Fionavar Tapestry](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49379-the-fionavar-tapestry trilogy). My one quibble is that IMO they all have similar themes and prose which makes them seem repetitive if you read too many, but not a concern unless you binge read his entire bibliography.

    Read some of his books in high school. I'd say they're pretty basic and tropy. Would only recommend a look if you're scraping the barrel for fantasy. Check out Abercrombie, Martin, Butcher, Le Guin, Zelazny, Erikson, and maybe Sanderson and Jordan first if you haven't already. On the other hand, if you're curious, I say go for it—they're not the worst by any means.

    [I wrote a very long take on Modesitt for this subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5g4z4f/rt_l_e_modesitt_jr/)

    TL;DR: I mildly recommend him, but in small doses; his work gets very samey.

      Aren’t their powers not unique though? One of the characters states that it used to be more common for sacred artists below Archlord to manifest the powers of a Sage, Sage badges used to be an additional badge along with denoting their Lord level.

      I’ve seen some discussion on the Cradle sub, and another lore bit mentioned was that paths used to be a lot riskier, but with more opportunity and uniqueness. This is also backed up by how lots of artists follow a set path instead of trailblazing like the MCs, which is much riskier and also more rewarding. This is further backed up in Soulsmith when we see the differences between Lindon’s Iron Body and the Iron Body ritual of a “super talented” child of the Sandviper clan. That child only took 1 drop of venom of a Sandviper, and it was still a worry as to whether it was too much, whereas Lindon took 5 whole Sandvipers worth of venom and was seconds away from death. On present day there’s a lot less risk and reward in advancing, with Paths set in stone, which explains the lack of Underlord and Overlord Sages.

      There’s precedent for lower advancement Lord stages to also become Sages, and with Lindon’s journey and his willpower, I don’t think his Sage advancement was unreasonable or unique.

      You’re right in that Yerin’s power up is unique and unseen on Cradle before, though. I do feel it’s not unreasonable though, there are so many cases of unique power ups on Cradle, like Sophara roided up beyond belief and Yan Shoumei’s Blood Shadow having conceptual strength like that of a Herald while only being at Underlord. Yerin herself has the precedent of the Sage of Red Faith, with the crucial difference of not being an evil, selfish asshole, allowing her to advance without complications and giving her precedence for her advancement.

        Yerin's power up is unique but it was also theorized to be possible by the Sage of Red Faith - that's where he was going with his Blood Shadow technique.

        My issue is more that any foreshadowing for both of those advancements were only done this book. And that the info about the advancements directly contradicts info we got from previous books: even northstrider said that underlords couldn’t achieve an icon last book. 

        If even monarchs can be proven wrong about sacred arts, a lot of things are up in the air about the magic system now. 

        And to me, MCs having unique advancements is more frustrating because it means the MCs are going to win not by being clever or rational, but because they have special unique powers.

          > MCs are going to win not by being clever or rational, but because they have special unique powers

          That's the main conceit of xianxia, and its main failing, imo; the exponential gulf of power between advancement realms means that one should *always* lose when fighting someone a realm above, let alone 2 or more. Fighting against higher cultivation enemies then becomes an easy way for the author to produce narrative tension, but winning then has to be used sparingly, or else it cheapens the foundation of the xianxia genre: power scaling. 

          In Cradle the author has used the "defeating a higher cultivation enemy" trope so much that it feels contrived. Every single book of his features it in one form or another. Another annoying trope he overuses is having the MC power up mid fight against someone of higher cultivation that they were losing against(happens like 3x in Wintersteel!). Also notice how strong artifacts and treasures are when Lindon uses it to scrape by a narrow victory(books 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) against someone of higher cultivation, but how they are either completely absent from all their enemies fighting styles, or ineffectual.

          I don't think anyone said underlords *can't* touch on an icon, they were all saying that it's really hard and will probably be unstable.

          Like, Yerin literally touched on the Icon of the Sword in Uncrowned, so clearly it's possible.

            That was from Northstrider, as he was examining Lindon and Yerin’s match at the end of Uncrowned.

    Gravity Dreams is one of my top ten books of all time.  He's got a couple good standalones, but his longer series end up being repetitive.

  Believe I found a good recommendation: [Apocalypse Man](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34623/apocalypse-man?review=822991#review-822991). I would say rational, but possibly rational-adjacent. 

  Typical litRPG, but three things stood out enough for me to recommend people at least giving it a try. One, the System and how things work is different enough from others that I think it's interesting, and has a LOT of potential for future plot points. Two, grammar and style is great, this is was made an author that has a great handle on words and how they want to portray things. Three, the MC is certainly OP or under-powered - they very realistically are struggling through the world, learning their power, and just doing they best they can. No power creep so far and I don't see it happening anytime soon. Not only that, but they are pretty conspicuous, which is/will drive a lot of plot, which I think is different from the "normal-looking-person-but-but-with-hidden-strong-powers" trope.

  I realize everybody's taste is subjective, but I think if you're just looking for something to check out or follow for potential, this is a good one. Almost 20 chapter so far, a few pretty long ones.

    I have checked it out and want to offer some PSA.

    This should have some trigger warnings for rather graphic torture (in the latest chapter as of writing [19]). Apart from that, I think what is written for now suffers from a rather bad combination: an at the very least mentally stunted MC and very little agency on his part.

    Spoilers ahead:

    >!That he hasn't even tried to experiment with his powers already seemed like a bad sign, but okay, the guy just survived a nuclear bomb so he's probably in shock. But then, he gets out with his new hunter team and in the first outing everyone dies except him. So what does he, a mutant looking being who just arrived in town and just led an entire veteran(ish) team to their deaths, do? Obviously return to the same town and expect that nothing bad will happen to him. I just stopped reading at that point, and from what I skimmed from the next chapter it was just the MC being tortured for his stupidity!<

      I agree that it's certainly not a decision that would've yielded best results, but as far as I could tell, he didn't have any other options.

      Spoiler:

      >!That was the only civilization that he knew about close by, and he doesn't really have any survival skills to speak of. It definitely turned out bad for him, but I think you're vastly underestimated the social aspect to it. Wander around for who knows how long, with who knows what else out there? With, like you said, not a great grasp on his powers. Or, take a reasonable chance and go back to the place with people, information, food, etc. Especially when there was no indication that those events would happen. I will; however, strongly agree he needs to play around with his powers more and have more agency. It's been too long in a world where he needs to get a grasp on these things, and he's just kind of muddling through. He probably would've had an easier time if he did as well. Maybe this will be his motivator for progressing.!<

  Do you know of any fanfics that are like [A Rabbit Clan's Fox](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7555468?view_full_work=true) which I have a hard time trying to explain but like anything close to it in either tone or content would be appreciated.
