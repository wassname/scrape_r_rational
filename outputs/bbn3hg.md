## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Still kind of churning my wheels on my "rampant plant growth" setting that I think I mentioned here a few weeks ago. I've decided on magical energy to facilitate fast and never-ending growth, combined with a wet environment, and facilitated by exposure to sunlight (as otherwise there would be plants that only subsist on the magic and the ecology would become too alien). Kudzu grows a foot a day, so that's the baseline, applied to bushes, trees, vines, and everything else, so quick that it's a legitimate threat to human civilization.

  So, let's talk adaptations.

  Adaptation 1:

  The trees and vines are constantly growing, but rather than continually cutting them back, they can be braided, sculpted, and directed in order to make walls and barriers, effectively allowing the problem to become its own solution. This still takes time and effort, but can be done without much in the way of cutting implements. It represents people twisting nature to their own goals, men who are cultivators of the wilds.

  Adaptation 2:

  There are some places that trees and vines will naturally not grow, like large rock outcroppings, places that have exceptionally poor soil, high altitude, deep underground, sufficiently cold climates, or on the water. All of these represent fairly different civilizations, some of which aren't core to the setting itself (e.g. polar climate doesn't look *that* much different). I do like some of this idea though, that there are people who have built up their own civilizations that are as far away from the plantlife as they can be while still able to have food to eat. It represents a fundamentally skeptical/cautious approach to nature that I think works as a nice counterpoint, men who are not "of the forest".

  Adaptation 3:

  Rather than sculpting or cutting the land, or going where the plants are not, it might be possible to simply go with the plants, allowing them to shape daily life. These people would be something like nomads, moving and situating themselves almost every day, carrying minimal and light shelters and little equipment. The most evocative of these would probably be people living in tree houses that are elevated with the natural growing to be out of reach of major predators and pests, but I can't actually find any historical examples of full civilizations using tree houses, and I'm not sure the peculiarities of the setting can actually justify them. These would be people that don't do much with nature, neither cultivators, battlers, shunners, or anything else. Limited room for advancement though, and presumably low-tech.

    I really love this idea. My first thought when I started reading was "that's the kind of ecosystem that would support some awesomely huge creatures". As in, the size of dinosaurs and up. Especially if the magical energy that promotes life made it's way up the food chain. But even if it didn't, you have enough calories to support massive herbivores living in fairly close proximity. And with massive herbivores comes massive carnivores...

    My second thought was thinking of the logistics of this ecosystem. You have these extremely dynamic plants that are going to be competing with each other for water, sun and soil. How dependent are they on these things, above and beyond the magical energy? Are you going to have a dense jungle of impassible plants, stacked dozens of meters deep, like a borg cube of plants, extending over the horizon? Would the plants die or go back to normal without the magic?

    An interesting way to introduce tension to the setting would be if the magical energy would vary from place to place, so that there would hotspots of plant activity that would shift and threaten cities and nations. There could be massive advantages to being near such a spot(abundant food and resources, maybe even magical resources?), but also big potential threat if the zone expands or shifts, as well as the 'commonplace' natural hazards (eg. huge herbivore migrations, predators hunting outside the zone, plants having to be constantly contained).
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Something that might prevent borg cube nature would be a natural density to magic. Big trees could suck out a bunch of magic in the space around them, leaving voids around them. Stuff can still voraciously grow, but it would be one way to keep the density down.
      ```

  - u/bacontime:
    ```
    Adaptation 4: armies of *giant magical* goats. Nomadic herding cultures which don't really have to be nomadic. 

    Main issues are waste management and keeping the herds healthy. A die off of goats results in your village getting swallowed up by the trees.
    ```

  - u/tjhance:
    ```
    This setting sounds like a lot of fun. (I've always had a thing for really big trees.)

    I think you could also have a lot of fun with the alternate climates, rather than just saying that stuff doesn't grow out there as much. You could have huge underwater algae, for example, or deserts where cacti grow wild. Out in the cold... I don't really know, but you could always make up a fictitious plant that thrives in the snow or something.
    ```

      ```
      I'm not sure how much I'm going to develop it as a setting, but I kind of want to get at least six or seven different biomes down, which will take inspiration from various Earth biomes or plants. It's possible that a sea biome or desert biome might make it into there, but I'm still kind of doing the broad sketches. Oceans, lakes, and seas are a whole different story, with seaweed rafts, floating islands of biomass, and stuff like that, but the setting isn't (yet) *for* anything, so it's kind of hard to say whether or not they'll get an entry in the worldbuilding doc I'm writing. Regardless, there *are* places that are inhospitable to plant life, though given the extra boost that plants are getting, there are far fewer places like that than on Earth.

      (One of the things I definitely do want is a look at something like mangroves, but I don't think that fast growth actually aids in sediment accumulation, which is how mangroves make new land.)

    How about [Devil's gardens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_garden), clearings in the forest produced by ants that some plant species have "domesticated"?

    >The ant Myrmelachista schumanni creates devil's gardens by systematically poisoning all plants in the vicinity except D. hirsuta, the tree in which it nests. The ant poisons the plants by injecting formic acid into the base of the leaf. By killing other plants, the ant promotes the growth and reproduction of D. hirsuta, which has hollow stems that provide nest sites for the ants; a single ant colony might have more than 3 million workers and 15,000 queens, and may persist for more than 800 years.[3] Although the ants fend off herbivores, the size of the garden is restricted by leaf destruction increasing as it expands, as the ants are unable to defend the trees beyond a certain point.[4][5]

    Course you might need to improve the ants a little for your setting. . . .

    If the magic force feeding the plants has some kind of base-level intelligence behind it, this setting sounds a lot like Pandora, from Avatar. You could even have plotlines where fighting the plants too hard results in the plants fighting back, either through overwelming growth or by developing spines, poison, noxious fumes, etc. Tons of ways you could go with a setting like this one.

  Here's a wack idea I've recently thought of. Background reading: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4685590/.

  ---

  Two species (coincidentally) evolve at much the same time to civilization-spawning levels of intelligence. Humans don't exist here. One is a bird derivative, with a small but incredibly dense and fast brain, optimized by evolution for the low weight and fast reflexes needed by avians. The other is cetacean that had a successful runaway mutation that greatly increased brain size, selected for because intelligent behaviours allowed the animals to game their mating ritual and hunt elusive prey better, but did nothing to speed their naturally ponderous brain.

  The result is a contradistinction between what might be termed the clever, and the wise.

  The avians have simpler language than we do, and struggle with the highly abstract ideas we use to construct our maths and our machines, but their intuition and wit is unparalleled, and they use writing and tools to compensate for their weaknesses. Their society moves quickly, flight hastening the spread of innovation and producing a globally semihomogeneous culture, as the planet quickly fills with their cities.

  It's unlikely that such a creature could build an iPhone, but they should be capable of much of our history's less complicated technology. Their ability to fly gives them a different conception of territory and war than we might be used to; governments cannot rule from atop when each member is so freely able to move where it wishes. Citizens cannot be forced into a king's army, walls cannot fortify against immigrants or attackers, ranged weapons are of little use to anyone. Decentralization is the name of the game.

  The cetaceans, blessed by a fluke of biology, have minds that can hold books in their heads, reason through the most complex of arguments without a note, visualize contraptions in motion and whole. They speak slowly, with deliberation—they could not follow the rapid pace of the avians' tongues—but what they do say is packed deeply with meaning, nuance, and entropy. They live in groups, each with its own culture, each enclave knowing its own small subset of the many languages and dialects available across the sea.

  Their environment and physique are hostile to the development of large structures or written records, so their societies remain small. For sure, they discover and industrialize farming, they clear the waters of their predators, they build caverns and safe havens, but for the most part their lives are rural and philosophical. Left much longer, alone, most likely they would evolve back to the norm, living in the remains of a haven they could never hope themselves to build.

  ---

  I'm going to cut my own comments about this short since this is already pretty long, but the question is:

  **What happens when these species meet?**

  What would a story set in this world, overseeing this discovery, look like? They have so much to offer each other, and so much need for the help. Unlike most such early species interaction, these societies barely even compete, and a war would be incredibly difficult.
  ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    I think war would be possible and it'd be a one sided affair dominated by the aviens, provided they have the technology to build prosthetic flight aids (think lift assist via balloons, wing extensions, possibly even booster engines) and depth charges. Depth charges are actually pretty simple, and I'd expect a flying species to have an easier time with the hard parts of flying machines than humans did. With those two technologies they can potentially strike any cephalopod community without the cehpalopods having much recourse. However since the aviens don't have the same concept of war we do, they might not think of it, but I'd expect the cephalopods will. So the aviens will likely be negotiating from a position of strength whether they realize it or not. 

    &#x200B;

    I'd also be curious whether it's an avien submarine, or a cephalopod super-lithos  that is the vehicle for first contact. (ok I juts wanted to use that word) Who makes contact with whom could shape a lot of their initial relations however as it will affect what kind of initial mistakes get made and how widely knowledge of them spreads. The Cehpalopods would have a harder time repairing any insult they give against the aviens than vice versa due to speed and range of communication for example. And in both cases there are bariers to the visiting species immediately recognizing the home species as inteligent (the visitors have machinery capable of supporting them in a hostile environment which is a bit of a give away)
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      Cetacean, not cephalopod; dolphin-like, not squid-like. Cephalopod bodies would be much more interesting, but I didn't find any information about their neuron packing density, their brains are so different they don't fit the paper, and I don't think they have the kind of social structures, play, and methods of communication that some cetaceans are known to have.

      I don't see the avians inventing powered flight; they're below-human skill at that kind of engineering, and it seems redundant for a bird. Eventually, maybe, but probably much later than first contact would be. Similarly, I don't expect they'd have popularized explosives, since primitive ones aren't very useful in air combat, especially if industrialized war isn't common. Flight might even mean they wouldn't invent advanced metalwork, since it's costly to carry heavy things.

      Cetaceans would be a lot easier for first contact; maybe as simple as an adventurous avian setting sail, or a migrating cetacean coming close to a populated shore. The cetaceans would be smart enough to capitalize on the opportunity in full, even if the avians weren't.

  Sometimes I find myself writing long conversations between 2 people that are just paragraphs of alternating dialogue.

  First of all, is this is a bad thing?

  Second of all, how can I spice it up? I can interrupt with the POV's characters thoughts, but sometimes those thoughts are already just the things they say in conversation. I can write the other character's reactions and describe their body language, but I don't think I'm very good at describing body language. (Guess I should get better?)

  I can set the scene somewhere interesting, which helps a bit, but after the introduction, there's not much else to say about it. I can have the characters doing some action and have the dialogue interrupted by descriptions of that action, but this often seems irrelevant to the conversation and adds extra noise. And sometimes, the characters are necessarily just in a boring meeting room anyway. (I actually did start one section with the POV character's feelings on meeting rooms, which worked surprisingly well, I think.)

  Does anybody have any other advice?
  ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    What is such dialogue typically trying to achieve? You don't necessarily need to transcribe the spoken dialogue fully (or at all), depending on your preferences. You already mentioned trying to get better at describing actions during dialogue too.

    In general, I personally don't take issue with long conversations between characters if the conversation is engaging to read; that can, however, be a high bar.

  I feel like this must be done before but how would you expect a litrpg setting to be different than a normal fantasy setting? I'll provide a ruleset here to have a world build by but if you have comments or thoughts that would apply to a different framework feel free to share those too.

  1. People have classes and can only gain experience by killing enemies and by completing dungeons. Experience received depends on both the level of the killer(s) and the relative level difference but not on on the relative danger. People do not gain experience by training or doing classes related stuff unless it's killing or dungeon crawling. 
  2. Experience is split between those who were involved in the kill. The effort involved in killing the monster does not matter but there's a minimum threshold of doing at least one point of damage, one debuff or giving one buff to someone who does one point of damage. If multiple people of different levels participate in the kill, the lowest level members gains the least experience. This difference increases as the level gap increases such that when there is a large level gap the lowest level member gains basicly nothing.
  3. It takes roughly 30 solokills of equal level to achieve next level. The power of classes scales superlinearly with class level.  
  4. Optional: Assume that ability scores and skills can be trained independently of class level but that it takes X weeks to raise a stat/skill from X-1 to X, i.e. it takes 3 weeks to raise a skill from lvl 2 to lvl 3.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Assuming that permadeath applies, the biggest factor is probably risk minimization. That is to say, people will be optimizing for the fastest **safe** way to level. This probably means doing things as a slow, boring grind with one overleveled party member doing the brunt of the work while low level hangers on sit back and apply ineffective buffs, ineffective debuffs, etc. Fights are also probably as lopsided as possible, with as many cheesy strategies as possible, e.g. monster farms where kills can be accomplished with zero risk whatsoever, heavily fortified chokepoints constructed by extremely high level characters who won't be counted as killers, borrowed/rented equipment that trivializes things, etc. If not all level N monsters are created equal, only the weakest or most easily trivialized monsters of level N will ever be fought.

    (What you *don't* get, unless there's a ton of work put into it, is people actually fighting for their lives in a dungeon.)

    On a social level, you probably have a world that's dominated by a few people with a really high level, unless there's a level cap or level scaling is skewed such that reaching level N is effectively impossible for anyone (which doesn't appear to be the case per the rules). Depending on the specifics of leveling and the powers of the classes, you would expect either authoritarian rulers who each have dominion over some area and authoritarian underlings to manage smaller territorial units, or a grand unified empire controlled by the powerful with controls in place to prevent/screen people from ascending to their level.

    Some classes are likely to be better than others for mundane use, and those are likely to be the most popular ones, but it depends on the specifics of which class can do what, how long buffs last, etc., all of which would need some definition (and probably iterative development, if you wanted to make a non-degenerate setting, or an interesting degenerate one).
    ```

    - u/Veedrac:
      ```
      If the cheese is good (and it probably will be), you might not find so skew a distribution of levels. Early levels will be easy because infrastructure can cope with low level monsters, so people will be killing well above their skill level and powering through the rankings.

      The trope is normally that higher level monsters are less rote, more prone to unexpected variability, and much harder to contain, which combined with the sparsity of even-higher-level people means a lot more effort is needed to tackle those areas safely.

      This only happens when there's moderate superlinearity, eg. n^k rather than k^(n), since exponentials have a tendency to explode. If the industrial course gets you to level 100 (from, say, ~1k kills) in a standard education, high level ‘hero’ types might only get to 300 in their lifetime from a full ~10k solokills, each requiring significant planning to do safely, and probably more since solokills are unsafe. x^3 scaling would only make such people a factor 30 stronger than than the standard individual, for significantly more than 30x the investment.

      The most value these elites would have would then probably just be power-levelling a bunch of people to level 200, and the cycle repeats again until the average person ends up leaving the system not because it's not able to power level them up, but simply that the reward isn't worth the time investment. The highest level characters are mostly determined by how long they've been grinding the ladder, and which of them are rich enough not to need to spend their time supervising people climbing the ladder below them.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:
        ```
        You know, I really wonder whether such a world wouldn't have devolved into a total destruction of life. If there's evolutionary pressure to kill more things then most things will end up killing more things than they need. Structured humans in particular would be seeking out easier ways of killing.

        For reference the meat industry puts a lot of strain to our environment despite the average meat eater only eats 70 big animals(pigs and bigger) during their entire lifetime. You have to go really nuts if you need 10k kills of equal lvl.

          I'd assumed evolution isn't a thing, and the dungeons have an MMORPG's ability to replenish their inhabitants boundlessly. Evolution doesn't seem sensible, hence the former, and without the latter the story would be about the economics of limited resources, not dungeoneering.
          ```

          - u/GeneralExtension:
            ```
            >the dungeons have an MMORPG's ability to replenish their inhabitants boundlessly.

            This does leave the question of how they're replenished, though. (Also, if people/humans aren't spawning they might evolve.) Do they come back (resurrection) or is it like cloning? (Can monsters have children?) Evolution doesn't strictly require sex, something like cloning would work as well. (With the caveats that 1) exact cloning might miss out on mutation, and 2) if you have the genetic materials, then you could bring back whatever you wanted, allowing for artificial selection, or just creating the same group over and over again. (Which could vary if your copying process wasn't perfect, and especially if you threw away the old stuff.))

            Resurrection takes things in a different direction - what if monsters learn?
            ```

            - u/Veedrac:
              ```
              I don't think you can assume genetics and evolution because the level system makes no sense as an evolutionary target, nor is there an obvious ‘natural’ magic that would seem to allow levelling to evolve sanely. It's easiest just to throw that whole framework away.

              As to how monsters get replenished, I'd have just said they were spawned by ambient dungeon magic, because that's how games work.

              > Resurrection takes things in a different direction - what if monsters learn?

              Things get fucky if farmed monsters are human-tier smart even without respawns, and if they're not that smart it doesn't matter if they learn because they aren't smart enough to do anything about it.

                >the level system makes no sense as an evolutionary target, 

                It (genetics) affects, say, your starting base stats. (Provided that humans are still the result of sex, and not spawning, or being brought from another world. Selection still tells you a bit about old people (unless it's hell, with an ever increasing deluge of immigrants.) - "There are old pilots. There are bold pilots. But there are no old, bold pilots." This goes up if there's immortality.)

                >just said they were spawned

                Spawned how? When the dungeon is cleared, then after one hour, x number of (brand new) goblins will reappear in the same/random places, y slimes, etc.?

                >if they're not that smart it doesn't matter if they learn because they aren't smart enough to do anything about it.

                Imagine Groundhog Day. They don't have to be *very* smart. But they're learning from death. If they don't get it the first time, or the second, they will still be there the hundredth time. Knowing how to make fire isn't necessary to learn that sticking your hand into it hurts.

                  No, I mean mechanistically. A level system doesn't evolve naturally.

                  > Spawned how?

                  Anyhow. Whatever works.

                  Knowing fire hurts doesn't stop the humans setting you on fire, is my point. Your agency only matters if you have an option that changes things.

    Depending on how long buffs last, you might have career adventurers auctioning off the right to cast buffs on them before they leave town and go adventuring, to get a share of the XP. That could even evolve into a form of prediction market that predicts how successful their quest will be.

    Since the XP doesn't depend on the danger, I'd expect to see adventurers seek out as many options to trivialise encounters as possible. For example, standard practice might include smoking out or flooding dungeons and to never engage melee-only enemies up close if at all possible. Perhaps this would lead to more specialisation in terms of roles, for example archers who refuses to take jobs where the enemies can used ranged attacks or fly, or tanks who only fight enemies who they're certain can't get through their defences. With that in mind, the most important role might shift towards scouting out the enemy, to ensure that the appropriate specialists are sent to the right locations.

    2. A toddler being allowed to get the last hit on a bound monster, being told to invest in intelligence, and now having adult-like intelligence. Thus allowing said toddler to start the level grind way before their peers.
    3. Psychotic serial killers being very high level and protective personal(guards/police) finding solutions to handle such high level individuals without relying on adventurers, either with ethical or less ethical means. Possibly being rewarded with the honor of killing a caught criminal for the XP.
    4. Ways of getting XP being sold on the market.

  Imagine a world where Everyone has the same sense of humour.

  Like, it's not that people *Generally* find the same kind of thing funny, or usually agree whether a joke is good or bad. It's not some kind of cultural enforcement or mind control.

   No, for completely natural reasons, Literally *Everyone* has the same sense of humour, with visible deviations constituting maybe, say, a quarter of a percent of the population. Genetics, Nurture, and- as long as they understand the underlying context even vaguely- culture? They play no role. Thinking of a funny joke is like winning the lottery. And it makes you famous. Comedians are simultaneously revered for their universal appeal, and the hardest job in the world to succeed in. Oh, it used to be that you could be a good- on a local level- comedian just by being able to execute already well-known jokes which involve physical difficulties, but the rise of video put an end to that. Now being a Comedian requires a highly gifted mind and fast iteration time- or a large joke-research company backing you. It is whispered in dark corners of the world that the governments have all searched for their best jokes, and have them at the ready to distract enemy soldiers in wars. 

  Political parties still exist, for all an insult to either side amuses all members of the world. Advanced teams search for political jokes, which support their ideology. This is the best form of propaganda. Find a joke with inherent political implications, and fame and money are not your limit. you could lead a company- decide policy on the world scale, by releasing or refusing to do so.

  [Vague story idea stub thing. is it good? bad? interesting? It probably wouldn't be easy to write a story about it- to be unique the jokes have to be centre stage, but I'm not sure what one would write about in such a case. But i thought it was an interesting idea, at least.]

  **Relativity**

  Anyone up on their equations for relativistic acceleration?

  Assuming that you have a craft of a constant 10,000 tons, and an engine that exerts a constant force of around 890 meganewtons (ie, a felt acceleration of 10 gravities), which equations do I use to find out how much objective time it takes to accelerate up to .9c, or .99c, or the like? (I'm pretty sure that it's more than just multiplying the subjective duration by the final speed's Lorentz factor, but I'm having trouble finding an intro to special relativity that doesn't shove the whole four-dimensional mess of calculus and matrices at the reader all at once.)


  Edit: Nevermind, found what I need at http://www.desy.de/user/projects/Physics/Relativity/SR/rocket.html
