  I've been reading a lot of webserials recently. I have a bit of aversion to picking up published works lately... I often have the sense that many published fiction works have lost their spark in the editing process. On the other hand, webserials writing quality varies vastly and I find myself leaving harsh reviews about 50% of the time. I abandon a lot of what I read, probably at least 20% of what I start is abandoned for one reason or another.

  **Recommendations**:

  [The Good Student](https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10286) - Original webserial fiction. Follows one of four students who is able to attend a prestigious academy on a merit scholarship. Pretty much everything about this story is impressive, the writing quality is high, worldbuilding is just right, and the characters all feel real and multidimensional.  I am seriously impressed. It only has ten chapters so far, but the content so far is fantastic.

  I've read some of mooderino's other works, like How To Avoid Death On A Daily Basis, but I dropped that into Book 5. The Good Student is a significant improvement.

  [The Wandering Inn](https://royalroadl.com/fiction/10073) - Follows a girl from Earth mysteriously dropped into a fantasy world with no special abilities. Barely survives and gains a job as an innkeeper in a burned out village. It's quite good, albeit a bit slower paced.

    Damn you all for this Good Student recommendation! I went to check it out given the 4 or 5 users praising it in this thread, and somehow managed immediately to forget that it was a work-in-progress until suddenly the 'next chapter' button stopped working. Anyhow, this is another +1.
    ```

    - u/Determinor:
      ```
      Atleast it updates weekly; some other works in progress (like, say, mother of learning) update WAY too slower.

      And yeah, I was really upset that I finished it in less than a day. I just want to continue reading a good work like the good student, is it too much to ask? :)
      ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    +1 to Good Student.

    So far it both has and has subverted many tropes in very satisfying ways; the characters feel solidly multi-dimensional, and I like both the prose and the world.

    I have no idea where it's really going and that's amazing.

    PS - seems to update weekly on Mondays?

    I've heard good things about The Good Student but I'm holding off until there's more to sink my teeth into. 

    I will, however, second the recommendation for The Wandering Inn. I really enjoyed reading it, especially after other characters from Earth began showing up. Plus, it gave me feels about a giant ant. That's pretty well done!

    I couldn't make it through the first chapter of The Good Student. Just something about the writing style and grammar. However, I BINGED The Wandering Inn soooooooo hard. It's just soooo good. I was hooked after the first few chapters. Thank you so much for sharing it with me!

      Same here; started reading The Good Student, but the writing is extremely off-putting.  I'm having trouble phrasing why exactly, but I'd describe it as a drone.

      I had the exact opposite reaction, FWIW; TGS was a very easy read for me, whereas TWI took me days to catch up on; it meanders and meanders and nothing happens except for the MC exclaiming this or that.

      > It turns out that every competent/intelligent character in-story is female, and every male is a testosterone-poisoned derp.

      I'm really surprised by this. Yes, there are several characters who are competent/intelligent females, but certainly not all of them are. And I can think of only two characters who fit the "testosterone-poisoned derp" label: Relc and Calruz. But both are still extremely competent. As for other males:

      * Klbkch is male (well, he's a male-type humanoid ant) and is extremely competent - one of the strongest defenders in the city. He's definitely not "derpy" and I don't think he even has testosterone pumping through him. 

      * Pisces is male, but also competent and intelligent... just not socially graceful. He's got an inflated ego but also is hailed as a genius caster. 

      * Olesm is male, highly intelligent but perhaps a bit too experienced to be called "competent." Erin beats him constantly in chess, true, but he's been playing for only a year and she was a step below Grandmaster level. 

      >The story also features several chapters about periods and ice cream.

      Not sure what the problem is here necessarily. The period thing makes a lot of sense - young women don't automatically have their menstrual cycle stop when they get teleported to a fantasy world. And the ice cream thing brought together quite a few threads - the effect that the new arrivals have upon the world, how hiding their origin is becoming increasingly difficult, and the entire thing brings Ryoka to the attention of Lady Magnolia, which expands upon the political and technological interests of the ruling class. Complaining about the ice cream is like complaining about apples being in *Spice and Wolf.*

  Not quite rationalist, but the protagonist does have a ruthlessly efficient mindset: [Youjo Senki: The Sage of Tanya the Evil](http://www.crunchyroll.com/saga-of-tanya-the-evil).  An anime series about a salary man reincarnated into a war torn alternate history in the middle of its analog of World War I (more like 1.5, as the date is slightly later and the technology slightly more advanced, oh and there is flying combat mages).  Excellent action sequences and music, lots of fun dark humor and black comedy, decent quality commentary on human nature, the only real problem is that the character designs leave something to be desired in some cases (Victoria's oversized moe eyes is the worst case I think).  

  But what really held my interest is the psychology of the main character.  In his/her former life, Tanya was a salary man working in HR in a big company.  Possessed of a calculating mindset, he felt no remorse at firing and laying off employees.  After his death, he is confronted by god, who is offended at his lack of faith, and with modern humanity in general.  Our salary man refuses to acknowledge this being as god.  This "god" decides to reincarnate the salaryman in a world filled with suffering, in order to make him have faith.  Reborn as Tanya, an orphaned girl in a war torn empire, Tanya joins the military and sets out to secure a safe, behind-the-lines, desk job.  Unfortunately, her own competence, aptitude as a combat mage, and "Being-X's" (Tanya refuses to call it god in her mental narrative) meddling, see her sent into front-line combat over and over again.  Tanya struggles against "Being-X's" meddling and copes by adopting the same mindset she held in her former life: absolute adherence to the rules of her organization, letter-of-the-law manipulation of said rules, and raw cunning.

  So overall, not quite rationalist (Being-X seems to be short of an all-knowing god and might have been deceived if Tanya could learn to lose and would fake faith; Tanya often overthinks things and reads to much into her superior's comments, leading to her misinterpreting voluntary missions as demands), but certainly a lot of thinking and planning on the main character's part.

    Watched on your recommendation and thoroughly enjoyed, so thanks! But those *eyes* are just awful.
    ```

  - u/TitansTrail:
    ```
    I watched Youjo Senki, but I found it pretty boring. After the initial hook, it's just WW1.5 where some people are wizards and the Germans always win. I couldn't find any reason to care about the characters or the setting. In particular, I was kind of expecting Tanya to show some character development from being thrust into another world, but she's the same all the way through. Sometimes God shows up and complains, but nothing really comes of it. 

    I recommend you approach with caution, if you think you might want to watch this.

  [People Watching](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_saLI-LH-VrxFpFgk467Jn02i46arTyD) is extremely good. Explores themes of depression, identity, death, relationships, and so on from a comical yet mature and thoughtful perspective.
  ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  I've been working my way through the list at topwebfiction.com; sadly not all of it (or even most of it) is rational, but there are still some gems to be had. And some to avoid, IMO.

  [change: new world](http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/14075): Avoid it. *Eventually* you might get drawn into it, and it does improve as time goes on, but the writing isn't very good, the power jumps and rules are seemingly arbitrary, and the author seemingly has no concept of measuring time or distances (I don't care how big your school is, it shouldn't ever take ten minutes to run down a hallway). The world is interesting but basically a trope by now (the world turns into a game and most people die but the high schoolers survive!). I get the impression that the author began this while in high school so there's some amount of wish fulfilment involved. Read about 100 chapters, and it wasn't worth it.

  [Aethernea](http://gravitytales.com/Novel/aethernea/a-chapter-1) is one that I'd stick in the middle of the pack. There are some things I really enjoy, such as the neat ways that the magic systems seem to work and seeing the difference between how super-student Kiel approaches problems compared to how practical-demi-goddess Elaru does. But there's an issue in that Elaru is a Mary Sue character through and through. Beautiful, mysterious, has held every job in the world (while only being a teen, or maybe early 20s), a peerless magic caster, unlimited magical power - she's a manic pixie dream girl in fantasy form. Kiel is too, to a lesser extent, but at least he has some flaws... anyway, the story itself has some neat stuff, and the author often gives hints of things that come into play several chapters later, but overall I find the main characters frustrating. 

  [Delvers, LLC](http://blaise-corvin.com/2016/01/20/delvers-llc-chapter-1/): Again a pretty standard trope - two regular guys are warped to a fantasy world and given powers but told they'll probably die anyway. However, this one I'd rate at slightly better than average. For one, the people sent there are adults (29-30 years old). Their responses make sense as you learn about some of their psychological scars and history. And the secondary characters are pretty decent (they even added a drag queen character recently, which was actually pretty interesting). It's not amazing, but it is one that I'll likely follow up on once more chapters come out. The second book (which all but the last two chapters are available for for free on that site) is being published this week.

  [The Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/2016/07/27/1-00/) is another one I enjoyed. Overplayed trope (Earth kids whisked away to a magical world with a class system and leveling), but interesting in that most of the story revolves around a girl who becomes an innkeeper rather than a hero tasked to save the world. She has a bit of a Bella Swan thing going on wherein everyone who meets her either seems to want to kill her or adores her, but she's not nearly as annoying. Oh, and if you like chess, you'll really like how she thinks. Worth checking out!

  [Heretical Edge](https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/2015/10/03/orientation-1-01/): Still in the middle of reading this (well, 16/20 arcs into it), but I've liked it so far. A teenage girl ends up going to a secret academy where Heretics (humans who can see monsters and absorb their abilities) are trained to protect the rest of humanity. The writing is pretty good, and the author frequently throws twists and turns. Fair warning - the scene can go from jocular to extremely violent and gory very quickly. The author does a great job writing some of the horror scenes. There's not a strong focus on the system of magic or abilities unfortunately, but if you like action, drama, horror, and budding bisexual teenage romance, it's worth checking out. 

  I think that's all for now, besides echoing my usual recommendations of [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/) and [The Gods Are Bastards](https://tiraas.wordpress.com/2014/08/20/book-1-prologue/)!
  ```

  - u/Afforess:
    ```
    Seconding A Practical Guide to Evil and The Gods Are Bastards. TGAB is a bit of a slog in the first three books, but the writing quality really picks up and the world is really interesting. I really, *really* wish the author would go back and re-edit some of the earlier chapters, because it can be a bit off-putting.
    ```

    - u/Cuz_Im_TFK:

    If you liked Henry August, you might like [Replay](https://www.amazon.com/Replay-Ken-Grimwood/dp/068816112X) even though I don't consider it as good. It involves a similar scenario where the character is looping in time, but every time he loops, it's back to a moment in his life where he is closer to death with a shorter and shorter loop. It's very focused on his emotional struggles with his upcoming death and how all of his life's work is undone with each reset and doesn't involve any antagonists.
    ```

  - u/Revisional_Sin:
    ```
    I fucking love/hate Henry August. It has good/adequate world-building, and the image of the ouroboron society stretching forwards and backwards, iterating and growing I find very cool.


    The writing voice is incredible. Henry has a very strong presence and I find the story addictive.

    It's completely ruined by the conflict. The negative externalities caused by the antagonist's efforts are the problem, not his goal. The moralising of the main character about "YOU AM PLAY GOD" drove me crazy.
    ```

    - u/kyle2143:
      ```
      While I liked Henry August as a whole, I don't think I would qualify it was a "rational" story. Partly because of your sam issue with. The reason I think that is because there are several obvious things that the author makes no attempt to explain or even address. I guess it's not necessary according to subreddit rules, but it's one of my personal rules and I think other people can find it a little annoying as well.

      [Henry spoilers](#s " For example, the most annoying part to me was that the time travel, timelines, and how Ouroborans are born didn't make sense from the perspective of the Chronus Club. The whole issue was that 'someone' was causing the world to end sooner and thus Chronus Club members were not being born(i.e. dying). This was a huge deal, but nobody even cared that other Ouroborans were being born/not being born because of the regular choices that every member makes. They thought, as long as you don't try to advance technology, no problem, you can have 100 children, or none at all in every life. And those 'small' choices, affected nothing, which was ridiculous to think. It discounted an incredibly reasonable line of thought just to make the story work. And Ouroborans weren't the rarest things on Earth, any one of the club members could have had a child in one life that was an Ouroboran, but nobody ever found out because they decided not to have that child in a future life.")

  A movie I really enjoyed a while back was The Beauty Inside, about a Korean man who wakes up on his 18th birthday in the body of a 40-year-old man. Then, the next morning, wakes up in the body of a 75-year-old woman. Every morning he wakes up in a new body.

  It's about the life he pieces together for himself, the few friends he can keep, and the question of whether love can exist between people when one of them could be anyone. Not exactly rationalist, but an interesting and well-thought-out premise. I also usually don't enjoy movies with romances as their primary plot, but this was an exception.

    An interesting read, but be prepared for a couple of things that may through you off. First, it is written in a distant, matter of fact way. Like someone telling you the backstory of something, only in broadish strokes. Almost like someone was trying to write a history book or something. Second, there is little polish and there are certain typos that happen often, like "seize" being misspelled as "cease" etc. The latter led me to eventually stop reading the story.

  *Life Is Strange.*

  It's technically a video game, but it more closely resembles a TV miniseries/serial in terms of pacing/plot/length. There are five "episodes," and each episode takes anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to play through (depending on whether you thoroughly explore the world or run through it).

  It would be better to play through it on your own because there are so many choices/decisions you have to make, and most of those choices/decisions have a dramatic impact on events that happen later in the story. However, not everyone owns a PlayStation/Xbox/whatever (as I understand it, a not insignificant chunk of the adult population has no interest in "gaming" (and consequently remains unfortunately unaware of the existence of incredible games like *Life Is Strange*)).

  [You can watch the entire thing here, on YouTube.](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLf-9CurfzeAHBg-zG3JbAsRH1otqDBHQj)

  I couldn't find many playthroughs that had no commentary (this isn't the type of game you want a Pewdiepie or a Markiplier to yell over), and this was the only one with no commentary that also left the in-game music on (music is copyrighted so youtubers can't monetize the video if they leave the music on). The episodes in this particular playthrough average at about 2.5 hours long each. Five episodes at 2.5 hours each is pretty darn similar to one season of a TV show.

  I can just about guarantee you that if you make it through the first 19 minutes and 23 seconds of the first video, you'll be hooked.

  So normally I actively avoid deadfics, to the point where I regularly remove fics I liked and followed from my bookmarks because they haven't gotten updated in a few months. However, there's one fic I read in particular despite the fact that it was dead, because it was just so good. That being, [Equestion: Total War](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/2354/equestria-total-war). If you can't tell from the name, it's an MLP:FiM fic. It's a fascinating depiction of warfare, and I'm just a sucker for darkfics that come from a really lighthearted canon, so long as those darkfics respect the original work.

  I've had the pretty rough couple of weeks, so all my recommendations are mostly comfort food that's helped relax and distract me from my depression and anxiety. They didn't fix any of my problems, but they made the worst days more bearable. Neither of them make any attempt to be rational.

  [The Uncanny Valley](https://www.amazon.com/Uncanny-Valley-Tales-Lost-Chronicles/dp/149485287X) is a very entertaining anthology of simple horror stories. Normally I only go for psychological and cosmic horror whereas this book leans more towards goofy ghost stories for children, but what sells it for me is the extremely tight pacing. Not one of these stories beats around the bush, the author knows how simple and straightforward these tales are so they all get right to the point without leading you on. 

  It's one of the easiest reads I've ever had and even when it wasn't scary it never felt disappointing because it was so pleasant to read. I would call it great, but as *just good* stories go, this does exactly what a *just good* story should do and delivers on what it promises. It's great if you want to read something simple and entertaining or give a child something that's just the right amount of creepy for them.

  [K-On!](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5680/K-On) (first season) is definitely not for everyone, but for someone who needed something mindless to calm me down it was perfect. It exists purely to show cute anime girls hanging out and having a good time, with very little emotional or intellectual depth, but it's well executed for what it is. The animation is excellently directed with a surprising amount of visual storytelling, the characters are charming, the writing consistently made me smile or chuckle, and what little plot there is has good pacing.

  [Changeling Space Program](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/327551/changeling-space-program) (My Little Pony) - the changelings are attempting to be the first on the moon. It has realistic depictions of rocket research and the author is basing the characters' progress on his ability to build a rocket on the Kerbal space game. It's a great read and hilarious. But the updates are on the order of months in between.

  [Replay](https://www.amazon.com/Replay-Ken-Grimwood/dp/068816112X) (Original) - it involves a man repeating his life with the repeats getting closer to his death date each time. It's not what I consider rational in the character's investigation and use of the power, but his emotional struggles were very vivid and well written.

  [The Red Knight](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12141684/1/The-Red-Knight) (Harry Potter) - A great story where Ron goes back in time to his birth, but the world he is reborn into is an AU so he has no idea of what to expect from the future.

  [Forged Destiny](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny) (RWBY) - It's a re-imagining of RWBY as an RPG-like world where everyone is a gamer character and the plot of RWBY is dramatically different as a result. I would recommend anything written by [Couer Al'aran](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6272865/Coeur-Al-Aran). He's a *brilliant* writer.

  [Auburn](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12326784/1/Auburn) (RWBY) - RWBY with Jaune, Weiss, Blake, and Ruby on a team together. The author [Super Saiyan Syndaquil](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6098148/Super-Saiyan-Cyndaquil) has written some other good fanfics, but Auburn's my favorite.

    My favourite Bleach fanfic is ... not really rationalist in any way, and I really can't make an unqualified recommendation of it. I am totally aware that it will not be everyone's cup of tea. [Walk Two Lifetimes](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10572048/1/Walk-Two-Lifetimes) is a SI type of thing with a fairly Mary-Sue-ish main character, like unto such Naruto fics as Dreaming of Sunshine; Inasmuch as it has a plot and tension, it is mostly a romance story. A revised version of the canon Hisana / Byakuya romance is the center of the story. The story goes through some severe tonal changes as the story progresses, starting pretty dark and gritty and moving towards light and wholesomeness and comedy. It's got pretty good writing overall, though. 

    In a similar boat is Tozette's [Four Body Problem](http://archiveofourown.org/works/8748340/chapters/20054959) where everyone has PTSD from an endless and terrible war, and then a core part of the cast is sent back in time from a dystopic future to the start of Bleach with their mental issues but also their abilities. Then a bunch of comedy, healing, etc occur, with a side order of slightly ambiguous gay romance stuff. Again, *definitely* not something that will be everyone's cup of tea. Again, not particularly rationalist. 

    I also liked comedy crossover fic [There May Be Some Collateral Damage](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5030443/chapters/11562568) - a HP/Bleach cross where Ichigo ends up guarding Harry Potter. It's basically pure humor/crack, but I enjoyed it a lot without taking it at all seriously.

  I feel like the Starship's Mage books by Glynn Stewart would be enjoyed by this reddit. I don't think they're *especially* rational, but the characters are reasonably intelligent and rarely hold the idiot ball. Perhaps more importantly, they're a lot of fun.

  I've also been reading N. K. Jemisin's ~~Implausibly large number of~~ Hundred Thousand Kingdoms books recently. They're pretty good, though I think I prefer her recent books (Fifth Season, etc), partly because I really like world building with a sense of a really extensive history.

  (On which note, if you have any recommendations for other books with that sense, I'd appreciate it)

  Looking for podcast versions of rational fiction, similar to the HPMoR podcast. Any advice?
