## Pyrebound 10.3

### Post:

As ever, let me know what works, doesn't work, raises weird questions, etc.  Thanks for reading!

    I suppose their relationship is developing about as quickly as you could reasonably expect it to, given Imbri's fear of impulsive behavior and Ram's borderline possession by a spirit with seriously assholish tendencies.
