  ```
  Very interesting story. As someone who has studied history I cannot commend the main point more.

    ```
    Not the best-written story, but for something published in '03 it speaks surprisingly well to the present.  See EG the Princeton/Woodrow Wilson debacle from '15.

  ```
  Why would "tax payers" put up with such a waste of resources? It declares that time travel doesn't change the time line and they kill them painlessly. The entire thing is completely pointless

    ["Third-party punishment, also known as altruistic punishment, refers to a phenomenon in which a person or party is punished for violation of social norms by an outside observer who is not directly affected by the violation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_punishment)

    ["Altruistic punishment means that individuals punish, although the punishment is costly for them and yields no material gain"](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6868/abs/415137a.html)
    ```

  ```
  So they create timelines and then collapse them( killing billions of people )only to punish  people that did things that they considered bad in the original timeline .I don't even know what to say.
