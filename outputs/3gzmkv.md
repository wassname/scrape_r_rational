  Magic via multi-dimensional nanobots?

  On an unrelated note, have you read Ra?
  ```

    ```
    They might be nanobots, you're actually the first person to guess that as far as I can tell, ^_^

    And of course I've read Ra :P
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Tiny metallic rings that can interface with brains and propagate instructions, which have self-replication constrained by a) population size and b) human instruction? Of course they're nanobots, the question is whether they're natural or artificial.
