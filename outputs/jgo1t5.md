  Hmmm. In real life, the great advantage of early firearms was not that they were more effective in combat, but that they made peasant armies possible. A peasant with six months of training with traditional weapons was almost worthless in battle against a professional soldier, but a peasant with six months of firearm training could be almost as good - and there were a lot more peasants than professional soldiers around. (Napoleon was the first leader to push this strategy to its logical extreme; he  implemented nationwide conscription and ended up with an army so much bigger than the standing armies of France's neighbors that he could have been a much worse general than he actually was and still won battle after battle until his enemies became more afraid of him than of giving their own peasants the means to overthrow them.)

  Also, historically, most war casualties in the age of guns were caused by cannons and explosive artillery, not bullets - even during World War 1. (Cannonballs didn't just kill the soldiers they hit, they threw up debris when they hit the ground  that killed soldiers in a blast radius.)

    You need to go back even earlier than Napoleon.  The reason that firearms replaced bows is that bows took a lifetime of training and conditioning, and a 16th century arquebusier was considered trained to an acceptable level in as little as two weeks.  A man at arms took a similar amount of training vs a pikeman.   This also happened at the same time that Europe was recovering and then surpassing the population hole that the black death had created in the mid 14th century.  There were way more people, but the supply of trained bowmen and men at arms remained constant.    


    On top of this, you finally had hardened steel full-plate armor showing up, which was effectively immune to arrows.  Only early firearms, and at very close range, could penetrate that.    


    All of this was happening circa 1500 or so(1450 to around 1580), 300 years before Napoleon.  


    You're also wrong about World War 1.  World War 1 was the first war that artillery was the main cause of fatalities.  Prior to that, it was always disease that was the biggest killer in war, not guns or cannon.

      The weapons technology certainly existed before Napoleon, but the social technology to mobilize an entire population the size of France didn't. Pre-Revolution France and its neighbors were ruled by aristocrats who quite rationally feared that if they raised a peasant army, it would end up turning against them - and who also lacked the ability to collect taxes on a scale needed to pay and equip an army the size of Napoleon's (because most of the wealth was held by other aristocrats who could credibly threaten to rebel if their taxes were raised).

      (The social technology to mobilize the entire population may also have existed in England, but  England was an island and projected power with its navy instead.)

        You're flat out wrong regarding the fear of aristocrats regarding "peasant armies".

        Guns predated Napoleon, as did mass armies.  The sizes of armies during the Revolutionary Wars / Napoleon wars were simply an extension of the increasing size of armies since the 15th century.  Look at the size of armies in the Seven Years War, the largest continental war immediately preceding the Revolutionary/Napoleonic era.   Multiple corps and armies of five figures moving during campaigns, and clashing multiple times in a year.

        The vast majority of the soldiers on all sides were peasants(often conscripted levies), including France, Austria, Prussia, (all of whom were despotic absolute monarchies, and according to you, should have been afraid to do this).   You can follow this trend backwards to the war of Austrian succession, thirty years war, Dutch Wars of Independence, etc.

        &#x200B;

        These are not new things, and this is not a change from the preceeding several centuries.  The real change came centuries earlier, when armies ceased to consist of nobles and their highly trained(nearly since they could walk) retinues, and began instead to be made up of professional non-nobles, who took up soldiering as a profession, instead of as a class.  This trend toward professionalization can be traced all the way back to the english Balliol-Beaumont army and the Battle of Duplin-Moor, and was something that hadn't been seen in widespread use since the roman empire.  It is also the underlying reason for the dominance of the English in the first part of the Hundred Years War.  


        The trend toward professionalization happened in parallel(and actually predates) the mass adoption of gunpowder.  This is rooted in economic trends from the Agricultural revolution.  Increasing crop yields per acre and per farmer created both a increasing population, and an larger amount of surplus labour to devote to things other than subsistence farming, like war(and commerce, and science, etc).

      Not meant as criticism, just some relevant trivia. I didn't read the story yet! :)

      A longbow wielded by a professional archer did have a higher rate of fire than early firearms and I think they would probably have been competitive even during Napoleon's time. You'd probably have to get as advanced as the breech-loading rifles used in the American Civil War to definitively outclass them - but they still drastically lose the numbers game, though!  Crossbows were like a worse version of guns; easy to learn to use and effective, but the reload time was sufficiently bad that they never displaced longbows.
      ```

      - u/Geminii27:
        ```
        Yup. Longbows were better than the firearms of the time, but longbow-*users* were far less available. And the longbow had been around for a while - I'm going to guess that improvements on it were starting to be incremental and far between, compared to the relatively new science of firearms, which still had plenty of low-hanging fruit to grab.
        ```

      - u/TwoxMachina:

        JeorgSprave made a magazine for a bow, that makes it kind of crossbow, but not.

        No skill needed, can burst fire rapidly. Could sustain high rate of fire if you have a 2nd bow, and a partner to load for you.

        The bottleneck becomes, the logistics of getting enough arrows to fire.
        ```

        - u/DiscreteDisco:
          ```
          The logistics of getting enough arrows is important, but the cost of production is more important. A smith specializing in recreating medieval weapons created a version of it with medieval technology and claimed that it was harder to make than a crossbow (which were very expensive at that time, and to my knowledge were only used in special situations or by special units in armies). [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF0UkLRP18c](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF0UkLRP18c) . So he believed, (and joergSprave agrees in the comments) that the the magazine bows (referred to as SIL)  would be a specialist weapon because it would be prohibitively expensive to field entire armies with it. They also have shorter range than normal bows so it becomes a trade off between range, speed, and cost of production.
          ```

    - u/SayNiceShit:
      ```
      This is exactly wrong.  Longbows are 20 to 40x faster than an early firearm.

      Even the best arquebusiers could barely fire every couple of minutes.  A longbowman could loose a dozen arrow per minute.

      Mostly I'm wondering where the evolution in firearms is here: Early firearms were primitive and took a long time to load, and arrows actually *can* be fired pretty rapidly. 

      Also, if guns can be enchanted, why not armor? Not that you'd need enchantmentsâ€”layered cotton armor was often sufficient protection for a few centuries. 

      The only way this works is if the humans went from "no guns" to "near-modern guns." Otherwise, the elves are only in a pickle for the short term.

          It's selective pressure from all sides. 

          Guns were used because they offered some slight advantage, but then there were responses to that development, and this back-and-forth fueled the development of guns and armor for centuries, without a single wielder of the fire-lance or cannon ever imagining the revolver or the submachine gun. 

          If there's no back-and-forth like this, then guns might still develop along certain lines in order to improve hunting (I'm actually a bit doubtful there, because the use of guns for hunting took a few generations of improvement, but if you've got dragons or something then IDK, that could work), but nobody's going to invent e.g. a revolver because the specific pressures which led to the revolver don't exist. 

          And if there *is* a back-and-forth then the elves should already be acquainted with these weapons in a (less advanced) form. "Humans just invented the Gatling gun" is more plausible here than "humans very quickly through half a millennium of firearms development and the elves noticed none of it."

            It certainly sounds like the humans and elves haven't had a war in the last couple hundred years. According to the prologue:

            >Even after some human nations gained sovereignty, the economics of magic were too much of a hurdle for them to overcome. After all, one competent wizard could produce more than a town's entire workforce. Unfair trade agreements ensured that their governments were still reliant on the elvish empire for most of their industries, keeping them subservient even after earning their freedom. 

            Subservient human empires which rely on the elves to supply them with basic commodities will probably not attempt to start a war with them, and in fact would probably come down pretty harshly on anyone they catch who threatens their relations with the elves. That doesn't entirely preclude outlaws, but I imagine most of the elves are using magical gear, plus many of them are spellcasters, and they're long-lived so they usually have enough experience to not make foolish mistakes. As such, they'd be hard targets and I imagine human outlaws would be reluctant to carry out some high-profile attack against them instead of easier victims that few would care about.

            For the plot to make sense, the humans must have developed revolvers for use in their conflicts against each other, or as part of government-funded initiative to develop weapons capable of defeating the elves. Either way, once revolvers come into play, it makes it possible for a band of human outlaws to conceivably attack an elven merchant convoy. You're no longer limited to one shot followed by nearly 30 seconds of reloading while the elven spellcasters turn everything around you into a glassy crater. It's still high-profile and risky, but at least it's not suicidal at that point.

        Time and enchanters, perhaps? Properly enchanted armor might be able to shrug off early bullets, but full armor enchantment might take quite some time, and tie up an enchanter for that period. And enchanters capable of the work might take decades, if not centuries, to train to that level. Bullet-proofing imbuements are presumably not the first page of spellcrafting 101.

    It's a good story! And the strength seems pretty consistent so far (I'm about 15 chapters in) so you know whether you like it by the first chapter.

    > I think there's enough rational elements in it that people here might enjoy it regardless 

    I agree that think it belongs here, a lot of people here like the "market" subgenre
