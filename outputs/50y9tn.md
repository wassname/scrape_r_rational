## [D] Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

The Powers:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *clearly* defined rules that are consistent. The powers may be original or may be from an already realised story.

* The power to be munchkined can not be something broken like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.

The Reverse Munchkin:

* In these scenarios, we will find ways to beat someone or something with a power which is, well, *powerful*.

The Problem:

* In which we solve problems.

Note; All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  * You have the power to detect every water molecule within about fifteen feet.  You don't have Taylor's power of super-multitasking, so you're not really processing every detail you have access to; you can focus on something to get more detail on it (and less detail on other things), but if you don't, you'll only get as much detail as you can handle.
  * You can also teleport any water molecule to the general location of any other water molecule, and, for the sake of actual usefulness, may do this en masse for large groupings of water molecules.  For example, if there are two glasses of water in front of you, each half full, you can drain one and fill the other through teleportation.  (I'll give you a freebie here and point out that you can kill people within your range by draining the water from their bodies into the surrounding moisture.)
  * How to best make use of this power?

    I could see this being used to cure cancer by selectively killing cancer cells. Not confident because that might require super multitasking. At the very least, you could use it to detect and kill cancerous looking clumps as soon as they start to form.

    You could also dissolve atherosclerotic plagues, kill infectious cysts, etc. And your skin could always be hydrated, helping you maintain a youthful appearance / be comfortable. Maybe use skin conditioning tricks to make people feel suddenly comfortable whenever they enter your radius -- a nice thing to do, with possible operant conditioning implications. (Making them uncomfortable every time they do something you don't like would be the evil option.)

    It should also be possible to use the teleportation as a cutting tool, since you can increase and decrease the size of a fine point. Creating a vibration at any frequency in just about any object would also possible, since everything has some water in it.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Selectively killing cancer cells is really difficult because you can't see them and don't necessarily know where they are. Sure, you can see all the water molecules, but the hydration profiles of basically all living cells are more-or-less identical. You won't be able to tell one from another.

      If you know exactly where a tumor is, you can teleport out the water...but then you have to deal with the fallout of mass cell apoptosis. Turns out, cell death releases toxic chemicals into the surrounding tissue which can cascade into more cell death. This is why surgeons actually remove tumors instead of, for instance, injecting them with localized poison.

      Killing surface cysts should be doable, or at least draining them of excess fluid and allowing healing to begin, but I'm not sure about cysts deeper in the body. You will never have acne because you could safely exterminate bacteria on your skin, but depending upon how the power works this might require too much concentration.

    I suggest hiring a plane and then teleporting clouds of water into a highly compressed sphere. Make the plane fly at a uniform speed so that your range changes every second, drag on the sphere by teleporting every millisecond.

    It will take some time, therefore revert the sphere back into a cloud whenever you need to rest/refuel. Revert for the last time over some region with a drought. Let it rain. 

    You can make a profit by charging money, but that depends on your moral scale.

    Edit: Compress many clouds in that sphere, it must be better than spraying water from airplanes.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      For a service like that? I would absolutely charge money!

      So that I could reinvest it into doing it for free in areas that can't afford my fees, of course. Planes cost money.
      ```

    - u/Icare0:
      ```
      Why gather from clouds? Go to the nearest ocean and teleport away. Since you only teleport water molecules, you effectively will be running the best and cheapest water purification engine ever.
      ```

    ```
    > You can also teleport any water molecule to the general location of any other water molecule

    Are there limits on the rate you can teleport at, or else the pressure you can teleport the water into?  I'd look into buying a nozzle of some kind, and using it to power a long-range (>15 feet) cutting stream.

    If you have good enough aiming, you can also create water explosions next to any object, and use that force to move it like normal telekinesis.

    You may not have good cancer detection abilities (what does the water-profile of a tumor look like?) but you do have a good non-invasive surgery option in dehydrating and rehydrating selected tissues.

    EDIT: I assume the teleportation is reactionless.  Teleport the stream coming out of the cutting nozzle (or a different nozzle) back into the reservoir, and make a jetpack/rocket that you can refuel yourself.

  You know that feeling when you have a word on the tip of your toungue, but can't remember it?

  You have the ability to tell when people in a fifty meter radius are suffering from it, and can provide exactly the word they want.

  Your goal is to directly cause* the deaths of between ten thousand and a hundred thousand people within the next six months. No more, no less.

  *For the purposes of "directly cause" I mean that you take an action that someone else couldn't have taken, that leads, with your knowledge, to someone's death. So ordering a soldier to kill someone works.
  ```

    ```
    One's best start here would be becoming a language instructor at ISIS. Since people who learn foreign language tend to have this problems more often.

    From there, you try to get miraclous reputation as a telepath.

    Another good idea would be finding an old billionaire suffering of Alzheimers. 

    Or finding a country with the oldest Defence minister and becoming a secretary/aide.

    Anyway, your best bet would be  your target growing on to trust you, and conditionnally operating to always repeat your suggestion, only to give them the wrong word in the heat of the moment, where live communication matters

  Power:

  You can read all the memories of the people you touch. The catch is that you can only use it thrice.

  The Reverse Munchkin:

  Kill a man with the power to heal from any injury not self
  inflicted.

  The Problem:

  Coming Soon.

  - u/DaWaffledude:
    ```
    > Kill a man with the power to heal from any injury not self inflicted.

    He can heal from injuries, but they'll still hurt. Incapacitate him (Repeatedly tasing him should work), bring him to a cell filled with some kind of horrible torture, and give him an easy means of suicide.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      There's actually a much easier way than getting him to kill himself. Just encase him in concrete or collapse a mine on top of him or something, if he ever got out it would be in thousands (or if you did a really good job) maybe even millions of years.
      ```

      - u/DaWaffledude:
        ```
        He's still going to break out eventually, and now you (or your descendants) have to deal with an immortal man who's spent the last few thousand years planning his revenge. 

        Besides which, the challenge was specifically to kill him
        ```

        - u/vakusdrake:
          ```
          If it would take him millions of years to escape then by the time he does either humans wiped ourselves out or we're post singularity. Either way collapsing a abandoned mine on him seems like it would work pretty damn well.    
          Even if it only took him thousands of years to escape the same thing I said before is likely to apply, either way by the time he gets out his power will have very little use.
          ```

    - u/gods_fear_me:
      ```
      It will work.
      ```

    > You can read all the memories of the people you touch. The catch is that you can only use it thrice.

    I'll assume this is a limited-uses version of Aro's power (*Luminosity*).  The obvious win seems to be picking three world leaders, or perhaps three elderly experts in orthogonal-but-synergistic fields.

    > Kill a man with the power to heal from any injury not self inflicted.

    Survivable suicide bombings, if the trigger is creative.

  - u/TBestIG:
    ```
    > Kill a man with the power to heal from any injury not self inflicted

    Depends on how you define self inflicted, but I'd go with the Steelheart route. Button that activates explosives, get him to press it.
    ```

    - u/gods_fear_me:
      ```
      It must be willing self-harm.
      ```

      - u/TBestIG:
        ```
        Well there goes that idea. 

        Assuming he's not any different from a regular human other than the regeneration, torture should be an effective method of convincing him to commit suicide.
        ```

        - u/gods_fear_me:
          ```
          Yes
          ```

          - u/gabbalis:
            ```
            Well in that case. The classic solution: http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1543-j
            ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    Dehydration, asphyxiation  and starvation aren't generally considered injuries, so lock the man inside something air tight and wait for him to die. If you consider them injuries then it's time to drive someone to suicide, depending on his personality there are a few ways to do that, capture his closest friends and family, strap a bomb to them, tell him if he commits suicide you will release them and if he doesn't you will blow them up, if this doesn't work then blow them up, he might become suicidal, though that's not likely. If that doesn't work then torture him and provide the means to commit suicide, the torture should be pretty easy and horrific seeing as you don't need to worry about accidentally killing him.

  So, if you had The Magic Pudding, it would of course be easy to destabilise economies and so forth. But how far could you take it?

  It apparently violates conservation of energy and momentum, but is there a way to turn it into an interstellar stardrive, for example?

  Could you colonise Mars, or better yet, Venus? Or Pluto?

  Note that the pudding's regeneration is not instantaneous, since it is possible to cut a slice of it; but it can be assumed to grow back essentially immediately once that slice is removed. Also, its composition can apparently be changed, although the limitations of this transformation are not made clear, since the only example was converting it from a steak-and-kidney pudding to a plum duff and back again.

    It's not clear what you're talking about, it's generally a good idea to link to something that explains what you're talking about.

  Munchkinry challenge!

  Powerset: Roughly [Chandra Nalaar](http://magic.wizards.com/en/story/planeswalkers/chandra-nalaar)'s powers, minus planeswalking.  In other words,

  * Lots of fire and explosions, limited by mana availability. Also, feeling some sort of strong passion at the time of casting is required to use the biggest spells.  Feeling apathy or despair reduces your spells' effectiveness, and sufficient hopelessness can prevent casting anything at all.
  * Ability to show off with fire on your hair and hands, along with correspondingly glowing eyes.  (This automatically triggers upon extreme passions or when casting large spells, and may be manually used separately.  Technically a spell in its own right, but draws only a tiny amount of mana to sustain.)
  * Unusually high body temperature (always-on), but not so high as to be uncomfortable to other people's touch.  Raising it further (over part or all of your body) is a simple spell, but takes more mana the more you raise it.
  * Immunity to heat and your own fire (also always-on, draws no mana).
  * Ability to draw mana and hold onto it for as long as desired.  Mana pool size is limited only by how much you can find.

  The setting:

  * Easy mode: Earth as we know it, except that places generate mana as would be expected in *Magic: the Gathering*.  You mostly need [Mountains](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=289321), which can be locations like large foundries or boilerworks.  No one else can access mana.  You can also bond to a location, allowing you to draw on its mana when not physically there, by spending 8 hours there studying the location.
  * Hard mode: Earth as we know it, but land does *not* generate mana.

  In either case, you start with a small pool of manabonds, which supply enough mana for you to throw a fist-sized fireball every minute or hold your body temperature at up to 110 degrees Celsius continuously.

  The challenge: Take over the world.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    For hard mode, the obvious answer is to hold mana for twenty years. At that point, you should be able to get your body up to 4400 C constantly for six months, or sacrifice larger chunks of mana for a couple minutes at a million C, which should be enough to just...walk into any world capital and melt it. Topple governments at will, gain cult following, etc etc.

    Also, ohmygod what do you think of the Aetherborn?

      The shock and awe approach, then.  Although if you're asked to repeat such feats frequently...

      > Also, ohmygod what do you think of the Aetherborn?

      I have not yet had time to form a proper opinion on the Aetherborn, since I have been spending most of my free time trying to finish an M:tG rational and meta-rational fic.
