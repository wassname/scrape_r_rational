## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I have taken up piano as a hobby but am struggling with the finger dexterity parts of playing. I have small hands so playing some of the beginner pieces is becoming a struggle for me. To offset this frustration I've taken to practicing for only 50 minutes at a time. 

  Does anyone else have techniques or routines for practicing things they are struggling to force themselves to do?

    Try a smaller piano?

      I actually laughed out loud. That's such a simpler concept that it didn't even occur to me.

        Also 50 minutes at a time is plenty for a hobby.

          I guess. I'm just really struggling with getting my hands to play separate rhythms. I was never very dextrous so it feels like each new song or exercise is a very vast mountain to struggle over.

          That feels like "80 years is plenty for a life.".

            I'm hardpressed to regularly find 50min/day on a 40hr/week work schedule.

    Like using a keyboard and a mouse at the same time, what you need is time. If you get tired of one piece, feel free to discard it and try something else. The point at this phase isn't actually to complete anything, it's to *get more practice*.
