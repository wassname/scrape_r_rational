  He's prepping them for a war.  Interesting.
  ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    Well, he's _Lieutenant_ Surge after all eh?
    ```

  - u/VivaLaPandaReddit:
    ```
    Also potentially trained Pokemon going rogue. Red has shown it's possible to untrain a Pokemon, and it wouldn't be suprising if other psychics knew about it. A powerful psychic who abused that ability in a city could cause a lot of havock.
    ```

    - u/archpawn:
      ```
      So, Renegades?
      ```

      - u/partner555:
        ```
        That's what Blue thought, but given Surge's surprise, I'm reasonably certain he was more focused on just the war thing.
        ```

      - u/VivaLaPandaReddit:
        ```
        Renegades but instead of trying to command the Pokemon, just try to turn as many as possible
        ```

  - u/ThrowAway701185:
    ```
    Seems like Lt. Surge knows about Mewtwo and is preparing for a potential fiasco. Or he suspects the war brewing between Magma and Aqua in Hoenn could spill over to Kanto. Giovanni was discussing it in one of the older chapters.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I highly doubt he knows about Mewtwo, but war is always a possibility, yeah.
      ```

  - u/nipplelightpride:
    ```
    It feels like war and renegades aren't a meaningful enough distinction for Surge to be surprised by the answer.
    ```

    - u/partner555:
      ```
      In the culture of the setting, yes there is.

      Renegades are considered traitors to humanity for daring to use Pokemon against their fellow people.

      Soldiers are people serving their nation and fight using military ordnance. The use of Pokemon would at best be limited to non-combat roles.

      Actually using Pokemon to fight directly in wars would likely be considered a war crime of the highest order.
      ```

      - u/ThrowAway701185:
        ```
        I think no... there's a battle of Surge described in Chapter 60. It suggests Pokemon were used quite freely in war. Surge says the war he fought in was the first to use Pokeballs, but wouldn't be the last.
        ```

      - u/nipplelightpride:
        ```
        Ah, ok, I missed that distinction. Thanks!
        ```

- u/MaddoScientisto:
  ```
  I just want to say that the checking the bins thing was a masterful reference to the games
  ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    Also the part where Blue and MG use trash cans to conduct electricity. I thought that was the nod to the games, but no, daystar went explicit with it immediately after that part.
    ```

  - u/empocariam:
    ```
    Checking the trash cans is exactly the sort of "higher resolution" effect that great fan fic like origin of species can provide. I loved it!
    ```

  - u/sibswagl:
    ```
    Keep in mind that a lot of the battling was off-screen. It seems like some people got a few smaller fights, and then there were a few "boss battles" -- the rotom, blastoise, and maybe the electabuzz early on.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > planning and searching

    And *cooperating*. After all, that's what prompted these scenarios in the first place.
    ```

- u/DonaldShimoda:
  ```
  Great chapter. Very exciting that Blue thought of Red with some understanding and without negativity, even if just for a moment.
  ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Hey everyone, welcome back! For those that have been asking, I'll be updating the team roster on my site sometime this month. Also, quick shout out to /u/partner555 for making a[ tvtropes page](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/PokemonTheOriginOfSpecies) for the story!
  ```

  - u/blazeblaster11:
    ```
    Would it be possible to have them hoverable? it's possible to do with some basic CSS and you could put as much or as little information there as you wanted
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      I'm sure it's super possible, and many people have brought it up before.... I just don't have the time/energy to do it right now : / Any free time spent working on that is time I'm not spending writing, or doing podcast stuff (which is already woefully behind), or catching up on my reading list. If most readers were on my site rather than fanfic I might think it's worth the investment, but so far that hasn't been the case.
      ```

- u/Grasmel:
  ```
  A real search and rescue mission would use bikes, yes. I assume they couldn't do that because then the search area would have to be bigger to compensate, and that night make coordination tricky for Surge.
  ```

- u/Gummysaur:
  ```
  Every chapter I get more and more excited for the inevitable confrontation between Blue and Red. I honestly think Blue will realize he's wrong at *some* point, only because if he doesn't that would be a hit to his character, but my worry is that Red (or at least, "Past Red") will have internalized the whole "you should have gone in after her" thing to the point that it's too late to take it back. 

  What I *want* is for them to make up and go back to being best bros but looking at the source material this fic is based on, it's not likely. I can dream, though!
  ```

  - u/Slinkinator:
    ```
    I'm fine with Blue committing to being an ass about this, reading stupid smart people I can empathize with is rare.
    Interesting, in that I think I empathize but don't sympathize with blue. When I extend sympathy to someone there's an element of kindness to it, while I feel empathy towards blue there's also a lot of loathing there.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Whenever I empathize with someone but don't feel any sympathy, it's usually because they remind me of my worst traits. Is it the same for you?
      ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    I'm still not convinced Red was right. I said this way back, in response to the chapter where Blue and Gramps and Daisy took down the Titanic Trio: Just because you happen to have been correct one time does not mean the thought process you used to make your decisions was a good one. Someone who buys lottery tickets and wins is still an idiot for buying lottery tickets.

    Red managed to avoid a pointless death *that time*, but it does NOT mean he was right to decide as he did. I'm not on Blue's side either. I just don't know. It's an incredibly hard thing to figure out.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I don't think that Red's decision making process was like buying a lottery ticket. I think *entering the building* was buying a ticket; it might save (win) many lives, or it might just cost one for no benefit.
      ```

    - u/Gummysaur:
      ```
      It is a very tricky thing, but I think Blue has not really considered the emotional impact of what he's done. He hasn't thought "Wow, that was an incredibly difficult call for Red to make, he must feel terrible even though his choice was what kept him alive in the end." He straight up told Red "then you should have died", and I *know* he means that more metaphorically than literally, but it's still a terrible thing to say to someone who just psychically felt their own friend die in a fire.

      That isn't to say that Red didn't say some bad things himself--the whole "Aiko thought she had to go in there because of you" didn't help his argument at all, he just said it to hit Blue where he knew it would hurt--but to be fair, Blue struck first. I don't think either of them are 100% morally free of blame, but I think Red is definitely in the right in this particular argument, if only for the fact that if he didn't do what he did he'd literally just be dead.

      I understand your point, though. Blue's main issue isn't of what Red *did,* but rather the fact that Red thinks "I was in the right and I'd do it again." However, we know that ever since that argument, Red has indeed been doubting himself--the "Past Red" part of him, for sure, says that he feels "guilty about Aiko" and that he's still not sure if he did the right thing. I think current Red is operating off pure logic, because he's partitioning off his emotions, but when he allows himself to feel everything he realizes his...I can't call it a "mistake" in good faith, to be honest. He knew it was too risky. He knew he would die. I can't wrap my head around how Blue can blame him for thinking "If I could do it again, I would take the option that wouldn't kill me," solely from a human nature standpoint (never mind the fact that Red's greatest fear is death). And if it bugs him that badly, why can't he just accept that, in his terms, Red is a coward? Why does he have to completely cut all connection and make Red believe that one of his only friends wishes he were dead? He wishes Red went into that building, so therefore, he wishes Red had died. If this is how Red is thinking right now, I can't blame him at all. Maybe part of my judgment is just coming out of pity for Red.

      Anyway, uh. Sorry for writing an essay. This whole thing is really complex and part of me wanted to just get my thoughts on it down somewhere. :p
      ```

      - u/OmniscientQ:
        ```
        Please, don't apologize for giving actual thought to the subject and having a lot to say. I *like* these kinds of responses. There's far too many "Cool chapter, bro" responses to a lot of the fiction I enjoy.

        And now, having said that, I don't actually have anything more to add to this, since we seem to be thinking along the same lines.

        Cool response, bro.
        ```

      - u/apkumn:
        ```
        > I think Blue has not really considered the emotional impact of what he's done. He hasn't thought "Wow, that was an incredibly difficult call for Red to make, he must feel terrible even though his choice was what kept him alive in the end."

        Not only that but blue needs to realize that what he wants his grandfather to do is basically what red did, not help someone if it means their death.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          The difference being that Professor Oak actually succeeded in rescuing his family members, and events proved that Red would have failed and died if he had entered the building. Both of them apparently made the right call in their particular circumstances. And yet Blue disagrees with both of them. He would have had his grandfather stay out, potentially losing Daisy and/or a number of civilians, yet he would conversely have sent Red into the building to die.

          What makes Blue's attitude even worse is that he claimed to Red that it was a matter of principle. "That's what it means to be someone's *friend*," Blue says, looking back at Red now. "That's what you don't get, Red. You're talking about risk and the smart thing to do like it's a game, like your decisions don't say things about who you are, how people see you. Forget strangers you're on a mission with, how could anyone trust you to have their back on a journey, if they know that's how you see things?" And yet, after making such a bold "friends stick together even if it's risky" stand, he immediately about-faces when it's his own grampa at stake. Well, I say that makes him a huge hypocrite.
          ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      Red made the right call. Entering the building was risky when unsure of stability.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I agree he made the right call, but it's more complex than that. Staying out was risky too, because it meant that people definitely wouldn't be saved when perhaps they could have been. The question is, how great are those risks; are they justified by their potential returns, or not? Red judged not in this case, and the outcome suggests he was correct.

        Blue claimed that once a friend was going in, he should have ignored weighing risks and gone in on principle. And then he abruptly about-faced when his grandfather did just that. And he didn't even recognise that he'd contradicted himself.
        ```

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        The decision Red had to make during the attack is a tough one and if he made a mistake there it's a very understandable one.

        The decision both of them made to be a complete ass about it afterwards is a much bigger and much more obvious mistake.
        ```

- u/I_Probably_Think:
  ```
  What an awesome "gym" "battle"!

  I have to admit, it was a bit tricky following the six different characters on Blue's team when several of them were not already very familiar. I liked the hints of characterization we got for them but it was all too brief for much of that!
  ```

- u/ManyCookies:
  ```
  >  One hand rises to his ear piece, and he says, in a voice that surprises him with how calm he sounds, “Did anyone think to check the dumpsters and trash bins?”

  I see what you did there.
  ```

  - u/Gummysaur:
    ```
    RIP to Red ever finding the great ball in the trashcan at the SS Anne
    ```

    - u/partner555:
      ```
      Given the setting, the only times I can think off for a functional Great Ball to be in the trash are:
      * The owner was careless 
      * A renegade planted it there for an attack like that programmer guy
      ```

      - u/PDNeznor:
        ```
        Given how the staff was having problems with loose pokemon, I'd like to think that a passing cleaning crew would see a stray greatball and say "did somebody drop this? Into the trash it goes!"
        ```

- u/ThrowAway701185:
  ```
  Great chapter.

  With the League officials furious as they are, I don't think they'll agree with the scenarios anymore. How much will that affect Surge though? I don't think he'll care particularly, but can the League punish gyms for disagreeing with the convention?

  Also, in the last chapter:

  > [Blue says] "... It's not like we're training to put down a trainer uprising, or hunt teams of well coordinated renegades."

  > Surge seems to have something to say to that, but restrains himself as Mr. Iha says ...
  ```

- u/Memes_Of_Production:
  ```
  (Great chapter as always) I am actually very surprised at the choice of teammates, it feels like Blue went with virtually none of his closets teammates for this one, no Glen, no Elaine, etc. I understand that they were practicing as opposed teams, but I imagine the plot structure also factored in - Blue spent the vast majority of the scenario separate from everyone else, so there wasnt going to be big character beats like Red+Leaf in the storm. Minimal personal investment leads to a focus on the battle.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    > none of his closets teammates

    I don't think Blue would want anyone close to him to be in the closet ;). Although, in fairness, he does have his own secrets, like being Dark.
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      Blue rejecting that Elaine kiss cause he is just waiting for that Glenn kiss ;) Though good point actually, has he mentioned being dark to anyone on his team? Not sure if that has come up yet.
      ```

      - u/partner555:
        ```
        http://daystareld.com/pokemon-54/

        Blue says this while they’re trying to figure out the Absol’s power: “But I’m Dark,” Blue points out. “It would have to be a Ghost or Dark attack, and I’ve never heard of an attack like that.”

        So at least the Diglett Cave Expedition Group knows.
        ```

- u/Chemstdnt:
  ```
  I kept expecting the last survivor to be in the voltorb building, being a suicidal mission and making Blue confront the same situation Red had to (since Sabra knew and helped prepared the challenge). Maybe he would have lost the challenge after entering the building and Sabra or Surge would've given him a talk that made him realize he was wrong about Red. When apologizing to Red, Red would have told him with tears in his eyes that if it were Blue who entered that building, he would have followed him to his death.

  I just hate them being like this :)

  Unfortunately, I caught up with the updates so it will be months until we find out what happens. Damn.
  ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  Trainers who are just working their way through gyms expecting regular battles would fail this *so hard*...
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Yep. It's meant to be for people who want to get a badge as part of a group, like if Blue, Red and Leaf had all been challenging gyms together.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      So...regular one-on-one badge challenges are still an option?
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Oh, yeah, for sure.

        ...For now at least. But forcing people to only challenge as groups would probably be a much bigger deal with the League.
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          I don't think it would be desirable to refuse single challenges entirely. But he could perhaps amp up the difficulty level, especially in a way that requires a balanced team instead of just a strong individual Pokemon, or for trainers who have demonstrated disrespect for the group scenarios.
          ```

- u/ForMyWork:
  ```
  Great chapter! I enjoyed how the new gym scenario played out, and the bin realisation was great. I thought it was a nice touch to have Surge open as a challenge and Blue realise that it was an obstacle to overcome.
  ```

- u/NukeNoodles:
  ```
  I love the voltorb building! I wonder if Surge put it in there to force Blue to deal with a dilemma similar to Red's during the Zapdos attack or if it was just coincidence.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I'll give Blue this much credit, I suspect he would have gone into the Voltorb building if one of his team members needed rescuing from inside. He's still a hypocrite for trying to stop his grandfather from doing the same.

  Depending on the circumstances and decisions involved, would Lt Surge have given someone who lost all their pokemon a badge during the debriefing? On the one hand, if they had made the right decisions, it'd still be reinforcing Surge's virtues, etc. But on the other hand, shit's just not fair sometimes. And on the other other hand he'd have to ask them to keep it on the hush-hush otherwise future people taking that test would be aware of it.

      I am aware of the reasoning that people should be left to think that they won't get the badge if they fail. Whether that should actually be the case or not is less clear.
      ```

      - u/Radix2309:
        ```
        If it's not the case, that quickly gets out. Especially since it is recorded.

        It is an assessment of skill. Why should they win for failing? Plus they cant really lie about pass fail conditions for a test like this.

  The rotom was a dead trainer's pokemon wasn't it? Failed to protect its trainer and is now protecting their corpse or maybe just so panicked that it's lashing out wildly against any potential threat. 

  Can pressure deprogram pokeball training over time?
  ```

  - u/Saffrin-chan:
    ```
    pokeball training would probably cover how the pokemon should act if their trainer dies, shouldn't it? Would be a bit of an oversight if surviving pokemon could attack people getting close to the body of it's trainer. Pokemon aren't even supposed to be trained to attack humans even if their trainer orders it(although as seen in this chapter it's not a regulation that's very followed), so it would be strange if a trained pokemon attacked another human without an order from their unconscious/dead trainer.

    Don't know if pressure could deprogram training, but there's probably not enough time over the course of a single event to do it, even if it's trainer was dead.
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Well Red makes his pokemon able to attack humans by tapping into a state of mind.   It's not too much of a stretch that a power which affects state if mind can have that effect on some pokemon.
      ```

      - u/Saffrin-chan:
        ```
        True! And since pressure affects humans differently depending on the person, it's not a stretch that some pokemon could be affected by having parts of their training supressed or their natural instincts brought forward. I'd have to reread the absol and Stormbringer chapters to remember what details we got about pressure affecting trained pokemon before.

  I don't see any theories as to how Blue's pidgeotto was able to identify rotom-frost as a threat at all. Foresight is an egg move for the pidgey line in the canon, so that seems unlikely. Has "Keen Eye" been buffed in this universe?

  Also, I was curious about how rotom's typing would be handled in TOoS. Looks like it does effectively "lose" its Ghost typing when inhabiting an appliance, as it no longer has the permeability(?) or surrealism, but can still use its Ghost type moves; just like the canon. Interesting.
  ```

  - u/AKAAkira:
    ```
    RE: pidgeotto identifying rotom - my first thought was that since scientific effects corresponding to Types are a must in this universe (e.g. the Flying "particle", and really the method(s) by which all moves work), it wouldn't be out of the question for some pokemon to have sensitivity via those kinds of interactions. For example, pidgeotto could have detected Electric-type "particles" off rotom, or its own Flying "particles" were shorted off near rotom's area. But this explanation may be falling into the trap of shoe-horning all unknown events into a single convenient phenomenon. And as a counter-example, it's not like pokemon don't identify danger by sight alone - they're trained to go tense at the sight of a Pokedoll, for instance, seen all way back in chapter two.

    RE: egg moves - in the games, egg moves couldn't be found on wild pokemon, but I think this fic is unlikely to have the same limitation. From a rational standpoint, you have to keep in mind that fact that all pokemon are born from eggs in the wild. It's probably only TM moves that are reserved for non-wild pokemon, though even that might have (or start to have) small exceptions if a trainer releases their pokemon back into that wild and they're successful in surviving and having offspring.

    RE: rotom's typing - I'm not sure if rotom lost its Ghost typing here. Blue mentions, when he first sees the rotom, that "It's a strange sensation, having knowledge blocked somewhere in his own head [...]", which seems to indicate surrealism. ~~Also, he notes after seeing the rotom use Blizzards and an unnamed electric attack that  "The overwhelming strength of his opponent is balanced a little by it not using only its most optimal attacks" - which reads to me like either the electric-type move or the Blizzard, one or the other, isn't benefiting from STAB.~~

    ~~Well, that's what it sounded like at first.~~ Thinking about it, it could instead mean the usage of Ice-type attacks that Snorlax is particularly effective at tanking against. And Blue did mention that this rotom was Ice type, as in the Pokemon type...but could possibly mean "Ice type", as in rotom's form...

    And now I'm wondering if Red should work on his theory of pokemon with more than two types by starting with rotoms.

    u/DaystarEld, can I ask you about this last one?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Blue did indeed mean most effective attack against Snorlax :)

      &#x200B;

      I'm interested in the answer to this, but I expect it's easy to rationalize it away as "egg moves are moves that pokemon need to become familiar with at a very early age that aren't exhibited in the wild, but need pokeball technology to train them" so basically a specialized TM.
      ```

      - u/AKAAkira:
        ```
        The first chapter had this passage: 

        > Red once explained for five minutes to Blue how a researcher in Johto discovered that, after breeding a slowbro and a bayleef, the baby chikorita that hatched was able to heal those around it: a power no other chikorita had ever dispalyed, but that the slowbro father had learned [...] [Blue] wasn't the least bit interested in the implication that pokemon retained some intuitive, genetic grasp of how to use abilities they didn't normally have

        So in this fic, egg moves don't need pokeball technology to train them, they're just moves a pokemon would not "normally" have, i.e. learn over the course of it regular growth (or have already learned by that point in time).
        ```
