  Bookmarked - interesting story idea, I'm excited to read further.

  If anyone isn't already familiar with mrphaeton, please read his Significant Digits. There are a number of HPMOR fan fictions, but none are quite as well-written and true in spirit to EY's work than Sig Digits. In Eliezer's own words, it is the "definitive" continuation fic. I would argue that Significant Digits surpasses the original fic in a number of ways, but most especially with world building. High recommend.

  So let's see what I've managed to figure out so far.

   * Strong AI is a thing, but is "like getting a checkers AI to play chess". Strong in unpredictable ways.

   * Most software is distributed, made up of smart contracts?

   * The realized have "magic", probably a factor of the aforementioned strong AI.
    * Reads like worm, called "conquest". Protagonist has no skills. AI magic a substitute for powers?

   * What is ikon?

    * Ikon is referenced as a car

    * "Ikon was live". ikon is referenced as software

    * ikon is an AI? For driving cars? Scope unclear, maybe everyone has a personal ikon.

    * ikon is a smart-contract distribution? Less narrativly-interesting then ikon being an AI. Toyota vets smart contracts, makes cars.

    Based on your thinking here, I think you're going to like where the story goes.

  I wanted to wait until I had a substantial amount up to link the story, but from now on I'll link each chapter from here.  If you'd like to discuss any of the past chapters, there are threads on /r/AiH:

  Here's the blurb for the story as a whole:

  *Nothing makes sense.  Sophia is trapped with her abusive family, inside of a corrupt town that's part of a rotten world, and things seem to get worse every day.  For every advance in robotics and transportation, there’s another war or another plague.  And she’s not sure how much more she can take.*

  *A world with a singleton wasn’t supposed to be this way.  When Ramanujan became the first artificial superintelligence, it was supposed to solve all problems or end the world or… something.  But there was neither apocalypse nor apotheosis.  God was born, looked upon creation, and went to sleep.*

  *Sophia is ready for a new world.  If she has to, she’ll make it herself.  One conquest at a time.*

  You posted about this on a Friday thread a few weeks ago, right? Because I definitely remember seeing this discussed.

  - u/mrphaethon:
    ```
    Not I. I'd be curious to read that, actually.
    ```

    - u/gbear605:
      ```
      Hmm, I just seemed to remember reading a worldbuilding thing with this very specific subject. Can't find it though.
      ```

        If you find it, let me know :-)
