  In the case of the Kobayashi Maru test, I think the "big picture" perspective would be to recognize that you're not actually a captain whose goal is to rescue people in the neutral zone; you're a cadet who is participating in a simulation as part of a Star Fleet examination and your goal is to showcase your potential as a commander.

  I once participated in a scavenger hunt where one of the location hints had an answer that was a fairly obvious bit of trivia about the town, and one answer that was "technically correct" and an obscure bit of knowledge that only a tiny number of people possessed.  I knew that the person who was running the scavenger hunt, and knew that they wouldn't design the scavenger hunt to have "trick answers" that required obscure bits of domain-specific knowledge that would only be known to a tiny handful of people, so I went with the "obvious" answer, correctly identified the location of the next clue, and our group went on our merry way.  In this case, I could have opted to be "technically correct," but the real test was not "identify the 'correct' answer to this trivia question," but "identify the location of the next clue."  Being "correct" doesn't always equate to "winning."  Context is important: Had I known the creator of the scavenger hunt to be the kind of person who *would* try to insert tricky answers intended to mislead participants, I would have adjusted my strategy and probably checked the "technically correct" location instead.

  The Kobayashi Maru is not a scenario so much as it is an examination of your abilities, and cheating the test is only a winning move if you think that cheating the test will impress the people who are administering the test.  In the case of the Kobayashi Maru, the point of the test is to see how people will respond in an "impossible" situation, and cheating the test might be a way to demonstrate the kind of outside-the-box thinking that the test proctors are looking for.

  Scotty's decision to cheat the test by exploiting the limitations of the simulation ends with the academy staff removing Scotty from command school and reassigning him to the engineering program.  This is what Scotty wanted all along, so he "wins," even though it might look like a failure to be removed from the command program.
  ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    As an additional detail, Scotty's is the only one where we get to 'see' them talking to him after the event.

    He admits freely that he 'cheated' by taking advantage of the fact that it was a simulation based on math and not reality.  He used an attack which hit the enemy ships where their shield bubbles overlap--in math terms, it should cause a catastrophic overload that destroys them all (what happens in the situation when he does it).  But it turns out, he knows an engineer actually *tested* this effect in reality and proved nothing happened.

    It's then they find out *HE* was the engineer that tested it, and then they straight up ask him if Engineering is a hobby and he wants to be a captain, or if he's being forced into Command school when he wants to be an Engineer.  Turns out, it's the latter, his family was pushing him for the prestigious spot, but he just wants to work with machines.   So they 'flunk' him for 'cheating', and as a consolation prize he gets to go to Engineering school.  He thanks the admiral, shakes his hand, and goes on his merry way to become the Scotty we know and love.

    Your version is correct, but its good to include this detail.  It was a very "rational" approach when he talks to them, admits to what he wants, and they come to a mutual understanding that benefits all parties... rather than just have one side 'trick' the other.

    Agreed, though if you do *not* have a clever way to cheat the test that also shows your outside the box thinking, then the best way to pass it is probably to just stay out of the thing entirely, like Sulu did. Which may not be amazingly creative or stand out, but at least shows you know your damn rulebook.

These are discussed at length in novels and video games and include mutiny of the crew over being asked to abandon civilians to die; violations of Starfleet policy regarding rendering of aid to distressed vessels; Klingon incursion into Federation territory responding to "provocation" by the Kobayashi Maru; or the weight on the cadet's conscience caused by refusing to render aid.

  > > Well no, Sulu is the only one who chooses incorrectly, he saves himself but the ship mutinies and would be discharged from service once he returned to base.

  > So the best possible outcome. One ship and crew and one man's career weighed against two ships at least and crews and the start of another war that could cost billions of lives on both sides.

    You're very clearly not an emergency responder, because what you're saying is complete bullshit. It's not your fault, because it's very prevalent, popularly believed bullshit that's instilled in everyone by Hollywood, but:

    > Self-sacrificing behavior is preferable to self-serving behavior overall, because the former is often required to reach a good solution in emergency situations

    The former is *emphatically forbidden* in emergency situations by all of our training and procedures.

    > should place yourself in danger as an emergency responder because that is the nature of the duty you have taken on, to risk yourself for others.

    As an emergency responder, the nature of the duty you have taken on is to *go the fuck home to your family* after the incident is over.

    It is not a firefighter's duty to risk being caught in a structural collapse for the sake of rescuing people any more than it is, for example, a postal worker's duty to risk dying in a mail truck accident for the sake of delivering your packages. Every activity in the world has risks; we do everything we can to mitigate those risks with safety equipment, safe work practices, etc; and every once in a while it isn't enough and some unavoidable freak accident occurs (but much more often, someone badly fucked up the safety practices). There is absolutely nothing romantic or heroic about this and it is absolutely not anyone's "duty" to get killed.

      The way this was taught to me was: "Don't make another victim."

      &#x200B;

      I think if I were teaching it, i'd use a video i saw a while back where a car had fallen off  a peer so a big crane was being used to lift the car out of the water. The crane tipped off the peer under the weight. So a larger crane was brought in. It lifted the car but when it went to recover the otehr crane it tipped off the peer under the load, and a third even bigger crane had to be used to lift the two cranes out of the water. If the cranes were people we'd call the first crane an "idiot" not a "hero".

          Doesn't actually matter. It'd be equally useful for illustrating the point it it were a stick-figure cartoon.

          edit:

          &#x200B;

           As a followup, the reasons it'd be useful as education material are:

          &#x200B;

          1. It is memorable. A lesson people forget is less useful than one they remember even if it's a made up story rather than a real account.
          2. It clearly shows the important point of the lesson. Unlike the example of a cop dying due to an unseen danger, which can be interpreted as "be prepared to die when rescuing people" the crane example clearly shows that attempting to save somone and failing puts other people (not just you) in grater danger as anyone responding after you now has to rescue you as well as the original victim. This can get them kileld trying to save you, and it can compromise their ability to save the original victim trying to save you as well. Which is the point of the lesson. And in a rational reconstruction would probably be the point of the Kobiashi Maru scenario. 
          3. It's not violent, or sexy so there is little risk of moral guardians deeming it unsuitable for any audience you may find yourself needed to educate about emergency preparedness.

    > In a real scenario, you will never *know* you are in a no-win situation until you die. You will not know that the Klingons will catch you, and you will not know that the KM's engines are crippled or that its crew are even still alive for you to rescue. You are not afforded the privilege of perfect knowledge.

    However, in a real scenario, you *do* know (or, at the very least, *it's extremely reasonable to assume*, given what your superiors have assigned you to do *literally at this very moment*) that the Klingons are patrolling the other side of the Neutral Zone and that the chance of being caught if you enter it is not negligible.

    > In a na[&iuml;]ve scenario rescuing the Kobayashi Maru is the right move, both as an individual choice and an iterated choice.

    I don't know much about *Star Trek*&mdash;but, [if I replace "Klingon Empire" with "North Korea", "Northern Cyprus", or "Israel"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demilitarized_zone), trespassing in an demilitarized zone to rescue another trespasser, with a non-negligible risk of being discovered by the country that's known to be (1) actively patrolling the other side of that zone just as I'm patrolling my own side and (2) very militarily aggressive and hostile toward my own country (Southern Cyprus, South Korea, or Lebanon), does not seem like a very smart decision. If going into the DMZ is assumed to be a coin flip between "save both people" and "lose both people (to prison, torture, and/or death) *and* damage the diplomatic standing of my country by being caught in the DMZ" (and that assumption definitely can be made *before* you enter the DMZ), refraining from going into the DMZ seems unarguably the best decision to me. If everybody went rescuing trespassers willy-nilly, these diplomatic incidents would regularly be escalated from few-person to many-person affairs.

      Sulu does the math in the book.  He flat out refuses to risk potentially millions of lives for the 300 or so crew of a single vessel, especially when it's possible said vessel is not real.  He orders that they send all possible information to Starfleet and let it be a diplomatic matter instead of a military one.

      It's something I always wondered when watching the movie.  Do most Starfleet captains just ignore treaties whenever they feel like it?  Or does the K.M. attempt to break them of this silliness?

        This too. Obviously the Klingons might want to start another war and this would be the perfect *casus belli*. Constant vigilance!

      This raises another out-of-box solution: call the Klingons and offer to trade the location of the ship (and possibly your own ship also and your crew into slavery) for the right to build a hotel on the Klingon homeworld and/or a whole bunch of credits.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:

        That sounds contrary to Federation directives, and honestly not like something the Klingons would accept. They're not Ferengi, they care about honour and war much more than they do about money.

    Except it's not metagaming.  He doesn't know the details going in, none of them do.  If you read the book, he is rather surprised *just how quickly* his simulation ends after he refuses to go in, because he *expected* that it would make him lose one way or another no matter what he chose.  He even specifically stated during the scenario that it was either a fake lure used by the Klingons or a real situation to be solved by diplomats, not military action.

    It's goal isn't to 'enforce humility'.  It's goal is to test the composure, will, leadership, and decision-making skills of the captain.  If you go by the book, it becomes progressively more difficult the more you fight against it--Scotty never 'won', he just broke each encounter until the program had to spawn in 20+ ships that all fired simultaneously to kill his ship before he could react (and he was already coming up with plans how to handle that as well).

    The naive approach is to just up and sacrifice yourself for no reason, rather than weighing the pros and cons to come up with a solution that does the most good overall.

    There's nothing *in* the neutral zone to attract tourists. Those "people" "sending" the distress call have no reason to be there or even want to be there. Given that a policy of having your patrols disturb their schedules to respond to distress calls would be incredibly easy to discover and exploit by an enemy who patrols the same border, the rational conclusion is that the Klingon set a trap.

    I strongly agree with this part. One of the reasons moral dilemmas in TV series are often unrealistic is that the story has to contrive to give the audience at least a general understanding of the benefits and costs of either choice, which is a luxury people making military or political decisions usually don't have.

    But that's even more reason to be conservative. Taking stupid risks gets you killed, and then you can't help people anymore because you're dead.

    You could say the same of Chekov self-destructing, since he won't *actually* die, not to mention the other two who outright cheat. As for the Klingon warships... yeah, IRL they would just be a possibility, not a certainty, depending on how tight you think they patrol the neutral zone. But you know they're warlike, bloodthirsty, and keen on starting trouble, so that possibility is very high anyway.

    Well, sure. But your statement that emergency responders should place themselves in danger to save others is false. They are generally trained to save themselves and anyone they can WITHOUT likely adding themselves to the casualty list.

    You're trained to make a mess smaller, not make yourself part of the mess for others to clean up. Your emphasis on "sacrifice" is no good.
