  Stolen from https://the-toast.net/2014/05/27/ayn-rands-harry-potter-sorcerers-stone/ with some weird added commentary about Jordan Peterson and Joe Rogan (???).

    Congratulations.  You've actually managed to make me feel sorry for Voldemort (as, if this were *really* written by Ayn Rand, that speech would have gone on for *days* before he was allowed to die).
    ```

    ```
    Ah I didn't realise that! Thanks for pointing it out. I'll still leave the post up in case anyone is interested, but hopefully they see your comment.

    Oh dear, this is a blatant rip off and all the additions are awful. Daniel Mallory Ortberg had no peer in this series.

  This is kinda gross and... only very remotely related to anything "supply-side"?

  I feel a little cheated.

    Makes fun of Ayn Rand for writing lengthy stories filled with strawmen by writing short stories filled with strawmen.

  This is the second HP fanfic I've read. The first being MOR. Actually I'm not interested in fanfic, but reading somebody thought stealing it is worthwhile, it intrigued me. That said, is it tradition for rationalist Harry to be insufferable little twit?

    ```
    In Harry Potter and the Natural 20, isekai protagonist Milo serves as the obligatory insufferable twit, while Harry is the suffering-him-anyway bystander he tries to convert.

    Seventh Horcrux taking asshole Harry to extremes and it loops back to being funny.

    Break the tradition!

    I'd say there's a subset of philosophers whose written fiction have issues. (Though some are worse than others. With the really bad ones, you can tell that each book is a metaphor for something, but you don't have the faintest idea what it is, unless you stumble across another author who wrote the same story, and did a better job or explained in the intro what the book was about.)

    ```
    There are not a whole lot of rationalist Harries that I'm aware of. Not even all that many rational ones, really.

    Though I do recommend some of the sequels/continuations of MoR, like Significant Digits.
    ```

  - u/Reply_or_Not:
    ```
    I read a Harry Potter/ warhammer 40k crossover, and Harry brings death to heretics, is that better than being a little twit?
    ```
