    **diffident**

    *adjective.*

    1. lacking confidence in one's own ability, worth, or fitness; timid; shy.
    2. restrained or reserved in manner, conduct, etc.
    3. *Archaic.* distrustful.

      Yes.  And 'diffidently' is the adverbial form.

After a moment he shook his head. "If there's a way to make this work I'm not seeing it," he said. "I wish you'd hooked it up back when I first asked, it would have avoided all this." He sighed. "Well, I can understand why you didn't trust me, I suppose. Anyway...I have a feeling like there's something I'm missing, but I can't figure out what it is. I'll keep thinking on it; maybe we can work something out. In the meantime, the best I can suggest is to go practice. If anything really bad happens, just call me and I'll run the body for you while we deal with it."

      You think only evil people do this? Have you met any mothers ever? All mothers are manipulative and trying to increase the boundaries of what they can decide for their children, *for their own good!!!*

      I'd probably prefer an upfront and clearly EldritchAbomination!Kurama over a Motherly!Kurama. It's just too mind-breakingly uncomfortable otherwise. Of course then there's [Sayuri](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4730390/1/Naruto-Genkyouien).

      I might have lost track a bit here,  but AFAICS knowledge granting ought to be doable.. but obviously modifying the brain creates such huge trust issues that yeah, it would be pretty irrational for Kurama to do so, even if it hugely increases Naruto's survivability.

      Of course, there's no guarantee he hasn't already done so (eg. preprogrammed parts of Naruto's brain so that he will 'pick up' the needed skills with unusual aptitude). The problem is more of saying things that invoke distrust.
      ```

      - u/JackStargazer:
        ```
        That was more in response to the *amazingly obvious* manipulation going on at the end there, where Level 3 Kurama fakes a pause of inspiration that he knows Level 2 Naruto will pick up on an question, priming him for later deception.

- u/XxChronOblivionxX:

  Welp, on the bright side, his combat potential just shot through the fucking roof.

  On the negative side, he now looks like a complete monster.

  This is why genies are dangerous.

  rescue?

  Also.....Kurama seems way too fucking nice, and it's honestly concerning me. I want to believe him when he says he only attacks places with build ups of malice (which is kind of canon, only for you to realize Konoha wasn't such a place, as it was Tobi that made him attack it anyway)  but I'm kinda concerned. What with the whole eldritch abomination thing he's got going. Is he nice now /u/eaglejarl? Is he??? T_T
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    > rescue

    Thank you, fixed.

    >  Is he nice now /u/eaglejarl[1] ? Is he??? T_T

    Well of *course* he's nice!  I mean, yes, he's a city-destroying elder demon, but look at how polite he's being, and how he just rebuilt Naruto into a massive inhuman combat monster.  I mean, sure, the fact that Naruto can't even stand up right now might be considered a drawback, but it's still awesome, right?  Right?!

    EDIT:
    >  he only attacks places with build ups of malice (which is kind of canon, only for you to realize Konoha wasn't such a place,

    Konoha is a ninja village.  Its entire reason for existing is to train mass murderers.  They have a department that is literally called "Torture and Interrogation".

      Of course! I mean, he only destroys *evil* cities anyways, so that's perfectly fine!

      How do we know he only destroys evil cities? Well, Kurama told us of course, silly, and why would he lie?
      ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Yes, but the Fox didn't attack Konoha due to those things, is what I'm saying. It attacked because Madara Uchiha hijacked it. Although, don't get me wrong, it would've probably attacked them anyway, considering they'd kept him locked up for almost a hundred years by this point.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        > Yes, but the Fox didn't attack Konoha due to those things, is what I'm saying. It attacked because Madara Uchiha hijacked it.

        Fair point. I'm going off book on that one though, because I think it's utter baloney that a human with spinny eyeballs could control the Fox. I'm also off book on how long he's been captured -- in my version, the Sage put the Beasts into jinchuuriki from the get-go.
        ```

        - u/Kishoto:
          ```
          Yea, that's fair. I started getting really annoyed with canon's treatment of the Sharingan. I mean, from inception, it seemed really OP already. Copying any ninjutsu, reading body movements at superhuman speed, casting genjutsu with a glance. But then they kept adding on more shit. Oh hey, I can trap anyone I want in a 3 day long torture fest, and I can shoot black flames that take 7 days to go away. Oh, and I can make a big ass, practically impenetrable suit of armor that also has weapons that are equally as good. Oh, I can sacrifice sight in a single eye. **And reverse my death, after it's already happened.**

          EDIT: Oh. And I can control any of the nine walking natural disasters of our world at any time. 

          Get fucked canon Sharingan.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            The copying ninjutsu thing and super-speed reading things were at least related. OP, but related and believable.  Everything from then on was just full-on crazy.  So, yeah, I'm with you.
            ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    Notice that bit at the end where Kurama convinces Naruto that all this could have been avoided if he just got permission to mess with Naruto's brain? He may be a lot nicer here but he's gone from "imprisoned and assumed evil" to "napping on a mountain with near unrestricted access on the horizon."

    He's probably not evil but that doesn't mean he isn't planning on restricting Naruto to weekend custody of his body.
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      > He's probably not evil but that doesn't mean he isn't planning on restricting Naruto to weekend custody of his body.

      I can promise you with complete sincerity that Kurama has no intention of setting up a situation where Naruto has weekend custody of his body.
      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        This is because Kurama is Really Niceâ„¢ and definitely doesn't want to take over Naruto's body indefinitely and without restriction.
        ```

        - u/eaglejarl:
          ```
          Exactly!
          ```

- u/Cariyaga:
  ```
  Ahhh, going that route as far as the tailed beasts go, huh? I've always found that one a lot more interesting than the whole demonspawn-bent-on-destroying-everyone thing that some fics go. ...well, at least, that's what Kurama wants us to think of him.
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    > well, at least, that's what Kurama wants us to think of him

    This is literally *always the answer ever.* /u/eaglejarl, you sick son of a bitch. I'm not trusting the Big Bad *this* time! [Never again!](http://i.imgur.com/CZkB7fO.png)

    Rats, I'd thought this was actually original.  Where else have you seen it?
    ```

    - u/Cariyaga:
      ```
      I can't say, exactly. I've read so many fics in my time that they all blur together. It IS a very interesting concept though, original or not, and I look forward to seeing what you do with it.
      ```

      Im fairly sure it at the very least was the case in "The Girl From Whirlpool".

        *sigh*

        Ah well.  I've never had an original idea before this, I don't see why it should start now.

        (Seriously, I haven't.  Every time I thought I had, it turned out someone else had done it years or decades earlier.  It's frustrating.)

          [Yup.](http://anathem.wikia.com/wiki/Lorite)

          >The basis of the Lorite order is Saunt Lora's Proposition which states that all possible ideas have already been found, in other words, there is nothing new to discover. The Proposition itself is considered to be the Last Idea, although after the death of Saunt Lora, one of her fids showed that her proposition had itself been expressed 4000 years earlier.
          ```

        - u/Kishoto:
          ```
          There's nothing new under the sun, as they say. It's about how we use the ingredients, not what they actually are (in most cases)
          ```

        - u/Cariyaga:
          ```
          Ah, don't feel bad for it. It's in how you put the disparate elements of a story together that makes it great, not that any one element is unique to it.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            It bothered me for years, but I've gotten over it.  At base, both creativity and success lie in execution, not in conception.
