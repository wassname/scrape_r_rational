  Some thoughts:

  * Fenn was my favourite character for the majority of the story and i'm terribly sad to see her go but, presuming she actually remains dead (at least for a reasonable portion of the story), i'm happy AW is willing to kill off major characters. I personally love the tension added to a story when there's a genuine risk of character death. 

  - I thought the break up scene was beautifully done; i was left with this kind of aching sense of loss. For me personally the death scene following right on top of that the chapter after didn't give me enough breathing room and meant Fenn's passing didn't hit as hard as perhaps i would have liked. I'm curious if others felt similarly because i predict i may have just been an outlier here.

  - I guess we're going to get an opportunity to see how Joon's developed as a person as we compare how he deals with the loss of Fenn versus how he handled Arthur's death. I wonder if he'll confront Bethel, seeing as her presence would have made Fenn's death less likely.

  - Fenn's death occuring immediately post-break up is no doubt going to give Amaryliss plenty of narrative theory thoughts to chew on.

  - Joon leveling up has just gotten a lot more dangerous. If he levels up post combat and amaryliss is incapacitated then he's in trouble.

  - Loved Valenica's mindgames with the fake breakdown; Devil & Demon Valencia is one of my very favourite parts of this story. I have a massive soft spot for Valencia the character too; the kind of naked vulnerability she showed when Joon was doubting her is very endearing. It's not hard for me to see how she's 'Joonbait'. 

  - There's a lot of appreciation on this subreddit for when a story goes the extra yard to make the worldbuilding or the plot especially real and true to life, and this story does that, but one of the ways it sets itself apart is how it puts this same attention to detail in making the characters real. One extremely innocuous example from the latest chapters: Fenn saying she may need to leave the group for a while, putting some physical space between her and Juniper, after therapy has broken down and the break up's in progress. The next day Joon narrates in passing that it looks like she decided to stay. 
  This kind of small detail makes everything so *real* to me. Like, most other stories would never have Fenn mention something like that to begin with unless it was set up for her *actually* leaving, yet that sequence of events is exactly the sort of thing someone might do during a break up - either overreact in the moment or really try to hammer in to the other person how you feel, wielding this big emotive club saying 'yes, i feel strongly enough about this to do *that*', but come the next day not actually follow through or even have ever been particularly likely to. The story is littered with details like this and in the same way that digressions about dragons effecting the commercial airline market make the *world feel real* it's these little character moments that make the *people feel real*.

    I really appreciated the breakup scene, too -- though I don't think I got hit with the sense of loss just then. I remember fixating on Fenn pouring her heart out, then inner monologue "I have so much I want to say... **I stayed silent.**" And my main emotional reaction to that was just frustration with Joon. I figured it'd play out and get resolved, comfortably, and probably soon.

    At the end of 118, that feeling of loss you mention - it caught up with me pretty hard.

    re:character death:

    There's basically no way Fenn is killed off for real: there are too many established methods of resurrection.

    Even if the poison genuinely soulkilled her, that just means Joon has to become a god and brute force her back to life.
    ```

    - u/i6i:
      ```
      It depends on whether or not the companion quest is marked as failed. If no then all this is is another 2 books looking for phoenix down. If yes then Fenn isn't coming back as anything other than a motivational hallucination until the final boss fight where she's going to be hopelessly underleveled  and confused about when Grak turned into an Ent and why Joon is now dating Doris fucking Finch.

      Yes, and to achieve this he'll go find a younger version of himself and offer a chance to meet Arthur, if he just goes and lives in this world called "Aerb" for a while. And later, he gives his younger self a nice backpack.

      I think the evidence in story points to it being more likely than not that Val was being genuine. Summarising that would be quite the endeavour. It's possible she wasn't being genuine, certainly.

  These chapters hit pretty hard, and were pretty sad.  I was especially struck by Valencia's comment that Fenn was the only party member - Jun included - who wouldn't be able to bring herself to kill Jun even to save the world, and how that contrasted with Jun's poison-treatment triage leaving Fenn for last.

  Kind of a depressing end for the woman who apparently valued Jun's life more than Jun himself did.
  ```

  - u/Alphanos:
    ```
    > Jun's poison-treatment triage leaving Fenn for last

    In fairness to Juniper's triage prioritization, after treating Solace, their healer, he seemed to have worked on each of them based in large part on the order in which they succumbed to the poison.  Fenn was the last one standing and fighting, so in combination with her luck, Juniper probably guessed that she had been the least-affected, and thus was in the least danger.

    In hindsight, this had already resulted in Fenn being the last one carried out of the danger zone, giving her potentially greater exposure, and Juniper did not take a moment to reconsider that.

    But yes, leaving Fenn for last in both the evacuation and the treatment does seem to contrast with her views.
    ```

      ```
      >he seemed to have worked on each of them based in large part on the order in which they succumbed to the poison

      That makes sense when you put it that way. I was somewhat upset with him for not working based on length of exposure, but the time it took them to collapse perhaps made more sense given what he knew.

    That's giving Val a bit too much credit.

    I could see if she helped arrange the breakup so that she could swoop in as the rebound.  I could see if she gave less attention to Fenn in the heat of combat because she doesn't like her so much.

    But it's way too much to think that she planned out her death via getting her opponents to do it 24 hours in advance.  It's just way too chaotic in a fight for her to try and rely on that.

      ...Or too little credit :)

      What exactly did Valencia see to know something was up? She seems to just blurt the warning out. Once she identifies it's poison, why does she only pass her crown to Juniper? During the group's preparations, why is she intent on downplaying the need to prepare for an attack?

      Hmm...  A poison that corrodes the soul... Sort of seems like the kind of thing Fallahtehr would've been interested in. O'kald probably just had some laying around though... Hey Valencia sure is being helpful, grabbing Amaryllis and handing her off to Juniper... Without going back to pick up Fenn...?

      Oh.

      >“For years,” Valencia said, “For years,” she said again, between breaths. “I was theirs for *years* and I don’t, I can’t.” Tears were streaming down her face.

      Maybe eating a thousand demons is a bad idea?  


      Edit:  
      From Chapter 102:

      > Even with a lesser devil like this one, it was sometimes hard to find herself in the mix. The devil was dead, taken apart into component pieces, but those pieces were a part of her, augmenting her thoughts and, to some extent, feelings. She had been working hard, with Mary’s help, both to become more of herself, so there was less for the devils to overwhelm, and to keep from reaching into that well of understanding just because it was there. She tried to think about the devils as voices, independent characters, but that wasn’t really true. They were dead, and she was simply using their skills or knowledge. It was easier to think of them as separate, so that she could say it was a demon telling her how to kill everyone in the room, rather than her own thought that she wouldn’t have had without the demon in her.
      ```

  - u/TwoxMachina:

    Hmm, I'm feeling something...

    Val ate over a thousand devils, I think she overloaded, and is now thinking like a devil.

    The devils orchestrated the breakup & then chose for Fenn to die.

    ```
    Or maybe the first time it triggered during the encounter and Joon failed to react to that, already pushed her past the point of no return?

    Luck isn't really well defined, so if we assume that it works by a principle of warning you when your worldline would collapse to the point of inevitable harm/death/other negative consequences, then at the point of it triggering they would be either soon nuked to oblivion (where she dies) or it would end up in an inevitable no-stops-pulled confrontation (looking at O'kald's tenacity I don't imagine they could have avoided this however they tried) where Fenn would end up getting neglected in triage due to the falling out or generally being to low on Joon's list of priorities (where she, again, dies). And hence the luck already did trigger back then, when Joon's decision to stay made this inevitable.

    Nothing concrete here to prop this up, given how luck is underexplained, but just some food for thought.

    I think Joon is generally held to expectations that are far from reasonable by this subreddit but this comment from him specifically did stand out to me as rather, uh, *dickish*.

    It was implied Grak had bonded with everyone except him (because Joon), so they all probably knew.

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        imo it's because he sees Grak as being hyper-masculine (because that's what dorfs are), and men don't have emotions. Therefore, Grak's past was not actually traumatic so it doesn't really matter if he brings it up.

- u/Argenteus_CG:
  ```
  Holy fuck, that got intense. Moreover, if this took more than five minutes, Fenn is in one of the hells (assuming the soul poison wasn't deep enough to destroy her soul entirely). Come to think of it, I'm rather unclear as to how the hells work. We know there are different hells, with the higher numbers being deeper and worse. But what determines which hell you go to? My prior assumption had been that you start off at the first hell, and every time you die you go a level lower, but that doesn't seem to be the case, looking at the details in these chapters regarding the hells.

  Regardless, given that Joon just saw recently how bad the hells really were through the infernoscope, it seems quite likely that Fenn's presence in the hells will be discussed. I can't see Joon leaving his ex girlfriend trapped in the hells. Valencia can make her time there more bearable, but not by that much. Joon's quest to destroy the hells may become quite a bit more urgent. Killing literally all of the demons and devils would be a start, but I'm not sure Valencia is up to that yet. If we've been told how many there are, I don't remember it, but it's got to be in the billions at least. A way to enter and leave hell would be an important step, but I'm not clear enough on the metaphysics of Aerb to even speculate as to whether that's possible.

  Well, I'll speculate a little. Valencia could act as a gateway between world, potentially. If her tendrils can grab onto the souls of non-infernals, she could pull them up. And we know she can avoid chewing them up, since she did so with the Locus. But the locus entered willingly, and the only evidence we have that she might be able to grab human souls is that one ability she has.

    I don't think Fenn's soul has gone to the hells. I think it was destroyed, like the souls that people of Aerb use as fuel.

    (I mean, it's *possible* that soul-destructions are a lie perpetuated by devils to manipulate mortals into generating billions of souls for them, and that in actuality all "destroyed" souls go to the deepest layers of hells where the infernoscopes can't see, but that's an entirely separate issue. As far as we know: soul destruction is possible, the poison appeared to be degrading souls, therefore Fenn's soul is likely destroyed.)

      ```
      It's possible her soul was destroyed, I'm not sure. But given the attention the hells have been given this set of chapters, it'd make narrative sense for Fenn to end up in the hells.

      It's not clear exactly how the poison works. I don't think it's just randomly destroying parts of the soul. My current hypothesis is that it worked by degrading the soul's conception of the body, given that when Joon looked in his soul, he saw the body there damaged.

        There are two souls, or two parts to the soul, I'm not sure which.  From chapter 67: 

        > “The term ‘soul’ is imprecise,” said Fallatehr. “You likely think of it as a small white thing pulled from the heart or head after death?” He gestured first at his temple, then at his chest. “That is the anima exa, a physical manifestation of the soul, unique to the mortal species, but not synonymous with the anima ipsa.”
        > 
        > “But the soul can be extinguished,” I said. “And as far as I can tell, that has no bearing on the bones themselves.”
        > 
        > “The anima exa can be extinguished,” said Fallatehr. “And in fact, nothing in the world can prevent that, so far as is known to me. That has little bearing on the anima ipsa.”
        > 
        > I frowned at that. “Naively, that doesn’t make sense. You’re saying that the soul continues to exist in the bones, regardless of whether someone goes to hell?”
        > 
        > “No,” said Fallatehr. “What I am saying is that by every method I have been able to use, the soul continues to be accessible well after death, even for those confirmed by infernoscope to have passed into the afterlife.”
        > 
        > I heard movement from behind me. “If that were true --” Amaryllis began.
        > 
        > “It is,” said Fallatehr.
        > 
        > “There would be metaphysical implications of that,” said Amaryllis. “If the souls of those in hell could be manipulated by means on Aerb we --”
        > 
        > “They cannot,” said Fallatehr.
        > 
        > “Why not?” asked Amaryllis.
        > 
        > “The principle of planar disjunction,” said Fallatehr. “It was the talk of the Guild of the Essential Soul, prior to the subjugation and death of ninety percent of its members when Manifest’s exclusion zone was created.” He seemed slightly wistful for a moment. “Obviously I had no ability to conduct novel research on planar disjunction from within Amoureux, and I was not allowed the courtesy of taking a copy of the relevant studies into the penitentiary, but all available evidence pointed to the fact that the soul was, in fact, incapable of crossing the planar boundary.” He waved his hand. “Much of this is tangential to the subject at hand.”
        > 
        > “Har har,” I said, raising my deformed hand slightly.
        > 
        > “We might think of the bones as intermediaries,” said Fallatehr. “If the soul is a complicated book of exceptional length, the bones are men who study that book and give answers to those who seek them. Each has a deep connection to the soul, and is conversant on its own area.”
        > 
        > “But when you burn a bone, you affect the soul,” I said. “So it wouldn’t seem like a very good metaphor to me.”
        > 
        > “Metaphors are rarely good,” said Fallatehr with a shrug. “We -- I say we, but there are by your accounting few left alive who might have given me a proper conversation on the subject -- don’t understand precisely what happens when bone magic is used. It appears to affect both donor and recipient at the level of the soul, with other effects as a result of that, but the actual mechanism is opaque, despite the numerous tests we’ve done.”

        It's always seemed to me that the "anima exa" is the part that gets collected and used for fueling motorcycles and the like, and the "anima ipsa" is the part that goes to the hells.  Or that, because the "soul" can't cross planar boundaries, maybe the anima ipsa already exists on another plane.
        ```

        - u/LupoCani:
          ```
          I think that's backwards.

          The Anima Exa is what exits the body, and is burnt in generators unless it crosses into the hells.

          The Anima Ipsa remains in the body, fuelling bone magic and related phenomena, apparently forever.

    My assumption is that the hell you get reincarnated to corresponds to how evil or good you are before you die.

    A highly good person like Abswifth would end up on the first or second level, while an extraordinarily evil person would end up in the 4000+.

    It works on a cosmological level to encourage people to be good, and help curb the idea that "I'd go to hell anyways" by there always being an even lower hell to go to.
    ```

    - u/Argenteus_CG:
      ```
      I thought about addressing this idea, but I didn't end up doing it. I don't think this is the case, for various reasons:

      1. Aerb doesn't seem like that type of world to me, where you get something that in some way correlates with what you deserve, even if in reality nobody deserves hell. Aerb, while not universally shitty, just doesn't seem to be the sort of place with even that level of fairness.

      2. This implies a fundamentally true "Good" and "Evil" baked into the universe. There is admittedly some evidence for this, given the effect in the white tower, but I'm not sure we can conclude yet that this is a universal force rather than a mental effect that uses one particular person's form of morality. That said, a determinant for who goes to hell based on a morality that Joon or most readers wouldn't agree with, for example with soul magic being inherently evil like the tower seemed to think, is probably the most interesting form of a morality based hell sorting. I've toyed with the idea of a campaign based on that idea in the past, where good and evil are fundamental forces of the universe but don't necessarily align with what I or the players see as right and wrong.

      3. Mary said that the first few levels of hell weren't much worse than the island the story started on. It seems worth living under those conditions. People tend to think of themselves as good, so if there was the belief that if you're a good person you don't suffer that much, I'm not sure soul burning would be as universally considered the right thing to do as it is; even shitty people would rationalize why they're actually a good person and would be on one of the first levels.

  OK so I have a question about the nature of threat confrontation. Heshnel said after Uther went missing, his followers stopped the rising threats but only after heavy losses. But how heavy are we talking? It sounded like the group facing the threats were small, powerful groups of Uther's people so the losses would be relatively small too. Dozens, maybe low hundreds in terms of lost members or family/loved ones but nothing in the grand scheme of things right?

  Yet if the scale and number of threats are really that bad, shouldn't this be a unified, planet-wide effort with every major government setting things aside to deal with this rather than a small group? Joon and Uther are powerful, but not as powerful as an entire organization since individual power can only go so far. They've very nearly lost fights when they go up against other small groups like this one, Larkspur, the gold mage etc. Imagine if they were facing 20 Bellads, 50 mages of all types with a support staff of hundreds, there'd be no winning in a fight there, only retreat. Equally, such a large force should do better against the rising threats. 

  The thing is, the manner of threats Joon and Uther typically face are like DND party sized things, enemy parties, BBEG, giant monsters, etc, never entire militaries because those types of confrontations are narratively difficult and less dramatic and personal than the party sized stuff. But if you were optimally trying to face some insane apocalyptic threat, why throw dozens at it and hope when you could throw thousands? I imagine an international special forces organization with a strength in the tens of thousands should be created to deal with this stuff.

      A fair point, but the nature of threats in this universe are a lot more concrete and visceral than our real world problems. People can look at the scientific consensus and bury their heads in the sand, they cannot look at the Apocalypse Demon or Ice Mages or Void Beasts and do the same.

    The problem with this logic is that all professions, mages especially seem to have quadratic power and versatility.  When you lose people at the top in this universe, you are losing irreplaceable contributions to art, science, education, and the military.  50 decent tattoo mages together could make an awful lot of fireballs, which would make them a great fighting force, but it's possible that  none of them could make a blast that literally ages you.  Vervain dying likely meant that thousands of new breeds of flowers never grew.  Diseases might go uncured, etc.

    Similarly, throwing thousands at certain threats might be meaningless.
    ```

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:

      People like Vervain and the rest of Uther's knights were probably unique in the same way Uther was since they gained power proportional to him. But guys like Everett? He isn't one of a kind. He could be a fantastically intelligent and talented individual, but those kinds of people are commonplace enough even in our world. Even if he were the 1 in a million type, there'd be 17,000 others like him. 

      Skill, intelligence and talent can't be as irreplaceable as your making it out to be, it doesn't make sense for it to be that unique a commodity. 

      Do you mean that because certain threats aren't threats that can be physically confronted with an army? Like a guy in a room? Or do you mean meaningless because the loss of so much high level talent would make it Pyrrhic?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Sorry I was unclear.  A couple points:

        \- Everett was one of Uther's Knights, this is mentioned a couple places.  

        \- Furthermore, Everett discovered a form of immortality with some limits; if he wasn't exceptional there would be an increasing number of skin mages using it.  Hell, a lot of people would become skin mages if there's a chance at immortality.  17k people a generation over 20 generations would mean that there would be 340k immortal skin wizards; far more if you count the fact that population is slowly declining and used to be 20 billion.  It's improbable that they could keep a secret that big.  

        Fallatehr studied the soul for centuries, and only made it up to 180 skill.  Dwarves and Humans are at least 2/5ths, probably more, of the total population.  Members of the shorter lived races wouldn't have the opportunity, and Fenn said most elves would make shit scientists.  Juniper is a mage of "some skill" at a paltry 24.  Fenn was the best Archer in a major city with a handicap at around 50 (I believe).

        I think a reasonable conclusion is that gaining power isn't very easy for NPCs on Aerb.  If that's true, than 1 in a million is probably too low a guess on their relative rarity.  1 in 100 million might be closer, in which case you're talking about a relatively close knit community of several hundred to a few thousand.  Deaths would be felt intensely.

        \- If top tier talent is very rare, then you lose a couple things.  You lose training, combine that with a declining population, and the bench of top tier talent is probably much more shallow than when Arthur left for good.  With population decline, major events, and exclusions, they've proabably lost more than 1/4 of their pool.

        \- Additionally, you lose an economic incentive to research top tier magic. Making a cheap password locked tattoo and selling the plans would probably make more money than researching a Gem magic spell that had 100 times more dense particles but required 10 times the mental fortitude.  However, the dense beams would make it easier to understand particle physics.

        \- Militarily there might be threats that are too esoteric to defeat with thousands of mooks or even an army of low level wizards.  An army of creatures made entirely of energy; fifth dimensional invaders; the soul magic version of grey goo; creatures made out of the void; wizards that could summon antimatter....  Only the first and the last could be countered with an army of low level wizards (including revision mages), and the last it would be a roll of the dice.
        ```

        - u/CaptainMcSmash:
          ```
          Woops.

          Anyway, everything you're saying about the rarity of talent seems right, the lack of tens of thousands of powerful people running around is evidence enough. But that makes no sense to me. 

          Here's my model of how the universe operates; presumably the people of Aerb follow a bell curve of talent and skill similar to our own. People like Fallatehr or Everett (But not quite Everett since he has that insurmountable knack bonus) are at the extreme end of the curve right? Let's go with the 1 in 100 million number, that should still mean there should be more people a step below them that are 1 in 90 million. There should be people half as good but far more common since the relationship between skill and talent and occurrence isn't linear, i.e there should be far more than double the number of people half as good. 

          And this is what I mean by throwing thousands. Throwing thousands of nameless mooks and redshirts against those types of enemies might literally accomplish nothing, but a force of even hundreds of people almost as good as the absolute top tier should be far more powerful than that small group of top tier. 

          For extreme talent like Fallatehr to exist and to not have anyone appreciably near them in skill would mean the bell curve must be heavily skewed towards the middle with Fal and pals being extreme statistical anomalies, and that makes no sense to me. For talent to be *this* unique, it tells me there must be some kind of meta that arbitrarily limits the number of powerful people for narrative reasons. I know there's Uther the Chosen One, but ordinary powerful people managed to put down the remaining threats when he left, albeit at great cost. 

          This model is probably fundamentally wrong somehow, but I feel like the people of Aerb should have these threats in the bag. Half a dozen world ending threats have been mentioned, but even if there were a hundred, with 17 billion people working the problem, I can't see how they lose when considering the talent they should have. 

          In one story popular on this sub, Mother of Learning, one of the reasons for why powerful individuals aren't more common is because the people at the top tend to hoard their lore rather than sharing it and teaching capable people freely. There's nothing special keeping the number of powerful individuals down except societal reasons. I wonder if a similar principle is at play in this story.

          Finally, I feel like the response to these threats are woefully inadequate and a consequence of the nature of threats on Aerb. There's no doubt in my mind that the nations of Aerb if they really tried could deal with many of the exclusion zones themselves, but simply don't try because the threats are bottled up, not pressing and would be too costly to attempt. I don't understand the blaise nature of governments when there's literally only 2 years left in the library. It's like their all just waiting for someone else to fix their problems.

            ```
            I've typed and rewritten this post a couple of times; it's a good thinking exercise.  

            First off I think we have to assume that most of the threats mentioned are so esoteric, throwing waves of mooks at them would be useless.  In many cases, it could make the threat worse, like Manifest or the Necrotic Zone.  That said, artillery probably does exist, and many of the various exclusions could probably be flattened.  Delores Finch or Manifest are prime examples.

            What you're saying makes sense; the hex is huge with a lot of diversity.  Land that has supported 20 billion people and now has 5 billion people should have a lot of resources to throw at any problem; especially since it's relatively industrialized.  Why does Aerb suck at producing high powered individuals when the potential is there?  I can think of a couple answers, but I'm not super-convinced by them.

            \- Arthur had a completely different mode of thinking.  If you read old fantasy, *The Dragon and the George* has several examples of puzzles that a Medieval knight would find impossible to solve just because they grew up to become a Medieval knight.  When they lost Arthur (and Vervain), they didn't just lose his power, they lost his ability to unconventionally solve problems and his metagaming ability.  They had to do things the stupid power heavy way.

            \- Power comes from research, research comes from centers of learning, and centers of learning come from areas of high population.  But too much power means an exclusion.  It could be that every time there's a Silicon Valley of Aerb, someone invents an exclusion worthy magic.  The exclusion worthy magic has probably killed most of the city, thus preventing a lot of people from reaching their full power.  We know this happened to Pendelham (city of flesh), Silmar (necrotic field city), and Lankwon (capital of the Second Empire).

            \- Researchers can't stand on the shoulders of giants, because the DM imprisons those giants.  6 of the 13 Horrors to slay seem to be people who researched new magics.

            \- Almost no one else in the world actually gets to increase their primary stats.

            \- Investiture rules keep powerful people from getting entads that would make them Epic.  And a bunch of powerful relics are wasted on rich idiots.

            \- We're underestimating the skill of the party *and their enemies*, and it's throwing off how we see skill distribution.  During the Fallatehr section, Amaryllis described herself as fighting like a seasoned fighter of the pits; essentially a professional athlete.  I did a bunch of research here, but it looks like just playing in the top tier leagues puts you at somewhere between 1:80k and 1:100k.  So two adventures ago there should be something like 50,000 people that could compete with Amaryllis physically.  I think it's implied that Joon is a better fighter.  At the same time Joon is a better bone mage than a certified one.   There are an average of 290 doctors per 100k people in OECD countries.  That puts Juniper midstory at 1:34m.  The math gets more complicated if you split the doctors up between bone mages and blood mages.  Assuming similar proficiencies with gem and blood magic and by midstory, Joon is somewhere in the magnitude of 1 in 10 billion by the end of their third adventure.  I only mention this because fighting+bone+blood+soul have synergies together.  This fits with Solace having a 1 in 5 billion power.  

            Pallida is a Renacim fighter good enough to stay in the fight with Joon.  In Vallencia's chapter she says that there are only about 20,000 Renacim in the world.  If the Renacim have the normal distribution of professions (which they probably don't to be honest), and Pallida is as good as a veteran pit fighter she would be at least a 1 in 25b individual.

            My point here is that, the narrative has been dealing with the high ends of the bell curve since relatively early on; and right now the characters are on the very extreme ends.  (My math is real shaky here) So right now the characters are somewhere between 6 and 7  sigma; going up the bell curve means that guys the tier below tor even two tiers heir power are still pretty rare. 

            It's been a long time since I've taken stats, so correct me if any of this is off.

              God this has taken like an hour to compose. 

              Man I must look like an idiot, I keep getting the details wrong. I could've sworn I read there were 17 billion people on Aerb. I'm digressing but this is interesting me, how'd they lose 15 billion in 500 years? I got the impression exclusion zones were relatively small, the size of a city and the surrounding area, a few thousand square kilometers maybe. Even if all 50 of them (I hope this number isn't wrong too) happened to mega metropolises like New York, that's still only half a billion and that's assuming everyone caught inside the exclusion zone is doomed and none escape. 

              What kind of events are happening to cause 15 billion in deaths over that time period? That's insane, I'm now wondering why the people on this planet aren't more traumatized. This universe is worse than Warhammer 40k. It'd be like more than 3 WW2's worth of deaths happening every year. That first year alone, presuming they have a birth rate even half our own of 19 per 1000, they'd have to lose 190 million people just to keep the population stable. That's mindbending, what the actual fuck is happening there? 

              Your point about research makes me wonder if that could be the eventual fate of all schools of magic. Tattoo magic users develop it too far, DM says OP and excludes it. 

              Anyway I like all your points since they all go some way to explaining away the lack of powerful individuals, but just not enough in my eyes to account for the numbers we're seeing. 

              Your final point on the statistics of powerful individuals is the most convincing if its right, it does balance what we're seeing with the numbers, but I'm not sure it is. 

              A number of counterpoints:

              - I hope this isn't wrong too, but I thought no one other than Uther and Joon multiclass into multiple magic schools, everyone else just specializes in their school or build. This means you can't extrapolate the power of his enemies/companions with a straight multiplication of the odds (I'm presuming this is how you got the 1 in 5 billion number with Solace since measuring her power by saying she is the last druid left alive doesn't make sense). If Joon is 1:10bn and he is facing a velocity mage that's a massive threat, you couldn't accurately say that threat is 1:100m or 10m right? 

              - The measurement of power and talent also can't just be a straight multiplication of the odds, after all, you wouldn't say a proficient fighter-bone mage would be 290x more powerful than a fighter or a bone mage 290x weaker than a fighter. It'd be like judging the skill or talent of a high level sous chef by comparing the odds of him to a Olympian neurosurgeon. 

              - The pressures and motivations on Aerb are vastly different and combat applicable skills would be in far greater demand than here on Earth. Not many people, relatively, are needed or want to grow up to be professional athletes or soldiers. This isn't true for Aerb, there is a pressing need for combat capable people and likely much higher stats. 

              - If Joon is 1:10bn, and the people a tier below him are 1 standard deviation down, there'd be 500 of them roughly, 5000 roughly for 2. 5000 is around the lower end of the number I had in mind of powerful individuals, but it still sounds like enough to deal with 50 threats if they are almost as powerful as Joon, as they collectively would necessarily have near mastery in every school of magic, access to extremely high level entads and resources. This feeds into my next point. 

              - In terms of power on Aerb, there are diminishing returns as you go up the bell curve. The difference between 6.46 and 6.8σ is an order of magnitude, but that doesn't mean each order of magnitude translates to a 10x increase in power. Even towards the end of Uther's journey where he was arguably the most powerful individual on the planet. Falling and hitting something could kill him. If you placed Joon and his party up against 5000 people 2 sigmas below them, they'd lose, period. Joon might be able to do a few things that group couldn't do, but the worlds greatest swordsman can't beat 700 decent ones. 

              Two of the arguments I can think of against a group of powerful but not absolute masters not being able to face some of the exclusions that explain some of it:

              - Certain magics, even at mastery level, are of no use against certain exclusions

              - Absolute mastery or skill past an extremely high threshold is inherently necessary for even basic survival against certain exclusions and near mastery, regardless of quantity won't help.

              Also, what do you think of Doris Finch, how would you deal with her? She seems like one of the more easier ones to deal with.
              ```

              - u/None:
                ```
                There were 20 billion under Uther; 5 billion presently.  Major invasions like the Ice Wizards and Apocalypse Demon could easily kill some.  Prophylactics, industrialization, and genetically incompatible interspecies marriage could lead to 500 years of sub-replacement fertility.  Just 200 years (10 generations) of a global average of 1.8 kids per women would lead to 7 billion people on the world; unless I was reading the calculator wrong.  That's actually a pretty common birthrate in our world (the US doesn't have positive population growth without immigration).  Amaryllis does mention prophylactics in particular.  The exclusions probably get too much credit.

                The reason I mentioned Solace in general is the fact that she's a druid got the response “How much raw power is your side of the table packing?”  However, that makes your point even more valid; if druids were so powerful, and they are, how could the second empire exterminate them?

                And while I agree that a straight multiplication of rarity, the powers synergize pretty neatly.  Joon can pump speed, strength, and vitality by draining blood and bones, and then replace those bones with soul magic.  And heal himself.  It's not a perfect translation, but there is a noticeable correlation between dual classing in this case and power.

                So I think we're nearing a point of agreement; which is that this system is heavily titled more towards offense than defense.  There are so many avenues of attack that defense is very hard, and offense is very easy. Alpha strikes become hugely important.

                So, to answer your original question about why it was so hard; Uther's minions were playing constant defense for threats that came out of the woodwork.

                And while I think you're right that increasing skills has diminishing returns, it's not an exponential curve.  The reason I see is virtues like Bladebound.  Some virtues seem really powerful, like soul sight; it's not just increasing your combat ability, it's also increasing your ability to perceive, prevent, and protect against alpha strikes.  (Which gets to another point of agreement; there are threats that you could never see without soul sight.)  It's probable that without these virtues, you don't survive certain threats.

                One more tangentially related point; Uther's minions were also losing magic items as this was going on.  His greed heirs were taking stuff.



                As for Doris Finch:  a government could probably repeatedly void bomb the area, hire a dragon to raze the area, starve the area, etc.  The easiest way for the party would probably be creating a soul virus.  Assuming that she uses soul magic somehow, alter two of her so that the alteration would make her value the mission of exterminating non-altered Doris Finch, and hate herself in general.  As part of her programming, she would reinforce her own programming before it could fade.  Once all the non-altered ones are dead, the remainder have a kool aid party.  You wouldn't even have to alter that many values to do it.

            >For extreme talent like Fallatehr to exist and to not have anyone appreciably near them in skill would mean the bell curve must be heavily skewed towards the middle with Fal and pals being extreme statistical anomalies, and that makes no sense to me. For talent to be this unique, it tells me there must be some kind of meta that arbitrarily limits the number of powerful people for narrative reasons. 

            Bad example. Soul mages were specifically hunted down, and soul magery was outlawed. Therefore, if any other soul mages of similar tier existed, *they would hide their existence*. In fact, since magic exists to *test* for their abilities, they might want to fake their deaths to stop (well, reduce) people from looking for them!

            A more convenient explanation would be Fallatehr's prison, which makes him unique because the *entad* is unique - it traps him (and therefore likely stops him from faking his death+disappearing), but also protects him and makes faking his death unnecessary. Thus, he's the "only" amazing soul mage alive. 

            > This model is probably fundamentally wrong somehow, but I feel like the people of Aerb should have these threats in the bag. Half a dozen world ending threats have been mentioned, but even if there were a hundred, with 17 billion people working the problem, I can't see how they lose when considering the talent they should have. 

            "World-ending problems" are, by definition, problems that specifically can't be feasibly solved. That is not the same category as "major problems". Maybe there *are* more top-tier mages, they're just tied up in major-but-brute-forcable problems.

    I think you're probably right.

    A couple of chapterdumps ago I posted about the degree to which Juniper has been neglecting Grak. The next update included Joon making a more serious effort to connect with Grak, *but*...

    I guess I'll back up and say first, I have to agree with the Val-did-this camp as far as the breakup and Fenn's death.

    >I need to learn and grow on my own,” said Val. “And it’s too easy to talk when there’s a devil to draw on.”
    >“Too easy?” I asked.
    >“Too easy and too hard,” said Val. She flopped backward on the bed and stared up at the ceiling. “It’s easy to see the things that I could say to get my way, there are memories that I can reach to when I don’t know something, but the devils …” She waved her hands helplessly in the air above her, which might have been a funny visual if she didn’t seem so distraught.

    ...

    >“I would share you with Fenn, or be your secret,” said Val. She stopped, with confusion crossing her face. “No, that’s --” She looked at me. “I’m relying on the devil too much, letting it guide my path, that would have worked, but it’s not me. Amaryllis explained the, the biology, I know how, it just seems so gross.” She dropped her pose and looked at her hands. She looked up at me. “This is what I think I was trying to say.”

    Val loves Juniper. Val wants Juniper. Val wants Juniper to be happy. Val -- who in many ways is still a child--  knows for a fact, via devil juju, that she could use her talents make Juniper happier than Fenn *ever* could. The closest thing to an ethics class she ever had was reading *Harry Potter.*

    I think Val did it, but I don't think Val is at fault. She is at the mercy of forces she cannot understand or control, and has been failed badly by the authority figures in her life.

    So, about Grak. These chapters made me realize that Juniper has been doing the same thing to the rest of the party, too. Only Amaryllis' quests have been prioritized, ostensibly because gathering the resources and power of Uther's bloodline should make the rest more doable, but... what has he really tried? 

    Solace was polite about the fact that Juniper has been ignoring the Locus. Joon even feels kinda bad about it. But the reason he went to hang out with the Locus was the breakup.

    Juniper is selfish, but doesn't want to think of himself as a selfish person. Maybe Fenn's death will help him realize that he could have been pursuing her side quests, *helping* her the way she has helped him from day 1 instead of just accepting the assumption that he's the most important person in the universe. I don't know if that can happen as long as Val is nearby and continues to have the same values.

    If Val is going to make a play to wrest control of the party from Amaryllis, Grak's life may be in imminent danger.

      Is he? He strikes me more as apathetic, without any coherent long term personal goal he is pursuing (it used to be the accumulation of power, but that stopped after he soul edited himself). It looks like he seems to be mostly following short term pressures to avoid bad events, for example their current quest line got started because they were worried about the dream skewered accidentally saying 'Shia LaBeouf'. Before that they needed the time chamber to get Solace back faster in order to save the locus, before that they needed to a soul mage to save Juniper who burnt through his own bones, before that they needed a cure for rat rot for Amaryllis, before that they needed to save Amaryllis from a gold mage, before that it was acquire Amaryllis's artefacts (which is the last time the parties main activities have been directed at a coherent long term goal).

      To me it looks like Juniper will go to extraordinary lengths to protect his friends but not do much to advance their, or his, position.

  ```

  - u/ivory12:
    ```
    I thought Val was a terrible relationship counselor. She had a clear conflict of interest and didn't facilitate well at all. A lot of her arbitration was towards more escalation and she really policed the conversation in ways that just led to more conflict without resolving the extant conflict. She also kept inserting her interpretations of either of the two as the last word, which I found grating even just reading, but I hate that sort of serene psychoanalysis in real life and I think that bled over there. Val did a lot to raise and identify problems in their communication; she did very little of the actual, necessary therapeutic work identifying what steps they could take to *fix* those problems.

    I also thought she was way off base trying to impose her ideal relationship on Fenn/June with that "you don't make each other better" garbage. Yes, June may not be the same person he thinks of his ideal self as. That doesn't make who he actually is incompatible with Fenn as she is and wants to be and it doesn't mean their relationship is a net negative.

    All that said, I found the breakup part very believable. The way they never really talked about the letters and their emotional ramifications has been a red flag for a while, looking in from our outside PoV. On the other hand, conservation of narrative means we don't see every minutiae of their relationship or even every "big" conversation. I just found Val's social-fu lacking: if Val possessed the otherworldly social acumen needed to make such fine-grained insights about them she should also have been able to shepherd the relationship back to more stable ground. Instead she shattered it. The lines about devils not knowing how to build, only break, and being disposed to only tear down, I just didn't find persuasive enough.

    e: so I guess in conclusion you can put me in the "Val sabotaged things" camp and also that that chapter really hurt to read for someone who ships Fenn/June (even if Best Girl was becoming a bit of a weeb).

        ```
        As to Hanlon's, yeah, but either malice or stupidity I still see it as her fault. It's tough to watch June just take Valencia's words as the gospel. He does a bit of token hedging with

        >“You said that it takes an act of will to recognize that the preferred suggestions presented by your borrowed skillset might have moral consequences,” I said. “Even if there aren’t side effects, you’re still expending mental effort, and if you get worn down, the devil’s biases will start to come through more.”

        But he never moves from that to questioning her conclusions. C'mon, June, you should be questioning any and all of the advice she gives when she's spent several hours nonstop freebasing devil brainjuice.

      Why blame Val for Fenn's choice? If you think Fenn should have stayed with Joon, wasn't that Fenn's fault?

      ```

      - u/ivory12:
        ```
        Fair warning, this is probably not worth the read. I'm in paper-writing mode and it's really showing, I think, but anything to avoid thinking about my deadlines for a bit.

        I do think Fenn and June could have made it work. I also agree that ultimately it was Fenn's choice. I blame Val for her stage-setting and for the way she framed their relationship as an overall bad thing and not only unworkable but not worth working *at.*

        Unlike teaching, when it comes to real behavioural change I don't believe the Socratic method is effective. It's not enough for the therapist to lead the patient around in circles with insightful questions; especially not when it's couples counselling. Behavioural therapy has to take steps towards modifying that behaviour. Fenn and June weren't in that room to talk about their feelings and their deep-seated Oedipal complexes; they needed direction just as a much as they needed to be heard by each other.

        The first step in achieving any goal is figuring out what that goal is. The first step in problem in problem solving is, perhaps not surprisingly, quite similar: identifying its specifics. Val did this really well, such as when it came to things like Fenn and June's systems of thinking and how they communicated.

        However, it's not enough just to raise a problem as a therapist. Val consistently did two things that really bothered me. One, she really did very little to offer *positive* feedback. Val picked out a bunch of June and Fenn's problems, but she didn't do much prescriptive work in terms of what they could do to improve, marginalize, or diminish those problems. Second, she had a pessimistic outlook on the relationship and I think it really coloured the way she led the discussion. Take this passage, for example:

        >“It’s deeper than that,” said Valencia. “There are disconnects between the two of you, both in terms of who you are, who you think you are, and who you think the other is. Those are the things that we need to very delicately reconcile.”

        >“Very delicately … because otherwise we’d fall out of love?” asked Fenn.

        >“One or the other would, yes, or neither would, but the relationship wouldn’t be salvageable,” said Valencia. “This is the reason I thought it would probably take a few hours of discussion. It would be better to resolve things over the course of weeks or months, a little bit at a time, but the problems between the two of you are already interfering with our ability to function as a group.”

        As a glimpse into Val's thoughts, this shows both that Fenn/June comes second to group cohesion in terms of her priorities and also that Val is capable of incredible leaps of logic. Also, and most importantly, she appears to believe that June and Fenn are fundamentally incompatible. I don't think it's a huge stretch to say she walked into that room poisoned against the very idea of Fenn/June.

        I didn't expect the therapy conversation to magically fix all their problems. I did expect that Val, capable of determining that the relationship "wouldn't be salvageable" (is she a precog, now?), would also be capable of guiding the conversation in such a way as to have Fenn and June leave aware of their problems and working to bridge those "disconnects" having slightly "kissed and made up." Instead they left with their relationship over.

        Maybe it's just my inability to appreciate how fundamentally capital-E Evil inhabitants of the hells are and the strange way their social skills skew away from doing anything positive. But they're also capable of perfectly modelling good behaviour and are perfect actors; it seems odd to me that Val doesn't have the toolkit, even if it's a warped, abstracted idea of it, to guide and frame the discussion in a way that would have had Fenn and June walking out tentatively reconciled, aware of their problems, and working to fix them.

        What's more likely - that the uber-competent devil-channeling Val failed, or that she got exactly the outcome she was looking for? My view is that in a lot of ways, Val made the choice for Fenn and June, here, that they weren't going to work out and jumped ahead to that outcome. Fenn came in thinking it was "just a fight" and June had similar thoughts. They left broken up. Is the same Val, who can model a traumatic breakdown and how it will cause schisms in a group she hardly knows, simply not able to treat people she's intimately acquainted with with kid gloves? Draw your own conclusions, I suppose.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          I'm on the fence on whether Val consciously decided to sabotage the relationship (it's not like she grew up in the sort of environment that rewarded principled ethics), but either way, I do wonder what the thought process was in deciding that Val should be Joon and Fenn's couple counselor.

          Leaving aside that therapy on close friends is a bad idea in general, Val had very strong incentives to want Joon and Fenn to break up. Even if we assume she didn't break them up consciously, she probably let some bias creep in without realizing it. Even if she didn't, that doubt is going to color her relationship with Joon (and maybe Fenn) for *years*.

          I mean, they're rich, and they have a teleportation key. If they want couple's counseling, hire a therapist. If they want to give Val some experience at therapy, have her get some formation first, and give her a part-time job with people she has no prior relationship with.

          >As a glimpse into Val's thoughts, this shows both that Fenn/June comes second to group cohesion in terms of her priorities and also that Val is capable of incredible leaps of logic.

          Remember that Val has the equivalent of thousands of years of experience, here, so I don't know that the leaps of logic were 'incredible.'

          >I didn't expect the therapy conversation to magically fix all their problems. I did expect that Val, capable of determining that the relationship "wouldn't be salvageable" (is she a precog, now?), would also be capable of guiding the conversation in such a way as to have Fenn and June leave aware of their problems and working to bridge those "disconnects" having slightly "kissed and made up." Instead they left with their relationship over.

          Wait, if the problem is "they're in a relationship," then isn't it the case that the therapy conversation magically solved all of their problems? I think she was basically right about what interested Juniper about Fenn, and how that conflicted with what interested Fenn about Juniper. I think the version where Juniper sees Fenn as an equal and a resource, rather than 'the fun one,' and they're able to establish an equal partnership, happens because Juniper and Fenn stop dating for a while and he treats her like a coworker and then they later resume dating, if it makes sense for both of them.
          ```

          - u/ivory12:
            ```
            Thanks for your thoughts. First, there's no sarcasm attached to my use of the word incredible. It's clear Val is, socially, operating several levels beyond where anyone else in that room is. Together with your second point that's pretty much the gist of what I'm trying to say. Val sees the relationship itself as a problem, for whatever reason - that's not why Fenn and June went into the room, though. That's not what they wanted out of her "therapy." If Val wanted to, she could have done a lot more work to heal their budding rift. Instead they broke up.

            Because - it appears to me - she made the unilateral decision they should break up for them. That their relationship didn't match up with her paradigm/ideal of a healthy one, plus the fact that them breaking up would lead to a better group dynamic for the Council of Arches as a whole. That's a decision that I see as incredibly paternalistic from someone specifically in that room to mediate. Someone whose own life experience when it comes to romantic relationships, by the way, can be summed up as "has read Harry Potter." I don't think that's Val's choice to make. 

            Like June said to the Locus, and I'm paraphrasing, "it didn't feel unhappy." Maybe you're right, and Val's right, that June and Fenn were interested for different reasons, looking for different things, and had several issues communicating. That doesn't mean their relationship isn't worth pursuing. They were still happy. And, contrary to Val, I do think they made each other better people.

            Again, I'm being fully serious when I say Val's incredible in social terms. If she can so accurately predict their flaws and relationship conflicts and how things will end up, though, she should also be able to model their behaviour in the room right in front of her. I think you have to take away that Val got exactly the result she wanted out of that session. A result that both (a) diminishes Fenn and June's own agency in their own damn relationship and (b) isn't in line with what they were looking for when they sought out her help.

  I have a lot of separate thoughts about this set.

  \- I really, really liked the counseling chapter.  Probably my favorite yet.  

  \- I think Pallida is more likely to provide a love interest for Amaryllis than Juniper, even though it's obviously starting from somewhere unhealthy.  I don't think Amaryllis is going to get in a relationship with Juniper, because why would you want to be with someone that is mildly revolted by touching you?  Sex with Amaryllis in some ways would feel tantamount to rape because there would definitely be a coercive aspect to the mismatched needs.

  \- I do think that one or more characters will flip shit on Bethel; she doesn't make sense as a companion right now.  She's too useless in a majority of actions the group can take, because she's stationary.  Ropey makes a better companion than she does.  The worst part is that she probably could have ended the fight much sooner.

  \- Valencia's social fu is not infallible.  She thought Heshnel would probably be on their side, and at first glance it appears like he wasn't.  She also thought Everett and Gemma would be on the same side.  They clearly weren't.  At the same time, her reluctance to drop the devil after counselling was alarming.

    Note that Amaryllis is capable of hacking her own soul. She recognizes that Juniper wants her and that it would be pragmaticly useful to be in a relationship with him. If she wanted to then she could get rid of her dislike of being touched, crank her libido way up, and increase her romantic interest in Juniper. I don't think she will because she's smart enough to know that being a rebound is not likely to last, and that it would be too obvious that she was doing it for mercenary reasons.

  Thoughts:

  * I doubt that Val sabotaged joon/fenn.  Infernals are ill-equipped to heal, and we have seen little evidence recently that Val wants to get with Joon -- I'm betting that she simply overestimated her abilities, or was worn down from overuse.
  * Holy somkes, RIP Fenn.  They still have her soul, but who wants to bet that the Locus won't be as keen to reincarnate her, if that means creating a pattern of use that constrains the locus.  If that WAS permissible, then at least they can now hire someone to sit in the time chamber and play mom to Fenn
  * Perhaps a quest in the future to find the exclusion zone which made it impossible to overwrite a soul in its entirety?  That would be another way to bring fenn back...
  * Interesting the restrictions on immortality -- however, there are a number of characters floating around who have gotten past all of that.  I'd guess that the soul decays at the same rate for all characters?  If so, that's a very slow rate, given the number of very old people around.  If damnation in hell is eternal, then that means that decay halts in hell.  Soul magic would likely prevent physical or mental decay.  Perhaps skin magic, making a complete encasement around the soul (as described in Chapter 80, could wall the soul in and extend its lifespan?
  * You can see another realization of this game where Joon focuses on his social skills more.  In that outcome, he would have his loyalties much higher, and get wicked companion bonuses.  Bethel would be more inclined to come with on trips, and the party would be more powerful together.  It is rapidly becoming clear that the value of the social links between party members is very important.
  * On a related note, it is likely that Joon will respond to this by investing a point or two into SOC, mitigating some of these issues.  However, it's unlikely that he'll invest deeply into SOC, since that would remove most of the interpersonal conflict from the story, which is a major story thread.
  * Looks like the team has a few allies now? Pallida was helpful.  I hope that Joon isn't to consumed in rage to save/trust her... Their knowledge and resources could be invaluable, and may allow them to bring Fenn back more easily.

            Lets say he could copy over the mental parts of Fenn. I'll admit that would work for the short term. But people change over time.  Joon would have to either keep her eternally the same, or decide what minute alterations to make.

    I can totally see a lot of twists around Val, but I like her character so much as it is I'm choosing to just dismiss the possibility out of hand. I'll let myself worry about it if and when I'm forced to.

    I kind of hope Fenn stays dead for at least a while. Having a second reincarnation so soon would be rather trivializing. But yes, I suspect she might come back eventually, it certainly seems within possibility. TBH, having her die just after we'd looked through the hells took a lot of the impact away─as long as she doesn't end up there herself, that is.

      It's likely that Joon will pursue Fenn as his first priority, given his unwillingness to accept death (though that may be a plotline in itself). But it definitely won't be trivial:

  ... crazy theory, but this feels like the DM was mad that JuniperXFenn was going so well, and decided to *subtly* maybe use Valencia as a proxy to mess that up so that his OTP (Amaryllis, who he specifically designed for Joon) could flourish.

  It didn't work completely since it was only a "break" and there was a good narrative chance of them growing mature apart from each other and then a "second chance" happens which sticks since now they both know each other's flaws intimately and hopefully have taken steps to alleviate them.

  To prevent this, the DM actually kills off Fenn. Just like all of Uther's love interests, this has a tangible external cause (the enemies using soul-acid so that Juniper couldn't reincarnate in hell, and soul dissolving being one of the very few things Juniper could heal), and *just* enough coincidences (Fenn being taken out last, given the crown last, and ALSO being healed last) to make it look inevitable, which means high possibility of DM fuckery/narrative causality. 

  I know Juniper decided to take him at face value, but I'm not sure that was the right call, since they *still* don't know what motivates him.

        this is true. I usually only run groups that I have known personally for a long time though, so my thoughts on what is or is not a good idea for a cursed item may be skewed by that.

      - u/russxbox:
        ```
        I was sure it had been stated explicitly that Joon dated her and it didn't end well, but it seems I imagined it. I did find the reference to a girlfriend other than Tiff or Fenn in chapter 97: 

        >"She’s the only other person he’s been with,” said Fenn. “I know that I would prefer if you changed.”

        >“Er,” I replied. “Technically there was another.”

        >“Wait, what?” asked Fenn, looking over at me. “When? On Earth, or Aerb?”

        >“Earth,” I said.

        >“Well then why don’t I know about it?” asked Fenn.

        >“It’s a long story,” I said. “Can I be a chickenshit and write you a letter?”

        >Fenn crossed her arms over her chest. “Well … fine.” She said it in a voice that let me know that it wasn’t at all fine, and that she was only agreeing because she didn’t want to be an outrageous hypocrite. “I just didn’t know you had another girlfriend. I told you all about my boyfriends.”

        >“She wasn’t technically a girlfriend,” I said. “Or, maybe only technically a girlfriend. I shouldn’t have said anything.”

        I could have sworn, on reading your comment but before looking for it, that Maddie was specifically mentioned. It seems I just drew the conclusion with her being the only other female from Earth listed as part of the gaming group crossed with the falling out where she is mentioned by name. Luckily I turned out to be right, but I guess I have an excuse to reread and examine where else I've been making leaps that might pay off later.

          There was another related thought, [actually](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/26623692):

          > <...> I found the sight of Amaryllis to not actually be the most erotic thing I had ever seen in my life, instead taking a close second. The position of first is not one that I intend to recount here, but it would suffice to say that I’d briefly had a girlfriend back on Earth, and she had been putting effort into seduction, even though she didn’t need to.

          As far as I could tell it would be OOC for Tiffany to "put effort into seduction", which implied he had another girlfriend, all the way back in Chapter 18.

          Also, [fun fact](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/34742762):

          >Group, in rough order of appearance: Arthur, Ricky, Greg, Trev, Reimer, Craig, Maddie, Aaron, Tom, Tiff, Rache, Colin, Ana

          I was pretty sure that this "Ana" was the second girlfriend, ever since Chapter 105, but apparently she was just a red herring.
          ```

          - u/russxbox:
            ```
            Oh, great. I was wrong on both counts! It looks more and more like I was insufficiently careful in reading and came to the correct conclusion about the second girlfriend through sheer dumb luck. Ah, well, broken clocks et cetera.

            Also, it looks like we both skimmed right over poor Rache, who I'm sure is a very nice person and just as deserving of intricate fan theories about her shared past with Joon. So I suppose I'll make some up since I'm going to reread anyway.

    > Joon. You tried to save Fenn last. I think that sums up your actual thoughts on her.

    I don't think it's necessarily as meaningful as that. He was going to have to save *somebody* last, one way or another. Should he have made a conscious decision to save Grak last, just in order for the last one to not be Fenn?

    I agree that it's a *suspicious* coincidence that Fenn died right after the break-up, but I see at least three possible culprits: Juniper (as per your argument), Valencia (either recognizing that Fenn is doomed and subtly manipulating Juniper to save Grak instead, or (less plausibly) orchestrating the entire thing as per u/NoYouTryAnother's theory), and the narrative.

    **Edit:** On second thoughts, he also dragged her out of the building last. Which is possibly why she died sooner than everyone else. Hm.
    ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      Joon had good reasons for pulling her out of the building last. He went for Solace first as she's the healer and Grak was right next to her so he took both out of the fort together. When he went back in he was confronted straight away with Valencia struggling to drag Amaryliss out - presumably from context she was kinda close to being rescued, so he helped Valencia drag Amaryliss out. I thought the sequence of events was all very natural and understandable. The later decision to attempt to heal Fenn last (and the fact Valencia casts a look at Fenn on the ground before leaving the helmet on Grak) is more open to question imo.

This soul would never have a body, and the image of Fenn’s body that I’d written over would never change either.

    At 4 weeks, this update was the longest delay in the serial's history. It used to be updated every 2 days-ish, but has changed since to a few chapters in a batch update every ~2 weeks.
    ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    It updates sporadically but fairly frequently; in another comment thread I saw "about every couple weeks" per batch of 2-4 chapters, and something about possible slight forewarning if you're on some Discord channel.

  Feels like this is a major turning point for Joon. Now he's confronted with the death of another person important to him, except this time he can do something concrete about it. His hand is being forced for good or ill. But what's the lesson here...? What's the moral at the end?

  If he succeeds, it distorts his coping mechanism for the death of loved ones. Does he truly intend to play Aerb's over-god and create utopia at the end of this road? 

  If he succeeds at a price, it's just more depression fuel of the world he created where "evil couldn't be undone...and the world would never be set right." But maybe the takeaway is that we live in an imperfect world and we can only ever try our best.

  If he fails, he's going to have to seriously relearn how to cope. And like others joke about Val, he hopefully has an effective grief counselor. On the *bright* side, the game won't be skewing his acceptance of the finality of death.

  Regardless, I'm awfully sad. Like for others, Fenn was my favorite character and the primary breath of life in their dour party. O One True God of Aerb, master of not just the physical layer, or the game layer above that, but of the reality both are embedded in … I know it's naive and selfish, but please don't let her stay dead. Amen.

    Why would you want to accept the finality of death, in a world like Aerb?

  I liked this story a lot so far -- mainly the video game logic, as well as Fenn's romance subplot. But I feel like the video game logic has taken a backseat to long political conversations. And now that Fenn's gone too, I doubt this story has much coming for me to enjoy.

  Can someone explain how exclusions work? Is it just really powerful magic?
  ```

  - u/Badewell:
    ```
    It's talked about a bit in Chapter 94. There's some speculation, but we don't know how or why they're happening.

    Relevant passage:

    >The so-called exclusions came in three basic forms, all geographically restricted. The normal exclusions were like the one that covered the Risen Lands, where some kind of magic (or physics) had proven itself broken and been locked off from the rest of the world by some unknown force or entity (through the book, it was simply called ‘the exclusionary principle’, as a way of dodging the question about what was actually happening behind the scenes). Enpersoned exclusion zones were slightly different, as the magic was locked to a single person in addition to the region locking, and entad exclusions were that, but for a magic item rather than a person.

  Just finished the new chapters. I really really enjoy this story. Does the author have an update schedule anywhere that I am just to blind to see? I'd like to know when to expect some new chapters, if that's possible.
  ```

  - u/MuonManLaserJab:
    ```
    No set schedule. Often every two or so weeks, I think, with a bunch of chapters at once. The dates posted are on the chapters.

    There's a discord which sometimes has updates it seems (there was one this weekend that he was planning to finish and post). It's linked somewhere.

  I'm the kind of reader who tends to enjoy the lore/worldbuilding a lot more than the interpersonal stuff, so it was a little jarring to get mostly character drama, when I was expecting to get more Uther stuff and/or world details. That said, it was interesting to see the Official Couple actually talk through their issues, even if it may have ultimately been detrimental to the relationship.

  I bet Blue Fields is super heavily irradiated.

    I assumed they are called the Blue Fields due to the blue color of [Cherenkov radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation)

  Late to the party, but I had to come and get it out...

  Man this latest batch was a depressing ride!

  Props for the convincing, gut wrenching writing style. Actually, it was 3 strikes for me:

  1. The relationship that's been nurtured for countless chapters, vivisected, slaughtered
  2. Fenn, the fun, carefree character that was breathing some lightheartedness (sometimes) into the story, abandoned and bled to death
  3. The plot to eventually heroically rescue the soul of the latter and along destroy the hells and save trillions of endlessly suffering souls, annihilated

  Can't wait for the next tragedy to unfold!

  Idiot ball detected. Like going into likely ambush. Observation wards are weak explanation, Jun team has their own warder. Not taking void guns into potential fight with stone golem. Not preparing any battle plan at all. What if home team would rigged negotiation room with explosives? Etc.
  ```

  - u/vaniver:
    ```
    They explicitly considered Prince's Invulnerability, but it only gives you six seconds of protection, it's not clear it would have helped against the soul poison, and Joon decided the equivalent of "they're less likely to attack us if we think they're less likely to attack us." Which isn't the idiot ball--I think this was true with Masters, for example.

    The thing that's not obvious to me is why they didn't take part of the day to, say, call Masters on the phone and say "ok, now that we're safely out of the reach of your illusion magic, let's talk. In particular, tell us about the people who attacked you and extracted us."
    ```

      Lack of phones? Remote communication seems like it's more sparse on Aerb than on Earth, maybe because of easier long distance travel.

    >What if home team would rigged negotiation room with explosives?

    Did you skip a chapter? This was directly stated, they had a plan for as many situations as they had time for.
