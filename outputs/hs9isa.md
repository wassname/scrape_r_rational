## Help me remember a story?

### Post:

It's an isekai LitRPG about a world with Lavi instead of air. The main character is a woman. Right at the beginning her eye is removed and replaced with a crystal that has an AI in it. She develops very high poison resistance and this becomes a major plot point later when she needs to hunt through a toxic area to find a special flower so that she and her friends can level up.

Anyone know the story?

    I am very pleased to know that this is on royalroad instead of the author's own (quite badly formatted) website.

      A tale as old as time.

      In general, I despise the centralization of content onto a few big sites.
      In this case, the original website was slow and annoying enough that It's less egregious.

        Yep! My ideal preference would be that the author's website be good and that I get to use than instead of RoyalRoad, but in this case the website working right is more important than spiting the ad servers.
