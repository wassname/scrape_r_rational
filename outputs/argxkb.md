## Should I keep reading Practical Guide to Evil?

### Post:

I'm starting chapter 8 and I'm worried the story's going to go in a direction where I won't enjoy it anymore. What do I mean? Basically, I really dislike evil characters. I'm worried that this is gonna be a story about Catherine falling down the slippery slope of Evil, caring less and less about the morality of her actions, and being warped by her Role.

Is there a ray of hope throughout, or does it keep getting worse?

I'm not bashing the story, I just don't want to spend my time on something I know I'm gonna hate.

  Without getting deep into spoilers territory, Catherine never stops caring about the morality of her actions.  She *is*, however, an "ends justify the means" sort of girl, but she doesn't often get to a position where she's easily confident that she's at the right point on that Laffer Curve, if you will.

  Chapter 8, as in chapter 8 of the very first arc? A lot happens, and I don't want to spoil it, but in general she gets MUCH more ruthless then chapter 8. At no point do you think "wow, Catherine's obviously turned evil" however

        The Nuremberg Trials gave out death sentences, to be executed by hanging which resulted in death in seconds (your neck snaps). Crucifixion is a slow, painful death, taking place over days as your body dies of exposure to the elements and tiredness from your arms holding your body up.

          If I remember right, in story most of them were killed quickly first before being hung up as a symbol. This was considered merciful

  ```
  Catherine will always worry about her actions, but she ain't a hero nor someone who considers herself a good person. Her morals operate on "no one gets to kill Callowans except for me".

  She will do things that make you blanch. She will do things that will make you cheer.

  Her friends will banter and her enemies commit atrocities.

  And the Black Knight will continue to be glorious.

  Spoilers for up to Chapter 12. I think I made it vague enough that you can read the spoilers, but you might want to wait until after reading that chapter.
  >!She'll do something very evil in Chapter 12. Don't expect anything much worse than that. It gets mentioned later on as one of her biggest regrets; she thought it was necessary at the time, but in the long run it wasn't really.!<

  Another vague spoiler, for an example of a notable atrocity:
  >!A certain group massacres/enslaves tens of thousands of people. After defeating them, she has the people directly responsible crucified. Hundreds of them!<

  In any case, the story isn't really about a good person becoming an evil one. It's more about trying to create progress in a world that's designed not to go anywhere. Or maybe trying to make something that will last in a world where a single person could potentially have the power to destroy entire cities. Main character doesn't commit any horrible atrocities lightly, at least. No slaughtering civilians/non-combatants, nothing evil done without good reason.

  I'd recommend you keep reading. There's a difference in-story between evil and **Evil**. Pretty much every character has to make the best of their circumstances, and sometimes it involves copious amounts of murder when people just don't listen to reason. But Catherine never stops thinking about whether she's right or wrong, or debating the morality of her actions vs alternatives she had/didn't have.

  If your not a fan of Moral greyness and bad guy MC's, PGTE isn't for you, is Cat evil? I'm honestly not sure, it's a pretty hard question with a lot of variables, of you want to find out then keep reading, but if the answer being yes is enough to turn you off than that's fine, it's not for everyone.
  ```

- u/TrebarTilonai:
  ```
  Catherine is sort of similar to Taylor from Worm in that her morality is very much shades of grey. There is some degree, as well, of protagonist-bias towards viewing Cat as moral. She does some terrible things, but she also does some great things.  


  Remember that in this context "Evil" = agency and free choice while "Good" = unthinking worship of the gods. More or less. Cat certainly doesn't worship the Gods Below or Above, and there's a reason a lot of readers went into a lot of discussion about the possibility of her somehow creating a "Neutral" third faction.  


  In short, this is NOT a book about a character falling down the slippery slope of Evil, so if that is your concern, don't worry about that. She's not really going to become a paragon of virtue at any point either, though. Cat is practical and seems to have a knack for subverting the narrative tropes that drive the world, and she can be ruthless in pursuit of her goals. But it's not a slippery slope story.

  I just finished binging over the last couple weeks and caught up yesterday. Depending on what your threshold is for "down the hole to evil", you will probably be ok. That being said....the author needs an editor REAL BAD. There are a ton of sentence structure mistakes in nearly every single chapter that are usually just enough to make me re-read the sentence a time or two to figure out what they intended but occasionally make a sentence completely unintelligible. A fresh set of eyes to help catch those would make a world of difference. As I just finished the binge, it obviously wasn't bad enough to make me quit the story, but it would be nice to not have to get through those every time.

  Idle musing:  if at a point where you're worried you might regret if you continue reading, it could be worth throwing the dice by reading a few of the latest chapters, or else arbitrarily-chosen chapters much later than your current position.  If it increases your inclination to read other chapters, then benefits outweigh costs; if it decreases your inclination to read other chapters, then there are only benefits and next-to-no costs (where 'costs' are spoiling of events which you would otherwise want to read).

  For myself, somewhat echoing  [werafdsaew](https://www.reddit.com/user/werafdsaew), I tend to (ideally) read for as long as I enjoy something, then drop it if I start no longer enjoying it.  Ah, but if there's a fiction which I've enjoyed overall and later find I'm not enjoying, I'll often drop it for the time being, then much later read the latest chapter occasionally, then resume reading if I find it fun.  At that point, reading backwards through previous chapters, again stopping the filling-in if reaching a point from the other direction not found enjoyable.

  Ah yeah, you might want to turn back on this one. Catherine's slippery slope is a little less tolerable than Taylor from *Worm*, for me at least, because *Worm* spent the majority of time with villain-on-villain battles, and put more effort into making the heroes genuinely flawed (but interesting) characters. APGTE has a little bit of this, but for the most part, Catherine and her allies resort to killing (first) to solve most of their problems, she spends a lot more of the time fighting much more sympathetic characters, and the fact that she behaves rationally in a setting that's purpose-built for narrative plot devices stops feeling clever >!about the time she and her friends shoot the head off of a pompous hero during his monologue.!< (after that point, it just feels like she and her legion of terror are going around kicking dumbass puppies) I still think it's worth reading, because I had a lot of fun with it, but if you can't stomach the fact that Catherine's character arc is as predictable as a rigged carnival game, you might not want to continue.

  (Side note for everyone else who has read the story: you get an explanation for the setting's technological stasis pretty early on, and >!I can't be the only one here that *really fucking hates this*. The setting itself is interesting, but the fact that there's really nothing anyone can do to get out of the medieval squalor kind of puts a damper on any achievement. I stopped reading at around the end of book three while I was waiting for book four to end, and I really hope that this changes sometime in the final two books.!<)
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    The setting does more to define why there is technological stasis than any work over read since Mistborn.

    But yeah, if you only define progress through technological development this isn't a story for you. Because this ain't that sort of story.
    ```

    - u/Robert_Barlow:
      ```
      A forewarning, just in case anyone doesn't pick this up: this is a worldbuilding comment, and thus mostly nitpicking.

      A story doesn't need to define why there is technological stasis. The real world didn't need some dumb explanation about progress being impossible to have thousands of years of pre-industrial technology. By defining *why* there is technological stasis, an author has created the concept of technological stasis where it previously didn't need to exist, and that throws up a whole bunch of complications, especially if your protagonist is clever. Like: why hasn't anyone done this clever thing the protagonist has done before? Or: if someone else was stopped from doing this before, why is our protagonist granted special exceptionalism? You *can* answer these questions, but without technological stasis, you don't need to. APGTE answers those two questions very well, but it didn't actually need to at all. Moreover, by introducing the concept, it's creating an unresolved (or unresolvable) conflict. >!Black is legitimately distressed by the Red Letter, and then he drops on us that there's nothing anyone can do about it? The guy who is currently throwing up a huge middle finger to the gods is going to lie on his back like a puppy? It's rational, but it's not emotionally satisfying in the slightest, and it really does a lot of damage to his character.!<

      I find it kind of funny that you're implying, by saying that progress isn't only technological, that there isn't *also* this massive sociopolitical stasis in APGTE. >!The Dread Empire has remained mostly unchanged for *fifteen hundred* years, and it's only with Black that things have started to shift. Sure, there's the in-story justification of Names, but Names didn't necessarily have to lead to sociopolitical stasis - it's not the only logical conclusion from the premise.!< After all, even though it feels like the tropes of modern fantasy stories have been around forever, they're only really a couple of centuries old. This stasis puts a massive constraint on worldbuilding because there is a big gap in what historical events are relevant to the plot - it's either stuff that happened hundreds of years ago or stuff that happened in the last three decades.

      Again, I greatly enjoyed my time with the story. It was really fun to read, and it has a lot of great moments. I plan to continue with the rest of book four and five sometime very soon. But I feel like it was in spite of some really glaring worldbuilding oversights which made the story feel a lot less satisfying than it could have been, purely because of the historical context. I think, at the end, when Catherine and co. have made some real, irreversible historical change through their actions, my opinion on this will ease up a bit, but until that point, it feels like the chance of them changing anything is tenuous.

      - u/werafdsaew:
        ```
        A *rational* story certainly needs a answer to why there is tech stasis, when it's been shown that Evil nations are actually pretty innovative.
        ```

        - u/Robert_Barlow:
          ```
          I don't think I phrased that well. A rational story doesn't need to invent an explanation as to why there is a medieval level of technology for thousands of consecutive years, when a better, more robust one can be found in nature. Science takes time, superstition is easy, people are poor. Creating an explanation for "tech stasis" that is more complicated than that is injecting complication where it doesn't need to exist, and can interfere with 
           the sanity of other pieces of the story. And it also strikes me as kind of petty. Like, the author is so proud of the setting that they've made that *nobody other than the protagonist* has permission to change it.

          So what if the evil nations are innovative? So what if, in two-hundred years, they learn how to invent machine guns or something? The *present* of the story shouldn't have to be concerned about that. The only thing that needs to be explained is why they don't have machine guns already. The author of APGTE chose "technological stasis" and then wrote an infuriating >!gnomes-did-it!< explanation, which reads like the book version of "because I said so". But the author could have just as easily, I don't know, removed the ridiculous requirement that the Dread Empire be a *fifteen-hundred-year-old* institution (because it oozes rationality to say that the caricature of an evil, unstable empire is more stable than 90% of the nations that exist in real-life history), or started them off with stone-age weapons, or claimed that the constant war and changing leaders impeded progress, or even better, a combination of all three.

          So the argument is that, by inventing an explanation for technological stasis, an author is extending a simple problem about explaining the past well into the future of the story, for the sake of a setting that *didn't really need any help* in order for people to suspend their disbelief about it.
          ```

          - u/werafdsaew:

            The problem is that Calernia is supposed to be a backwater continent.  Given the level of innovations shown in Calernia, the industrial revolution should already have happened on some of the other continents, so an explanation is needed for why there isn't flying ships trading with Calernia.
            ```

      - u/FeepingCreature:
        ```
        They didn't have to _necessarily_ lead to technological stasis, because reality isn't something that tries to tend to good and only does evil when it cannot be persuaded otherwise. If evil has a 20% chance of happening, then two out of ten times, evil will happen.

        (I haven't read the story.)

    Spoilers for Worm and PGTE >!Something that is very important when comparing a work of high fantasy or mediaeval times to one based in a modern relatively progressive world, the baseline for morals is completely different, this applies extra to works in which morals are defined by a higher power or god, in PGTE the morals that the main character grew up with and learned as she matured are vastly different from the morals we were taught as we grew up, murder is much easier to consider in a world with wars  that a character may have to participate in happening nearby, to the people that grow up in these world's, the idea of killing for what you stand for is the same as dying for what you stand for, is Cat a little to quick to choose killing as an answer to her problems? Maybe, but I don't think that makes her definitively evil based on the moral baseline of the setting. It's important to judge anything within context, and although Worm and PGTE have a lot in common, I feel like they are both rather good in vary different ways.!<

      I don't live in that setting, though, and I feel like it's reasonable to dislike a story based on how it makes you feel as a result of morals. I personally don't think I should need to engage in miniature worldbuilding to find characters likeable, I prefer them to just be either likeable or unlikeable based on my honest reaction to them.
