    I think I'll down a shot for every death flag in the previous chapters that has lead up to this event.


    I think I'll get really drunk.
    ```

  - u/Daimon5hade:
    ```
    Tbf that seems like a heroic death flag no? Since normally villains don't have functional family units.

    Hell this whole event seems vaguely like a heroic story for Masego. Defending a city from a pillaging armada and losing your mentor/parents in the process.
    ```

    - u/TwoxMachina:
      ```
      As we all know, Heroes are usually orphans.

      And now Masego is doubly an orphan.

      Never knowing his birth parents, and his adoptive parents has just been killed by some big evil mask in the sky.

      &#x200B;

      Prepare for revenge, you evil Good God.
      ```

    - u/leakycauldron:
      ```
      Strongly agree. This is a heroic narrative for Heirophant.
      ```

      - u/AStartlingStatement:
        ```
        Well yeah, both parents killed in front of his eyes? It's the bat-man narrative.
        ```

    - u/vimefer:
      ```
      The Woe has been turning heroic for quite some time now. Ever since Cat died and was reborn, I'd say. The rescue of Black ? It reeks of heroic rescue and was foreshadowed by the flavour text on [chapter 49](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/08/29/chapter-49-wrangle/).

      That's my theory and I'll be running with it.
      ```

      - u/Daimon5hade:
        ```
        If that were true though I would say it makes Black even more dead tho, what's a more heroic story than a mentor dying for their apprentice.
        ```

        - u/vimefer:
          ```
          Yeah, but he hasn't been her mentor ever since the Doom of Liesse, so now he's been relegated to sidekick, much like Master Roshi to Goku. So unless the situation evolves further I think the mentor angle is deprecated.
          ```

  - u/Gr_Cheese:
    ```
    But how would you know that death flags exist in the first place? 

    Anyone who has thrown the flag has died, and everyone else who has attempted to throw a flag accidentally or otherwise (but wasn't important enough to be affected) has created a survivorship bias against death flags existing at all.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      They have extensive records on villainous monologues being invariably lethal if done near great heights, so I'm sure they have records of the last words of villainous family men too.
      ```

    - u/AStartlingStatement:
      ```
      Well if you lived in a world where narrative affects reality it would be really important to know what are the most likely death flags *in* narrative. 

      Like for example you would never under any circumstances say to your beloved "We will get married when I return from this battle. This, the last battle before I retire from soldiering". You might as well put a gun in your mouth!
      ```

- u/swaskowi:
  ```
  Holy shit. 

  As an aside, we now canonically know that "demonic" alignment isn't fixed, in that Tikoloshe is actually "good" (note the lower case g) and isn't just suborned into compliance.  Makes Good once again seem like giant dicks.
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    Didn't we always know that his binding effectively gave him free will while ensuring Wekesa and Masego's safety.
    ```

    - u/swaskowi:
      ```
      We know Masego thought that, all the other character's were not convinced and the common knowledge is that demons and devils will betray you at a moments notice, given the chance. 

      >[The two of them had never gotten along. Amadeus remained, even after over forty years, of the opinion that Tikoloshe was an unnecessary risk that should have long been dispensed with permanently.](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/11/02/interlude-apogee/)

      Also while I was looking for that quote I found this:
      >After they entered the second month of hard labour and sleepless nights, Wekesa jested that if he were a god he’s snap his fingers and put them all out of their misery.

      God damn it EE
      ```

      - u/ErraticErrata:
        ```
        > God damn it EE 

        I was wondering if someone would catch that.
        ```

        - u/swaskowi:
          ```
          For the record that was a respectful god dammit, I didn't mean to actually summon god :P
          ```

    - u/tavitavarus:
      ```
      Except Warlock destroyed the binding and Tikoloshe was still able to choose to remain and be destroyed.
      ```

      - u/BaggyOz:
        ```
        So? The details of the binding already established that the love was real.
        ```

        - u/tavitavarus:
          ```
          Oh, I know. I'm agreeing with you, but the interesting bit is that he was still able to exercise free will after the binding was broken.
          ```

          - u/Anderkent:
            ```
            Thus:

            >The incubus looked up at the sky.  
            >  
            >“I decide this,” he said, tone full of wonder. “Of my own free will.”  
            >  
            >His smile was blinding as the sun.  
            >  
            >“Isn’t that something?” Tikoloshe murmured.

            &#x200B;
            ```

          - u/BaggyOz:
            ```
            Why wouldn't he be able to? Bindings place restrictions they don't lift them.
            ```

            - u/tavitavarus:
              ```
              Masego explained it to Catherine back when they were travelling through the reflection in Arcadia. Devils are deterministic beings, they don't have free will. Tikoloshe was given something close to free will by Warlock's sorcery.

              'That contract is one of the single most complex pieces of sorcery in existence, Catherine, Father spent decades crafting the closest to the ability to make choices a devil can possibly have. Which means either Father forbade him to speak to me, or…'

              -Chapter 28 Archaic.
              ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      The critical part there is "effectively." Tagging an modifier like "almost" onto "free will" changes the tone entirely.
      ```

- u/MasterCrab:
  ```
  I'm guessing Hierophant is about to get a big power up from witnessing an actual god since his name is all about that.
  ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  Did we ever actually see any Named survive using all three of their Aspects? I mean, there was William killing Catherine, but Bard remarked that this scene meant "that the Lone Swordsman had lost, that Liesse was lost, that the rebellion was over". This may mean that enacting one's Role in full means ending it.
  ```

  - u/Malek_Deneith:
    ```
    Warlock used all three in second fight against Hedge Mage I think. Ranger runs all of hers 24/7 since they are passive. Not sure if Valiant Champion didn't use three killing Sabah.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      No, he didn't use Reflect against Hedge Wizard. We didn't  even know what it was called until the [Red Flower Vales interludes](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/25/interlude-lest-dawn-fail/). Ranger's narration didn't bold Learn, Perfect or Transcend, and we've seen it do so with Mirror Knight's Dawn, so we can't even tell if she actually has them (other than Learn, [Warlock has confirmed it](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/villainous-interlude-calamity-ii/)). Valiant Champion didn't use three of them, she used Rally twice.
      ```

      - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
        ```
        It doesn't bold them because all three are always active.

        They are pretty low-level Aspects in terms of power and scale. They only really work super well for Ranger as Hye is a half-elf who is already insanely strong.
        ```

        - u/Zayits:
          ```
          My point is that even explicitly passive Aspects ([Obey](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/04/26/heroic-interlude-appellant/), [Receive](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/31/hierarchy/), [Dawn](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/kaleidoscope-vi/)) are bolded when mentioned in the naration or by their wielders. Hell, she may be using side effects, like Tyrant of Helike can read minds without spending a Wish - [but even in that case it's bolded](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/09/25/villainous-interlude-thunder/)! I'm not saying those can't be hers, just that she's unlikely to have actually no active component to them. That's for someone like Hierarch, who's pretty much an opposite of hers in the sense that he refuses to act, no matter what he wants.
          ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    It's pretty common. Black uses all 3 of his in almost all his fights, since Lead and Conquer are passive, as does Hye. Warlock blew everything against the Witch, and William used all 3 and won his 3rd fight against Cat, though obviously lost later.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Warlock didn't use Link against the Witch of the Woods. Black Knight's Lead definitely isn't passive (Akua was able to detect [the moment he used it at Liesse](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/01/17/villainous-interlude-crescendo/), and he [mentioned consciously having to spread it between sixteen thousand legionaries](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2018/09/28/interlude-queens-gambit-offered/)), and we don't know what his version of Conquer actually *does*. William is the case that led me to the whole "death by overcommitting" line of thought.

      Seriously, guys. I can't be the only person who counts bullets here.
      ```

      - u/tavitavarus:
        ```
        Catherine used all of her aspects at Second Liesse, though not all in the same fight.
        ```

        - u/Zayits:
          ```
          Really? Because she didn't use Take in a fight, and her taking Diabolist's Call is probably a Winter power (seeing as she's done the same to the heroes later, and she didn't have her Name anymore in both cases). Contrast that with Akua, who Claimed the gate to the Fields of Wend, then Bound Catherine, and then (unsuccessfully) tried to Call her armies as a last resort.
          ```

          - u/tavitavarus:
            ```
            Did she not use Take? Hmm. My mistake. Although now that I think about it Black definitely used all three aspects in that battle. Lead and Conquer in the first phase of the battle and Destroy at the end.
            ```

            - u/Zayits:
              ```
              Destroy too was used after the battle, *still* nearly killed him, and we don't know how does Conquer manifest: we know that [it is better fit for war than skirmishes between Named](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2017/10/02/villainous-interlude-calamity-ii/), and the strenghtening of the legionaries at second Liesse seems to mostly fall under Lead. We only have Akua's word on the dubious notion of Black Knight opening the fight with *two* Aspects.
              ```

              - u/tavitavarus:
                ```
                Fair points.
                ```

  - u/Agnoman:
    ```
    Will did not use all of his aspects against Cat. He *tried* to use Triumph, but was interrupted by an exploding zombie horse and didn't do get a chance to do anything other than be grievously injured (which he then shrugged off with his second aspect Rise). If he used it, or if it had an effect, it was one that went entirely unnoticed and unremarked upon which would be weird after so much build up towards it.
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Good catch. It kept looking like an outlier to me, but I couldn't recall anything different with it.
      ```

- u/hailcapital:
  ```
  Huh, I was figuring either Wekesa or Tikoloshe would die in this fight, but not both. Man that's gotta be rough for Masego. Also, I wonder how the Ashurans / Procerans got a God Above to directly intervene. I don't think we've ever heard of that happening before. Hopefully their was quite a cost to be paid, because if they can do that for free... And lastly I guess does Wekesa get a death curse, or did his reflect trick count as that?
  ```

  - u/BaggyOz:
    ```
    Warlock's super Reflect was Below balancing the scales.
    ```

    - u/OmniscientQ:
      ```
      I'm pretty sure that Reflect was all Wekesa. The Gods Below gave him a second wind, which he spent tearing up Tikoloshe's contract so 'Loshe could run away. Of course, *love doesn't walk away*. Wekesa noted that Below wouldn't give him another boost.

      His own third aspect, though... Wekesa just pulled a Summon Bigger Fish. A God struck at him and failed to make it stick. His Reflect aspect let him respond in kind for one eternal, glorious moment.

      And, as others have noted, Masego the Heirophant got to Witness *all of it*.
      ```

      - u/BaggyOz:
        ```
        He wouldn't need aid from below to break his own binding, nor would he waste it on that when Masego is at risk.
        ```

        - u/OmniscientQ:
          ```
          He might need aid from Below if he had just seen the face of a God, crushing his bones and eyes and ears and leaving him bleeding from every hole in his body. My reading of it was that he was already broken and well on his way to death.

          Plus, his crafting of Tikoloshe's contract was described as meticulous and cautious beyond what most diabolists demand. I imagine that, when summoning a creature specifically designed for mind-reading and manipulation, Wekesa made sure the contract *couldn't* be dismissed merely by a stray thought.

          Him spending his second wind on that rather than Masego is potentially a fair point, but I have imagined having to choose between my daughter and my wife. The ethical calculus there is *not* as simple as you might think. I, at least, won't second-guess his priorities. Plus, he may have already decided on his course of action with Reflect, and knew he was about to save Masego. 'Loshe was the one who needed to get clear of the blast radius.

          Amusingly enough, had Wekesa left the contract in place, he could have forced Tikoloshe to run. Probably. But who knows what happens when the mortal half of a summoning contract dies? It's probable that there was a contingency that forcibly dispersed Tikoloshe in the event of Wekesa's death.
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            >Him spending his second wind on that rather than Masego

            He did both though? Isn't an exclusive one action thing.
            ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    And now Malicia is in trouble. She's down two of the Calamities, Masego is free to return to Catherine and Scribe is going to go berserk looking for Black.

    Assassin's still the wildcard. I don't imagine he'll be sent after the Woe or the Procerans. Maybe just pointed at the Dead King? Clean up the leftovers by using them. She wins either way. And Ranger has probably stuck her head out of her burrow.
    ```

    - u/hailcapital:
      ```
      Three, counting Sabah. I could see Assassin used against the Woe, I think it's getting closer and closer to a matter of whether risking Assassin is worth it than whether she wants the Woe dead.

      In Black's chapter where he realizes he's got ~1-2 years left he mentions possibly using Assassin to clear out the top of the Ashuran bureaucracy's hierarchy, which might be what he's doing.
      ```

    - u/lecupra:
      ```
      Have we had any interludes or such explaining how Assassin fits in with the Calamities?  E.g., how Scribe is loyal & subordinate to Black vs. Ranger being more friend/ally of convenience.
      ```

      - u/notagiantdolphin:
        ```
        No. The only time he has appeared on screen was when he tried to recruit Thief and in the bowels of Liesse. He's not really discussed.
        ```

        - u/RealAmaranth:
          ```
          He could be on screen in every book, maybe even every chapter. ;)

          I swear I remember it being canon that he was around at least once for every book though.
          ```

  - u/LordSwedish:
    ```
    >Hopefully their was quite a cost to be paid, because if they can do that for free

    You mean like, say, opening the possibility for a villain known for bringing hells to Creation temporarily getting the powers of a god? For some reason I doubt that Above is going to risk that happening again for quite some time.

    Also, remember that this is the **tenth** crusade. If there was ever a time for unprecedented meddling, this is it.
    ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  You never realize how much you love a character until they die.
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Black is going to ruin me when he dies.
    ```

- u/Agnoman:
  ```
  So that was a very, very full chapter. So much happened so quickly that there's an awful lot to go through. It's going to need a couple of rereads just to unpack it, I think.

  There wasn't a huge amount of incomprehensible magical jargon, which I'm happy about, and instead we got a really interesting look into Warlock's life (and by extension the lives of the Calamities) and it just really humanised all of them.

  Then there was an enormous battle - which i think was actually the largest fight we've had in the series, despite it's brevity, with direct interventions from the Gods Above and Below - and holy crap the Crusade actually did something! After the Battle of the Camps or the Vales it's good to see Good being a threat.

  And so now Warlock is gone, which happened right after we were given a lot of reasons to care about him, his husband, and their relationship, so it was actually quite upsetting. But this is going to have huge repercussions going forward.

  Malicia is a bit screwed. She just lost one of her biggest assets, which doesn't put her in a great spot if things come down to a straight fight for her (which it might - I can't recall offhand whether Ashur have more ships/men -EDIT: they do but a limited amount-, and there's always the looming Callow situation). Plus, Masego just lost his biggest incentive to pull punches against Praes himself, or to argue against fighting Praes, which are both fairly big deals.

  Also, Masego just lost his fathers. Poor guy. That resolves both the issues of him being pulled between his old family and his new, and thankfully sidesteps the whole personal-drama-because-people-can't-communicate thing he had going on with his parents. Thank God. Although now he's got no warning on the dangers surrounding the Dead King's knowledge.

  Then there's further strain being put on the resources of the Grand Alliance, and right before the Dead King steps out. There's reveals about how and when the Gods step out to play and what that looks like. And a bunch of other important details.
  ```

- u/AurelianoTampa:
  ```
  Amazing chapter, but all I could think at this part was: 

  >It sunk into the depths, the radiance slowly drowned by the sea of  blood, and he laughed. Laughed until it evaporated in a storm of blood  mist, the thing full and untouched. Not a face, he thought again. It was  a mask. Heartbreakingly, impossibly perfect. He looked upon the visage  of a god, and that god spoke.

  Just got around to finishing up Book 3 last week, can anyone tell me (in a non-spoilery way) if it seems like Book 4 is approaching the end? I'm not a huge fan of reading new chapters as they come out, so I prefer to wait until each book (or clearly delineated arc like wildbow does) is complete then bundle them together.
  ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    It's... not really clear. A lot of shit has happened already in Book 4, but the plot looks like it might checking items off a list, and we know that list isn't exhausted yet.

    Unless the unchecked items on the list are to become major plot elements of the next book, in which case we could be coming up on a "Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked" style of cliffhanger.
    ```

  - u/werafdsaew:
    ```
    According to [WOG](https://www.reddit.com/r/PracticalGuideToEvil/comments/9fb55v/overall_lengthtime_remaining/e5zpm5p/?context=0) book 4 has 7 story arcs.  This is probably the end of the third, so less than half way?

    ```
    Despair not, Malicia's not out of bad ideas yet.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  One thing I wasn't clear on, was that God summoned by a hero?  If so, that would certainly count as breaking the rules of engagement set between Catherine and the Grey Pilgrim.  Maybe it would even if it wasn't summoned by one, since they can be seen as larger proxies for above and below.
  ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    Northern Proceran host and the Army of Callow are the only ones abiding by those rules, otherwise Black wouldn't be going around sacking villages in Procer.
    ```

  - u/Arganthonius:
    ```
    The rules were declared null and void by the church in Procer.
    ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    I think it was "no summoning angels" not "no summoning the Gods Above themselves."

    Which is one hell (heaven?) of a loophole.
    ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      I mean, based on the response by the Gods Below, its a fucking awful idea. There's a good chance the entire region is just gone.
