  I liked Scott Alexander's writing on this same issue, [the Dead Child as a Unit of Currency](http://www.raikoth.net/deadchild.html) a little better. It made broadly the same point but in a more interesting to read fashion. His other [writings on charity](http://slatestarcodex.com/tag/charity/) are also quite good.

    Singer says $200. Scott says $800. Today's child-life costs $3000 according to Givewell's AMF listing. A sign of progress over time, or a sign of wildly fluctuating estimates?

    I think it matters how much it is exactly, you know? I'd donate more if I could buy one life for only 200.

  I'm going to say some things here that are probably going to get me lots of negative karma, but I'm going to say it anyway.

  We're primates.  Like it or not, we all have that inner primate within us that drives us to measure ourselves against others.  That vestige of our ancestry insidiously worms its way into our interactions with others, on almost every level.

  A very large part of why charity works is that it creates or preserves real or perceived power.  If you give X to Y, then Y is indebted to you.  That indebtedness is a power of sorts.  Even if it's not a real power, it massages that inner primate.  You just gave something to someone that was in need of something you could afford to discard.  Giving is a prerogative of dominance.  Ook.  Good.

  A lot of people might be thinking, "Oh, I never feel that way."  Really?  Let's explore the possibility that this is true.  Even of one were to completely write off the perception of hand-me-down power, there's still the matter of personal confidence and the perception of self-worth.  Even if no power calculations come into play at all.  No tax deductions, no favors owed, no residual good will, why might one give?  To feel good about oneself and feed one's perception of self-worth and confidence.  Doing good for others means that one must be a good person, right?  Self-confidence and self-worth are critical to us.  They are extremely potent drivers for our survival and prosperity.  Ook.  Good.

  That's not all though!  Someone with no needs unfulfilled might choose to give things away simply because they have more than they need.  Perhaps they are even irritated by their own excess.  This introspection, this giving, is performed because the giver has been successful or lucky.  In the Western world, it is expected of the powerful to give away some of their power.  It marks them as being 'normal' and part of the community of those with power.  Once you get to a certain income or level of measured worth, society pressures one to give to charity.  If one does not give like others in the same fiscal standing, there is a perceived lack.  That perception may be internal, what one thinks about oneself, or perhaps external, what others think and say about the skinflint.  In the Western world, living amongst many others with the ability to give, being charitable is expected.  Peer pressure!  Ook.  Good.

  I will not say that there aren't people who transcend the rest of us, who give, and get no real or perceived benefit of any type from the behavior of giving and charity, but those people are rare.  If you feel 'good' because you give to charity, then you are not one of those people.  The very fact that you feel 'good' means that some vestige of inner primate inside you is proudly waving a banana and cheering you on.  Ook.  Good.

  Let me be clear.  Without any reservations, I support charity as a temporary way to help others, especially for basic needs like food or medicine.  I have absolutely zero confidence that any sort of charity-based economy can be good.  Everyone's inner primate craves self-worth, and accepting charity is poisonous to self-worth.  Self-worth is the most important human infrastructure of all - we need to stop killing it.  Ook.

    Why is accepting charity poisonous to self worth? Let's put it in other terms. If someone donates some time to help you learn something or fix a problem you're having, do you necessarily have to feel lower self-worth because of it? Seems quite strange to me.

    Also, we're killing self worth? What?

    Ok, it could be true for certain people that they feel shitty when someone does something nice for them, but this specific comment is deriving some kind of grand sociological/biological conclusion from a few kludgy mental heuristics. I'm inclined to take the whole thing with a grain of salt.

  once upon a time, there was a remote village deep in the forest. this village was filthy rich. it was the vacation home of every self-respecting rich person in their society. it had little to no agriculture, producing far less food than it consumed. as a result, everything was imported. the farmers who traveled to the village did so because they knew the inhabitants were rich, and could charge far more for their goods there than anyone else. so, all the people who weren't rich who lived there had to raise their prices too, or else not be able to afford the farmer's prices. the cost of living was high, the production of critical goods low, and the production of luxury goods high.


  now imagine Singer is a wizard, and he found himself sickened by this village's decadence. "we could feed an entire village for a month with the money they spend on luxury items in a week!" he exclaims. so, good-intentioned, he lays a geas on the village to donate 90% of what they would have spent on luxuries to charity instead, and he goes on his merry way.


  everything works fine for a while, but soon the village starts noticing a decrease in the money it makes. for you see- most of the people in the village sell luxuries for a living. by cutting all luxury expenditures, singer hamstrung their income. soon, they can't afford the farmer's prices, the farmers don't find it worth the trip and the residents are forced to move or starve.


  the point is- that village, much like us, was living in an economic bubble that absolutely depended on everyone buying things they don't need. all its riches were illusory- none of the goods were actually worth what they cost, but the inflated price made it seem like they were. make no mistake, all bubbles pop eventually, but let's wait to deliberately pop this one until we're better prepared.

  ...you know, unless you like global recessions.

  The solution to world poverty is to decrease the population of the world and increase infrastructure.

  Give a man a fish, and he'll be back with his kids wanting even more fish.

  Teach a man to fish, and he'll realize the folly of giving a man his fish.

  IMHO, charity can help to fill an absence of capital, but it can't actually replace just giving people the means to fill their own damn needs.
