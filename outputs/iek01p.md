## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  Everyone in the world has a "ball", a little orb of matter approximately 30 centimeters across (volume of 14 liters) that floats around within maybe a foot of you. In its natural state, it's somewhat insubstantial, but with a little bit of focus and time, you can shape it. Once the ball has been shaped, it's roughly as dense and heavy as wood, though less easy to damage: damage can be repaired with a reshaping. Once a person has created a shape, becomes easier for them to recreate that shape. Shapes must be contiguous objects. Matter that's not used in the shape will quietly disappear until the shape has been unmade and/or changed.

  Thinking through the implications of this:

  * Everyone has a tool at hand for whatever they need, without having to carry anything. This means that whole swaths of economies cannot form because they are obsoleted by the ball. It also lowers the capital costs for a wide variety of things where shapes can replace tools.
  * Everyone is always armed, or could be armed with only a few seconds notice. (The exact limits on shapes are something that I'm still working out: I would rather not have guns, but would be fine with something more clever than guns that fills the same role. For a projectile-based weapon, you would have to carry the projectile(s) with you.)
  * Clothes can, in some circumstances, be partially obsoleted by the ball. Particularly, an umbrella to keep off the sun or rain is always handy, and in a pinch, depending on some specifics of the power (how easy it is to make bendy things, for a start) maybe actual protective clothes of some kind. Cruder armor would definitely be possible, with the easiest being a cuirass that you bind to yourself with a length of string/fabric/rope.
  * The shapes can replace a lot of tools and other things that you would take with you as you go, but the options get a lot bigger if you have the ability to augment your shapes, with (for example) a stick, a piece of leather, a wrap, or something like that. If projectile weapons, then this includes projectiles. This allows you to have more complicated tools than you otherwise could, and allows tools to be better (by for example protecting your hand with a grip).
  * In addition to common shape augments, you could carry around secondary pieces that slot into a shape, in order to make tools with moving parts, or to otherwise get around problems with the "one contiguous part" rule. Beyond that, two people working together can make two shapes that go together.
  I think this is all good and interesting, and needs a bit more thought to figure out what daily life looks like for people in this world, what norms and mores would develop around the balls and their shapes, etc.

  Some open questions I still have:

  * Saying that it's like wood when in shape form is ... fine, but there are questions about tension, deformation, etc. that probably need to be hammered out. Could you make a bow, if you had a string for it? ... probably?
  * What are the most useful shapes that a person could/would make? A knife, hammer, crowbar, staff, bowl, basket, and spear are all at the top of my list at the moment, but those are the primordials, the ones that you start out with as hunter-gatherers, rather than the stuff you would have in an advanced society.

  (Note: I posted this in the Wednesday thread as well.)

    Wait a second. The ball floats? And stays around you somehow?

    How does that work? Is it telekinetic? Can you just move the ball around psychically?

    Can you stand on top of the ball after shaping it into a platform, and then fly?

    Can the ball be separated from you by any means? What happens if you float the ball such that it is on the opposite side of a wall, solidify it, and then start running away from it? Will the ball break through the wall to get to you? Will it apply more force if you run faster? 

    What is the precision of shaping? Can you shape keys? No more need to worry about losing your house keys?

    Can you make a (very thin) bed with it? Really just a flat surface to place on the ground so you don't have to worry about lying on top of pebbles and stuff.

      > What is the precision of shaping? Can you shape keys? No more need to worry about losing your house keys?

      I think that's a good application, yeah, and would be even with relatively low levels of precision (since you could make keys and locks bigger to compensate). I'm not sure what I want to set as the upper levels of precision, but my feeling is "visible to the naked eye" would probably be the smallest effective change you could make.

      > Can the ball be separated from you by any means?

      No. The ball will just slip through invisible cracks to get to you if you there's a solid barrier in its way. I'm less certain about shapes: I think the most interesting rule, to me, is that your shape can stay how it is no matter how far away you are, but that you can change it back to ball form (and thus recall it) no matter how far away you are. (The ball/shape also disappears on death.)

      These are the kinds of rules you end up just tacking on though, and don't necessarily feel "clean".

        Hmm, how fast does the ball return to you? And how fast can you resolidify it?

        Can you solidify the ball while it's speeding towards you, thus creating a solid with a high velocity? (Dodge out of the way if you want to live though.)

        Can you repeatedly solidify the ball, drop it from a great height, unsolidify it, let the ball travel back up, then drop it again, for lots of free energy?

        Can you solidify your ball into a shape that disguises it as a construction material, then a long time later unsolidify it and send the building crashing down?

        On a smaller scale, could this also work for pitfall traps? Your targets think they are standing on solid ground, but instead they stand on your disguised solid ball, shaped into a pancake over the hole.

        This would probably be in the range of 3-8 micrometers with good lighting, like a strand of spider silk. That would make it relatively easy to construct a bow with an included string composed of twisted wood-like fibers which emerge from the ends of the bow staff, assuming you can form an object under tension so the bow is strung from the start.

    Keeping people in prison or as slaves would become exceedingly difficult. So difficult that aside from a few political prisoners both institutions would never really exist.

    Another thing I noticed is that you could make attachments out of other materials to make the shapes you make be more effective. 
    For instance you could buy a couple real dense balls of metal, that you then form your hammer around to make it much more dense.

    Or a thin sharp blade of metal that you attach to your knife/sword shape to make it sharper and tougher for a fraction of the cost of making a full metal knife or sword.

      Don't underestimate government's readiness to perform violence. Considering OP's rule that shape stays how it is no matter the distance, wardens can force prisoners to make the ball into a certain shape and store it in a 24/7-monitored room. If someone's shape disappears, they get a small army entering their confinement cell.

    If it's "like Wood" that actually allows a huge range of variation.  Consider the range from the  [densest wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lignum_vitae) to balsa wood.  Or the range from cured/treated hardwoods vs. freshly cut wood.

    If it isn't normally possible to rapidly dismiss the shaped object back into a ball (I don't think you mentioned if it is) then for a handy trick, leave a vulnerable point on the finished object that can be reinforced with a secondary piece. Then when you want a different object, remove the secondary piece and break that vulnerable point.  For hunter-gatherers and especially [endurance hunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_hunting) this would be a good way to minimize carrying weight.  You can use the object for all of your tools by having practiced all the needed shapes in advance and then rapidly breaking and reshaping to switch between tools.

    For a primitive tool, the atlatl would be good one.  It is simpler than a bow and provides a good boost to spear throwing.

    For making a bow, you want a nonuniform tension/flexibility... [composite bows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_bow) typically use a lamination of wood, sinew, and horn.  If you can control the properties across the bow to within the range of wood without having any weak-points at the interface where properties change (or better yet smoothly change the properties), you could probably manage a bow better than the best composite bows.  Imagine archers with bows at the overall force of an English longbow but the size/compactness and nice recurve of a composite bow.  A culture that can teach its citizen to shape their ball into a bow with these specs and train them to develop a good draw strength will have a huge military advantage.

    For other tools... I am not sure how much better an obsidian knife or [Macuahuitl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl) is for having the handle perfectly fit around the obsidian and just leave the very edge exposed, by I suspect it would be a decent improvement on it, but not enough to replace bronze or iron.

    Having a material that can fill a space, and then become immaterial and disappear from that space, has huge implications on materials manufacturing and many other industries. You can create perfect vacuums without a significant power source. You can make molds that disappear after the hardening process. You can make load-bearing objects that disappear on a mental trigger.

    Can you make fibrous, flexible shapes like rope?

      Good points. You could also use this as a pump to gradually compress air by initially making a huge ball and then reshaping the ball to make it smaller and smaller. You could then use the compressed air source as a scuba tank, a power source for an [air gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gun) or cannon, as an explosive device, or as a heat exchanger since the gas will heat up when being compressed and cool down again when it's allowed to depressurize.

    > Could you make a bow, if you had a string for it? ... probably?

    How much can you transfigure against tension? Could you e.g. make a crossbow, attach the string and pass it through a hook, and then reshape it to move the hook back so that it's drawn? If that's too hard you might be able to break it down in multiple easier steps, with pulley, *ratchet and whatnot.

    Leaving aside this combat application, that would also make it a possible source of energy, depending on where the reshaping energy comes from. [New job: just levitate and drop your ball over and over again.](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2011-07-13)

    I'm mainly curious about the applications of reshaping. If you practice two different shapes, could you reshape from one to the other a lot faster or more forcefully? If that's the case, you could have all sorts of tools developed on the principle of rapid reshaping to cycle between shapes rather than having moving parts, with the additional benefit that any wear to the objects would be immediately fixed with the next cycle. For example, memorising the shape of a jackhammer at minimum and full extension, then moving between them quickly to produce the same effect

    If ball is non material, can I materialize it inside my enemy body, maybe even inside his heart, instantly killing him?

    What happens if I materialize ball, put it somewhere, and start running far away from it? Will it diseappear, or follow me just by flying (in material or non material form)?

    If I travel to mars, but leave my ball on Earth, and then I will 'call back' it to me on Mars, will it travel to Mars faster than light?

    A clipboard. Can the orb/object keep floating once formed into a shape?

    A basket for carrying things,  or a cart.  How much fine control does the average person have over material properties?  A low friction base would be useful for the nonfloaty version. 

    A mold for making other parts in a manufacturing environment,  especially for small quantity runs.  Material properties come into play again... does the shape change or become harder to control due to heat? Will the orb/object catch fire?

    Walls and stairs, scaffolding, ladders; short people no longer need to suffer the tyranny of ceiling mounted cabinets.

    A sphere which carries your valuables inside, which only opens when you reshape it into a fishbowl to take your stuff out.  Actually this brings up another question.  Can the orb be stolen if it'ssolid and floating behind you?

    Can I make it soft? My pillows are never the right height.

    Shoes.  Especially if you're poor.

    A chair wherever you happen to want to sit.

    An outfit. Can the color of the orb-object be controlled?  What about the texture? 

    A spoon or fork or knife, or a plate that's perpetually clean.  Can the object be a plate and utensils all connected by strings?



    Think of modern conveniences.  That's the main thing anybody would use it for.

  How should societies of fey who are ageless and able to make unbreakable vows leverage this to the greatest extent?

  The fey can't lie, and are incapable of not putting forth their greatest possible effort into upholding any promises they make. Fey contracts can't force non-fey to keep their end of any deal, and for that reason are always drafted with escape clauses. Fey have at least as much control over their body/mind as the best human meditators, but there are still some parts of their subconscious/nervous system they can't consciously control and contracts don't change this.

  To prevent the obvious slavery related exploits here, all fey when young bind themselves into promises limiting what they are capable of agreeing to/doing under duress. Certain kinds of promises are also obviously best made publicly, for instance: "I will never to give in to blackmail or ransoms and do everything in my power to kill anyone who tries such tactics against me". Not lying absolutely applies to "white lies", despite fey language being almost intrinsically impossible for humans to understand given its absurd amount of innuendo and multiple layers of meaning.

  **It strikes me that a species able to make perfect precommitment like these fey should have massive advantages in a staggering variety of areas compared to humans, but I've never seen this explored to its full potential.**

    Your anti-slavery method is insufficient.  Capture enemy fey babies, bind them with carefully worded oaths when they are old enough to speak, repeat with their babies and so on until you have an apartheid society with top level fey that take all the standard anti-slavery oaths as children, mid-tier fey that are mostly enslaved as a child with a few escape clauses to stop them from being carelessly destroyed by the top tier and to give them incentive to cooperate, and bottom caste fey that get brutally used freely with ridiculously horrific oaths forced on them as children.

    The control over their own body/mind can be used to enslave them even further by forcing them to use Pavlovian conditioning on themselves until they are willingly obedient and loyal. 

    The Fey don't need a lot of the cultural/societal technology that humans do to do stuff like go to war or organize on large scales, this might actually be a disadvantage in the long run, because they wouldn't develop institutions and conventions that are useful beyond the immediate needs they fulfill.

    Also can Fey hybridize with humans?  It seem like their may be room for exploits if part Fey can do stuff like pass for fey but not be bound by oaths, or pretend to be human and make secret Oaths to themselves.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      >Your anti-slavery method is insufficient.

      The fey have other protections from slavery by virtue of having more magical talent than nearly all humans and having children very rarely which they are more invested in. Fey societies are decently egalitarian for a few reasons: Fey society emerged in the Feywild isolated from non-fey and fey magical talent is such that they can live comfortably in the wilderness completely isolated from civilization. So fey societies had to start out as egalitarian because of the voluntary nature of citizenship. Fey birth rates are so low that food and other basic resources have also never been scarce for them. Having great foresight by virtue of their psychology/lifespan most fey have long since been binding themselves into an ancient compact to do everything in their power to destroy anyone attempting to enslave fey. So trying to kidnap fey kids means assassination attempts from the majority of powerful spellcasters in existence (who would never otherwise cooperate).

      >The control over their own body/mind can be used to enslave them even further by forcing them to use Pavlovian conditioning on themselves until they are willingly obedient and loyal.

      This probably wouldn't work for the same reasons brainwashing people who know what you're doing doesn't work in real life. Conditioning doesn't seem likely to have a dramatic effect if being self-applied by someone who actively wants it to fail.

      >Also can Fey hybridize with humans? It seem like their may be room for exploits if part Fey can do stuff like pass for fey but not be bound by oaths, or pretend to be human and make secret Oaths to themselves.

      They can hybridize with humans but essentially never do for cultural reasons. Fey intrinsically despise those who break contracts and lie (though they don't care as much about "white lies", though they consider them the mark of an inferior culture). Fey social etiquette is also so weird that non-fey will always be uncouth outsiders and this sort of incomprehensible etiquette always arises as a consequence of fey's alien psychology.      
      Anyway fey can't blend in well in human society without illusions (which human mages can detect) because they are all extremely attractive (or blatantly inhuman) and possessing of an otherworldly grace almost no human could hope to match through training. Fey also have vulnerability to cold iron (metal not significantly heated within the earth/feywilds magnetic/magical field) which is the only way to disable their powers. This is important because otherwise fey empires would have no reliable way of imprisoning criminals. These empires produce essentially all cold iron (which requires magical space stations) and forbid giving it to non-fey upon pain of death.

        Wait, so the only way they could think of to make iron that never wound up both hot and in a planet's magnetic field was to build blast furnaces in space? Bruh.

        **A vengeful human's procedure for making cold iron-plated weapons:**

        1. Take some normal iron, some lump of metal that is not necessarily iron but can be, some sort of very acidic solution (concentrated vinegar and lemon juice are both excellent choices, but oleum might be a bit excessive and need substantial dilution), two corrosion-resistant wires with alligator clips or something, and the (metallic) weapon to be coated.
        2. Attach one end of wire one to the unspecified metal lump and one end to the weapon 
        3. Attach one end of wire two to the iron and leave the other one hanging.
        4. Prepare two acid baths: one with the iron and the weapon submerged, the other with the metal and the exposed wire submerged.
        5. Wait. Iron should build up on the weapon's surface. 

        This is basically just an electroplating rig set up to a crude battery. As electrons are pulled from the iron, it enters the solution as iron ions. In this phase, it is chemically distinct from actual iron; if you boiled the solution, you'd get an iron salt, not iron itself. As electrons are pushed into the weapon, some combine with iron ions, forming new iron atoms. These iron atoms have never been exposed to high temperatures at all and thus count as cold iron. The cold iron plating only increases in thickness with more time in the electroplater.

        Though electroplating was invented in the early 19^th century on Earth, the principle [was likely understood](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery) as early as classical times, and of course the inhabitants of your setting have a strong incentive to develop and weaponize it...

      Yeah fey society has some fundamental differences due to immortality and the fact fey can live comfortably in the wilderness just fine. That being said nearly all fey are fairly clever, with the most powerful ones being peak-human intelligence (which at least for qualitative intelligence is the max within my setting).      
      I should also note that massive numbers of hunter gatherers from surprisingly large geographic areas were banding together to build large (presumably) religious structures well before agriculture, so agriculture isn't the be all and end all of mass scale cooperation. 

      Many paths to civilization are likely possible without people relying on state for their survival, though they may not resemble our civilizations much. The existence of a minuscule fraction of fey who are individually equal in power to an entire army of average fey is also going to be a major factor here, though to what end I can't be confident.

    One of the most interesting consequences that might arise from this is an extremely important social role that is basically a genuine "benevolent dictator", that swear an extremely complex and restrictive system of oaths that bind them to extreme epistemic standards, and requiring any order they give to be *proven* beneficial to all of fey-kind to some very high standard, and also swearing genuine 100% benevolence and selflessness etc. and before they can be given this status they must swear a bunch of oaths proving that the initial state is not pathological. In return, *every* fey would swear to follow *any* order from this role.

    Since the fey is given up their free will, and has to act *maximally selflessly*, and spend centuries or millennia with maximally efficient scholarship and calculations, effectively being a slave, this might be a temporary state with a term length of say 1000 years. Only the most altruistic that felt the calling, or who needed to atone for something horrific, would do it. Still, at any given time there'd be a fair amount of them, and no concept of jurisdiction, since the oaths are designed to work with Aumann's agreement theorem. The aesthetic styling would be more shoolars, wisemen, and shamans than leaders of any kind. 

    Probably the most important things they' do is study the subtleties of how oaths work, and writing lawbook-length oath systems that all fey can swear safely. But they'd also make most of the stuff here redundant; you don't need a *specific* oath against slavery if this social role exists to give an order to do the mass attacking, and it'd unlike lots of individual contingency oaths work for arbitrary unforeseen threats or when multiple threats have to be prioritized.

    After a few thousand years of this, I'd expect the end result to look a lot like a single hivemind piloting multiple bodies, or at least a completely eusocial species. At the limit, exactly EVERY positive-sum interaction would happen, and no zero sum or negative-sum ones. Basically, all fey would have an exactly identical oath of maximizing utility according to something akin to the species coherent extrapolated volition, although probably implemented in a roundabout way rather than an actual number or any of those terms it would be mathematically isomorphic. As it is a highest-priority oath, and no two actions ever have the exact same expected utility, it effectively screens of all possibility of making further oaths and any other influence on their decisions of every kind.

    In [Silmarillion-based glowfics](https://www.glowfic.com/boards/18), this is how Melkor retains control over his orc armies. Get the first-generation orcs to swear obedience to you (in this fanon orcs retain the canon elves' ability to swear seemingly unbreakable oaths), then order them to make all their future children swear the same as soon as they're old enough to speak, and bam, self-sustaining slave population. 

    The Silmarillion itself, of course, is a bit of a cautionary tale about careless oaths. To a first approximation, basically every evil act ever committed by an elf in all of history is a consequence of the [Oath of Fëanor](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Oath_of_F%C3%ABanor)

    There is also a fairyland glowfic setting (can't find an archetypical thread, [it's a bit of a mess in there](https://www.glowfic.com/characters/3?view=posts)) where anyone who knows your true name or feeds you food can give you orders.

      This form of unbreakable vow is very conducive to creating dystopian hells, which is why I tried to specify the initial conditions as egalitarian (since I wanted to explore scenarios where this ability makes most fey better off). Since it's essentially impossible to break out of such a dystopian hell once it forms. Though the inverse is also true, since if things start as egalitarian everyone can agree to vows that bind them against anyone who tries to create such a dystopia.

        >Even with the additional constraints and initial condition vasudrake describes in response, it still seems like it is one clever and cruel leader from sliding into dystopian horror.

        It's essentially a matter of which oaths spread first, because there are multiple stable equilibria.    
        I don't think the dystopian hell scenario is very likely to emerge for fey from an egalitarian hunter gatherer starting point though (which is the default if this trait is genetic).          
        If the nearby hunter gatherer fey see an early city state growing rapidly in power through slavery they have the foresight to know that kind of power will snowball. So any empire trying to utilize this kind of slavery is likely to be rapidly crushed by overwhelming numbers of other fey, who are after all clever and forward thinking.

        Once most everyone is bound to destroy would-be fey enslavers then that equilibrium should be stable indefinitely unless there's some outside party which can afford to go to war with nearly all fey.

          On the other hand, upon discovery of a loophole in a dystopian oath, society instantly dissolves into bloody revolt, while in an utopian one people just voluntarily fix it.

            I wasn't proposing any utopian oaths by any stretch of the imagination.        

            The oaths described serve two purposes: Making it irrational to try to blackmail, torture for information, ransom your loved one's, etc to you. The second purpose is that anti-slavery oaths act as a form of mutual defense to ensure no faction of fey can gain an overwhelming advantage by enslaving fey, which would rapidly snowball.

            >On the other hand, upon discovery of a loophole in a dystopian oath, society instantly dissolves into bloody revolt, while in an utopian one people just voluntarily fix it.

            I should note that dystopian oaths needn't by at all vulnerable to loopholes since oaths rely on the judgement of those bound. So you can include "acting loyally" in a contract, thus disallowing any actions the slave knows would probably be considered disloyal.

      Fey aren't capable of making oaths they don't intend to keep, which rules out contradictory oaths. The oaths don't exist outside the Fey's mind either (thus they often have clauses preventing deliberate mind control) so it just relies on how they understand the contract (and they can't agree to contracts they don't understand fully).

        What if they swore oath #2 while very drunk and not remembering (or misremembering) oath #1? Or what if the memory of oath #1 is surgically removed from their brain, and reattached after #2?

        What if oaths #1 and #2 appeared compatible at the time, but later prove themselves incompatible? 

        What if #1 and #2 are not *absolutely logically incompatible* but just both draw on your personal resources such that you sometimes have to (consciously or not) choose one to prioritise? As an extreme example, taking your "do everything in my power to kill anyone who tries such tactics against me" in its strictest sense would prevent you from swearing any other oath related to your future actions, because possibly someday you'll have to drop ***everything*** to go on a murder quest.

          You can absolutely circumvent many oaths through mind control/memory manipulation, but fey intrinsically despise such behavior (both the prospect of doing it themselves, as well as anyone who actually does it) and all serious contracts are drafted to make this as difficult as possible (since you'd need to wipe your memory before taking the oath and then have somebody prepared to surprise and mind control you afterwards despite you after taking the oath making great efforts to avoid this).

          Fey have eidetic memory for their oaths and a superhuman innate ability to foresee oath conflicts, because this trait is so central to their psychology. They are also incapable of making oaths they aren't confident they understand, which by instinct they never are if seriously impaired. They consequently can't make _logically_ incompatible oaths, because oaths only exist within one's mind so erasing it from memory _is_ erasing the oath, they aren't magic just a consequence of fey psychology. 

          When it comes to oaths which compete with each other for time/resources one usually prioritizes oaths through their design. For instance the oaths used to prevent one from being enslaved/coerced are made before all other oaths and disallow the creation of any future oaths which take priority over them. Thus there is generally a hierarchy of types of contract people will be bound under. I should note the example used in my question was overly simplified because all the contracts tend to be extremely lengthy having undergone intense scrutiny, with fey preferring to stick to preexisting well studied contracts whenever possible. Similarly nearly all contracts except the highest priority ones have escape clauses to limit their cost in the event of unforeseen consequences.      
          On occasions when one contract doesn't take clear priority over another however one is compelled to act in the way that balances them "equally" (which is a subjective judgement), but fey hate that sort of ambiguous room for interpretation and try to avoid such scenarios.

    Seems like oath hackers would be a thing.  People who can figure out the exact limitations of a captive's birth-oath, then find loopholes to force them to swear slave-oaths anyway, then make them forget the captivity and save-oaths ever happened, and eventually take over the world.

    The whole list of "swear to always feel intense discomfort and self-loathing when working against my wishes" type oaths can't be counter-oathed against, especially by a child who barely understands what is happening.

      I don't think this is terribly feasible with well crafted oaths. Since you can have oaths rely on the interpretation of the the bound individual, so you can literally just exclude the possibility of accepting any clearly exploitative oaths (and fey are superhumanly good at foreseeing the consequences of their oaths), as well as oaths that would never be accepted except under coercion. 

      >"swear to always feel intense discomfort and self-loathing when working against my wishes"

      This kind of oath wouldn't be possible, because people can't force themselves to feel negative emotions in this way. Especially when doing so is so obviously against one's own interests (also see my comment about why extreme operant conditioning based brainwashing doesn't work).

          Being able to make yourself feel bad about something you _know_ you shouldn't (in every sense of the word) feel bad about isn't something it seems like any humans are capable of regardless of meditation. For similar reasons to why people can't make themselves believe something they consider absurd.

          >Sounds like you're adding new rules after the fact.

          I haven't introduced any new rules, or even changed my interpretation of any previously established rules in response to your comment. I wasn't clear about exactly how specific oaths need to be, but that was clarified both by the example I gave and by multiple comments I made before yours. 

          The idea that fey would necessarily make many slightly ambiguous oaths that take advantage of fey's lack of ability for self deception (as a consequence of their inability to lie) to function was always part of the scenario I was imagining here. When you can literally include clauses about acting in accordance with what one believes to have been the intended interpretation of an oath, that unavoidably places limits on certain types of exploits against any well thought through oath.

  New Age Munchkinry!  Munchkin various miscellaneous magic powers based on rationalizations of New Age practices.  Munchkin one of them or mix and match.  Treat as a single unique power you possess, or consider the societal implications if anyone can learn them.

  **Homeopathy**

  * By performing a few various ritual actions (mixing/shaking it a particular way, saying prayer to various neopagan deities, meditating on water memory, etc.) as you dilute a substance with water, you can allow the water to retain the full potency of the original substance, so long as you or another Homeopath are the one to administer it.
  * With moderate practice, the potency of the water will automatically adjust such that it gives the optimal dosage of the substance.
  * With a lot of practice, you can allow the water to have only the beneficial properties of the original substance and none of the side-effects, up to the maximum non-lethal dosage.
  * For all other purposes save ingesting, the water is just water.

  **Crystal Healing/Energy Worker**

  * By moving crystal and magnets over a persons body, you can heal some aliments.
  * Practice will improve ability, but some things are easily healed and others are relatively unaffected.
  * Careful study will show that the crystals/magnets are actually only affecting bio-electricity, albeit in a precisely optimal way (in proportion to the Healer's skill) towards maximizing the subject's health.

  **Aura Vision**

  * By concentrating on a person, you can visualize their Aura, seeing a mix of various translucent color and shades around them.
  * The colors are meaningful, but unfortunately, they have too much information: the color coding mixes colors for emotions, colors for thoughts, and colors for physical condition/health.  Furthermore, every person has slight variations on the standard color scheme.
  * For example one persons dark red might mean anger and another persons dark red might mean irritation.  And red might also indicate good blood flow and/or aggressive thoughts.
  * Lots of practice might mean some limited discernment between similar looking colors that correspond to different things.

  **Astrology/Palm Reading/Tarot/Other Divination**

  * By working a divination ritual (i.e. Tarot, Astrology, etc.) on a person with their consent, you can generate a reading that the person will feel is very detailed, accurate, and personal at the time it is read to them.
  * In actuality, the reading will only have actual accurate information as is absolutely necessary to induce that feeling in the person being read.  For the most part and/or to a objective outside observer, the reading will be vague guesswork with a few bits of accurate information.

    Homeopathy + Telemedicine = Win. Have multiple uber-skilled homeopaths infusing water with all the beneficial effects of all drugs in existence (no reason not to do it if there are no side effects), deliver the infused water via water supply. If anyone needs any healing, it can be done at home at any moment, you just need to play a video of the most uber homeopath providing instructions on how to drink the water. There actually were attempts to "charge" water over television IRL, so these beliefs don't necessarily involve personal presence.

    Food is a substance (under the homeopathic definition at least, which counts stuff like goose liver as a substance), while calories, taste, vitamins and their texture are all properties of said food. Hungry? Go down and get a homeopathic cup of burger.

    Aura readers would become security guards, bouncers and cops. To get into a place you would have to pass an aura test, and if your Aura is naturally the wrong shade of red or blue or black? Cops are going to be stopping you every time they see you, leading to aura discrimination for people that just have bad auras.

    If it was around long enough I could also see it being used as probable cause or evidence "Your honor, the suspect had a burgundy charcoal aura, so I knew he had just murdered someone."

    Homeopathy can be exploited for an infinite supply of any substance that can be formed by a reaction with the body. For an example, say you want infinite silver chloride (presumably to refine into the pure metal). Homeopathically transfer the properties of silver nitrate to some water (with the intended effect of "make the drinker poop out AgCl"—it should form the insoluble salt when reacting with stomach acid) and have your subject drink up, then collect their feces and get the show on the road. As a bonus, "acute nitrate poisoning" and "loss of chloride ions in stomach fluid" are definitely negative side effects, so you can have them drink as much of this water as you want without exhausting their stomach acid or killing them.

    Other ideas:
    Hydrogen: infuse with the essence of a colloidal magnesium suspension
    Sugar: infuse with the essence of starch. (Similar methods should exist for all nutrients)
    Oxygen: infuse with the essence of hydrogen peroxide
    NaOH (useful not just for its alkalinity but also as a carbon sink): infuse with the essence of sodium
    ...and so on and so forth

  Forking Sextet

  - You wake up with the ability to "fork" into 6 separate bodies, each with a copy of your mind. 

  - Every time you go to sleep, your mind is copied 5 times and into 5 bodies (plus your old original one remains). 

  - you can "absorb" copies and merge them with the original mind. You can do that consciously, or wait until both the original body and the copies fall asleep, then it happens automatically. Same happens if the copy dies.

  - if you consciously absorb a copy, its body disappears. 

  - your mind merges seamlessly, with forks' memories queueing in order of falling asleep.

  - for the sake of the argument, the copies appear naked, and are: You (original), Older You, Cute You, Ugly You, Cute Sex-reversed You, Ugly Sex-Reversed You.
