  I haven't seen much of Person of Interest. Has anybody here been watching?

    I've seen up until the first few episodes of the latest season. For a weekly formula show, it was really, *really* good for the first three seasons. People didn't hold the idiot ball as a general rule, most of the tech made sense (there is occasional  lapses where things just...don't work that way) but for the most part, probably one of the closest shows to "rational" on air ATM (note: not rationalist. Rational)

    Then we come to the latest season. 

    For those who don't spend their time on certain subreddits where AI intelligence is discussed with regularity, it probably seems like a pretty good approximation. But it still has a procedure to follow, and procedures...don't hold up to true AI well. There come multiple points where it's just like "if you can think that, so can they - and they thought of this *literally as soon as this information was available to them.*"

    As a TV show? 9/10, I should really catch up on this season. One of my favorites. As a realistic depiction of a battle between AIs? 2/10. [Samaritan](#s " should have won a week out of the gate. It has far less limitations than the Machine, and has a much broader support network. These aren't two gods playing with the same deck of cards - one of them has jokers.")

      But they don't go into much detail with the AIs so you can more or less just come up with your own story of why stuff is happening the way it is. 

      [](#s "We know that the machine has been working on self preservation in the background. So it doesn't seem that implausible that it's able to do enough despite its restrictions to maintain the stalemate we see, it did have a huge head start after all.")

      ```
      [I think](#s " the main disadvantage Samaritan has is that it's massively less efficient than the Machine.  We know that it required the absolute latest hardware, where the Machine seems to be running on commodity VMs at this point.")

      >if you can think that, so can they - and they thought of this literally as soon as this information was available to them.

      I know many people in the lesswrong-o-sphere subscribe the FOOM hypothesis, but do we *have* to say that the AI immediately becomes perfectly rational? I think it's okay to just say that it's pretty smart and getting smarter... 

      I don't think it's reasonable to believe in FOOM to the extent that fiction in which mostly-better-than-human AI occurs but is not automatically ridiculously, instantaneously, overpoweringly over good at everything in the realms of intelligence and creativity becomes unrealistic.

    I've seen a few episodes. The plots were interesting, but the main character really irritated me for some reason. He was just such a generic Gruff McTuff with an ambiguously tragic past.
