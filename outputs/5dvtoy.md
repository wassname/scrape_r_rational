## Just finished reading a really epic scene from Dungeon Keeper Ami

### Post:

I just finished reading "Divine Opposition Part 2". OMG it was so epic. I loved the part where [Spoiler](#s "Keeper Mercury uses a giant electromagnet behind a wall to trap the Avatar. And the ensuing negotiations with the Light Gods was really cool too.")

For those who haven't read Dungeon Keeper Ami, it's a crossover between Sailor Moon and Dungeon Keeper. Dungeon Keeper is a game where you play as an evil overlord boss character called a 'Keeper', build your dungeon and defend it from heroes and from other Keepers. In Dungeon Keeper Ami, Sailor Mercury gets transported to the world of Dungeon Keeper and accidentally becomes a Keeper. She then has to fight against other Keepers, protect her dungeons from the local good guys, try to find a way to get her soul back from the Dark Gods and get back home while causing as little collateral damage as possible. All of this without letting the forces of evil find out she's not on their side and futilely attempting to convince the forces of good that she is on *their* side.

It features a genuinely intelligent Sailor Mercury (Mizuno Ami), who, aside from getting her intelligence upgraded from informed to genuine, is still entirely consistent with her characterization in the original Sailor Moon anime.

  Yeah, that was definitely one of my favorite parts, of an altogether too  excellent series. the beginning is a bit rough, but it has genuinely intelligent characters, great worldbuilding, and (mostly) intelligent opponents like Mukrezar. 
  There is also a rewrite/sanctioned fanfiction going on- it's IMO better written than the beginning of DKA, so I have high hopes, but it isn't at the level of recent chapters yet.

  *(sorry, don’t remember spoilers’ chapters)*

  The scene from that story that stayed with me was [when](#s "she weaponised the sacrificial altar she’d built and turned it into an on-touch activated soul sucking mine.")

  p.s. She [stupidly](#s "lost the cape though.")

    ah crap i shouldn't have looked. i wish you did remember the spoilers' chapters. that definitely wasn't before the part with the avatar fight. it must have been at some point after...
