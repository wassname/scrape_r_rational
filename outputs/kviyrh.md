  Fucking FINALLY! It's taken far too long and far too many revelations, but Ana's finally starting to think that maybe Paragon isn't all it's cracked up to be. It's a shame it took so long, especially since she's coming to this realization immediately after she helped foil Commonplace's revolution, but I'll take what I can get.

  This place definitely seems like it's some sort of representation of Grace's mind. The sun being the same color as the lightning of her pith, the flashbacks to important moments in her life, the environment as a whole (the electric fence, the factory, the watchtowers) being reminiscent of the Shenti redemption camp, etc. Hell, when we first glimpsed this place back in [chapter 8-D](https://pithserial.com/2020/08/18/8-d-grace/) the factory was constantly rebuilding itself, which sounds to me like a metaphor for her vocation. I'm not sure what exactly it means that Grace has a door in her submarine that lets people physically enter her mind, where she got it, or what she uses it for, but that definitely seems to be what it is.

  Grace's magic door being front and center here makes me hopeful that some of the weird background elements of the story might be moving into the foreground. There are a lot of things that are really fucking strange about this world or about the events that have occurred that have just sort of been lurking there without too much commentary, and they've slowly been piling up while the revolutionary drama has been getting most of the attention. The lack of stars, whatever happened to Tasia's sister, the rising ocean and how apparently the water gets *weird* if you go too deep, the oracle snakes, the pit in Buttercup Lodge, the guy who freed Maxine Clive, etc. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy the politics and the revolutionary plotline, but the more this weird stuff gets hinted at the more curious I get about it, so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that it gets the spotlight now that the revolution has had its climax and Ana's (FINALLY) having a change of heart.

  I'm so satisfied, that's a really good explanation of the [weird cost structure issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/k4bdt2/11d_max_pith/gecemht/?context=3) with body production I opined on a few chapters ago.

  I want to steel man Cuthbert Benthey's argument, because right now he sounds whiny.  Even if you believe that elitists only want to keep their power because it makes them feel special, they rarely say it in those words. I know it's hard to make an argument while being threatened with death, but the following version should be basically cached.

  The stronger form of the argument goes like this (note that I am not endorsing this argument -- but this is what Benthey should actually say):

  1. Humdrums are idiots.  Look at the morons they elect to Parliament.  We are the cream of society, raised since birth to rule.   They listen to talk radio.   We have ousting to get rid of the unfit.
  2. It's too dangerous to give Humdrums power. Look at what happened when they got machine guns!  They went and invented trench warfare.  We have the Treaty of Silence to reduce the horrors of war.  If we tell Humdrums about projection, so will the Shenti and everyone else.  Imagine how terrible war would be if projectors fought.  War is Hell.  War with Palefire is unimaginably worse. 
  3. We, Paragon, use Nudging as a tool of last resort.  As you learned in your first week at Paragon Academy, it's already saved our entire country on six separate occasions.  If everyone had the power to Nudge, we would have to teach everyone to resist it (to stop the vast number of unspeakable crimes which would otherwise be committed).  And then we would lose that tool.  And the next time some demagogue came along, the country would be toast.

  It feels like Ana's potential in this story kind of got spent early on, and that her arc has been... well, stretched, for a while, and now is the chapter where it can finally progress at a normal pace again.

  (unless she dies; please don't die, Ana, you can still become a butterfly!)

  I'm not just talking about her morality problems, by the way. Her body keeps decaying somehow without stopping her from performing high-intensity James Bond theatrics; recently she commented that she was medically expected to be dead weeks ago, and that feels like a meta point.

  Same thing with her illusions. A big part of early Pith was the constant escalation between her learning to use her vocation better, and her enemies trying new countermeasures. But it feels like ever since she's been outed from Paragon nobody tries to defend against her anymore. At multiple points she asks people questions that her assumed identity has absolutely no reason to be asking, which earlier in the story would have gotten her busted fast, and now the bad guys roll with it, even in Tunnel Vision's own sub.

  I still like the story and especially this chapter, mind you. I just hope that now that Ana's initial arc is over the story keeps its momentum going. A lot of the non-Ana characters (Max, Tunnel Vision, Wes) have shown that the story can still pump out interesting ideas outside of the initial concept.

  Ooooh... oh boy. Man, as if Paragon wasn't desperately asking for a dick in the eye before, they just come out and start spouting off like this.

  When people hear that shit straight from the horses mouth... [well...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viUnzgXPrDg&t=7s)

    It's a great story, but the odd morality is probably the most consistently difficult thing. Anna not taking a body never really makes much sense, she's headshotting dudes and stuff. She could also, which would make more sense, steal one, they're doing missions that are like 100 times more dangerous then stealing a body at this point, and the morality issue is really not there. Being a sub rosa counterrevolutionary with so many moral qualms seems pretty impossible, at some point early on you'd either give up because everything you do is inconsistent with your morality or just start acting from pragmatism. On the same issue, her body breaking down even more every chapter kind of loses its shine, it feels like she should have just died by now, or at least not be able to run around doing missions.

    The interludes tend to be better in this story because the main story has to deal wtih these issues, but in general I still think it's great, and does some stuff perfectly that no other story does.

      Think the story would be so much better if Ana was just edited out.

        Hard disagree.

        Her arc was stretched a lot, but she has good moments.
