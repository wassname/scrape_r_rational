### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4m41h1/biweekly_challenge_power_failure/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Power Failure". The winner was /u/space_fountain with their story, [Europe Down](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4m41h1/biweekly_challenge_power_failure/d439lms). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/space_fountain!

##### This Time

Next time, we'll be doing [Space Battles](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceBattle)! Battles! In Spaaaaaace! This is a great time to break out that humongous mecha story you've been thinking about, or a hard sci-fi tale of ships shooting lasers at each other from hundreds of kilometers away. The only requirement is that there needs to be battle, and it needs to be in space. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, June 29th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights. Five-time winners get even more special winner flair, and their choice of prompt if they want it.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

It's been one year since the first /r/rational challenge, discounting a few earlier proto-challenges. I think it's appropriate for us to go back and do a twist on [that first challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3a7ypf/weekly_challenge_portal_fantasy/); the theme will be "Reverse Portal Fantasy". If a portal fantasy is where someone from our world steps into another, then a reverse portal fantasy is where someone from another world steps into ours. Of course, this is entirely a matter of perspective, since one character's portal fantasy is another's reverse portal fantasy, but the intent here is to get stories about fantastical people stepping into the mundane world. Feel free to try out whatever variations you'd like though.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 6/29.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread will be up shortly.

    Really like this one, good job :D

    Why does rez-adjusting destroy your object permanence though?

      Thank you!

      Because of the placement of the various regions of the brain that in influences, to change your perception of time, overlap somewhat with the regions that interpret sensory data.
