  Interesting chapter. The whole romantic matter really bothered me. Doesn't Cato have any sexual drive at all?

    I've known people who are asexual but still capable of romance. Didn't seem very unusual to me in 2016, but maybe in Inath it'll be a little more unconventional and odd. But then again, they're an engineer from another world and a magical mad scientist, so maybe everyone else will just put it up to their usual shenanicanery.

  With the required precision complains by the workers... they need to make pre-made holes & stoppers so that everything WILL be placed right where it needs to be.
