## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  What's the key to a cozy, pastoral, slice-of-life setting? My own personal list is a lack of crime, lack of coordination problems, general friendliness of inhabitants, disconnection from the wider world, lots of personalities, traditions, customs, and hyperlocal cultures ... but I'm wondering if I'm missing something.

  Edit: Thanks for the suggestions/feedback, it's helped me firm up the genre in my mind.

    If you consume any fantasy geared towards kids between 10-13 (so, not YA, but not quite kiddie books either), you'll notice something very particular. The protagonists, despite their age and lack of planning, have significant independence and control over their own life. Take ash ketchum as the prototypical example-- he's out, gallivanting across the entire world. But that's not to say the protagonists never deal with adults or other authority figures. But instead of controlling the main character's journey, these characters are invariably less "mom and dad" and more "aunts and uncles." The protagonist always finds a kindly family willing to let them sleep in their barn, or a wise mentor to teach them tips and tricks for the road. Ash ketchum finds brock and misty, and receives guidance from other adults he encounters across his travels.

    It's not simply that people are friendly, but that everyone seems to be willing to go a little out of their way to help each other. It's never awkward to talk to strangers because, even if you don't have anything in common, they always seem to think of you like a little cousin or nephew. You don't miss them overmuch when they're gone, since they're not nuclear family, but it's always nice to see them again when you stumble across them a few months later.

    That, I think, is the core of what makes Ghibli films ghibli films. Not every character may *like* the main character, but, potentially excluding major villains, even dislike tends to be of the sort a grumpy old aunt or rivalrous cousin has for you. See *Spirited Away's* Zeniba, or even sort of the relationship Nausicaä has with the female antagonist. Everything feels familial, and even life-threatening conflicts can feel cozy and personal.

    Lack of economic pressure/hardship.  Low-work hours required to get by comfortably.  For anyone living modestly, part-time jobs are enough and anyone with bigger ambitions is able to make their passion into a viable job.

    I’m thinking of My Little Pony as the ideal example of this.  In MLP the main characters all get by mostly just doing what they like.  They either make their passions into jobs or work part time at other jobs and still have plenty of time leftover.  In the early seasons their lives are relatively unhurried and relaxed.  In later seasons helping Twilight with various official jobs takes up more of their time, but even then they make time for their other hobbies and interests.  In Equestrian overall, various magics make life easier and it seems like ponies are able to achieve self actualization in making their special talents useful.

    Judging by /r/CozyPlaces, where it seems the one element of coziness that's more important than soft things, earth tones, and yellow-tinted lights is a window showing either snow or a downpour, it seems like coziness is partly defined by being protected from unpleasant things, distinct from the absence of those things.

    I don't think that you need to hole your cozy place up in a bubble in a dystopia, but you need some sort of unpleasantness that you can take a break from. If it's supposed to be an idyllic world, then that has to be something situationally unpleasant, like a loud party that you need a break from. Like you go out of your way to design an overly boisterous parade just so people have an excuse to hide in coffee bars when they're partied out.

    Books, people playing games\*, helping neighbors out, possibly less atomic socially (or atomism used to create the perfect less atomic situations), nice weather, maybe both things to do at times, and times when there's nothing pressing to do. Perhaps some positive connection to the wider world (like regular trade with a sister city), etc.

    \*Perhaps ritual conflict, but injuries aren't too serious, and no (really) hard feelings. ("This year our team is finally going to beat their team!" "And if they don't?" "Then we'll congratulate them/all get drunk together afterwards/complain together about the refs and the calls in the game all night long.")

    In my personal opinion, Food. Feasts and special meals and lots of cooking always makes slice-of-life more fun for me. Something about the ability to spend time on something that people enjoy but doesn't really matter lets me know that everything must be amazing in their world.

    Some way of minimising unpleasant labour? Say, the town is built on particularly fertile land, and they have several good-tasting, easy-to-grow crops?
    ```

  - u/Norseman2:
    ```
    A lot of this comes down to simply having a small population in a remote and geographically-isolated region. Ideally, you'd be looking at a population equal to or less than [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number).

    Imagine a small town of about 150 people on the Alaskan coastline, or a fishing village on a tiny Hawaiian island. Having a small, isolated community like this means that relationships with one another are very important, and anything that would harm those relationships is not likely to be done, if it's even feasible. For example, theft of most types of property tends to be pointless. If you steal anything, everyone in town is going to hear about it and no one would buy it from you. Food and other consumables might be another matter, but everyone would suspect you if you don't have a job so you can make money legitimately. Your relationships matter, but property, not so much.

    To stretch this concept though, you might be able to achieve the same sort of feeling even in an extreme urban context if you had mostly self-sustained and semi-isolated arcologies. Imagine Earth in the year 14,500 A.D. With a global population now measured at about two trillion (assuming 1% population growth per 25 years), power is provided through immense nuclear fusion power plants, and we're using a *ton* of power for cooling (average air temperature is a scorching 80°C), cleaning CO2 scrubbers (since the outside air would be fatal with its 10% CO2 content), and providing power for grow lamps to produce food (since there's no unoccupied land to grow on anymore, even if the temperature would permit it). Everyone has to remain inside largely self-sufficient temperature- and atmosphere-controlled buildings; arcologies.

    One of the major challenges with such a large population is that infectious diseases can be absurdly difficult to manage. Viruses occasionally mutate as they spread, but with a population of two trillion, a virus that spreads widely will mutate at an absurdly fast rate and become almost impossible to stop. As a result, many of the UN semi-autonomous administrative zones are under near-permanent quarantine. Every 40 days, arcologies that have gone disease-free for the full duration may allow members in and out as they please. Of course, during these prolonged quarantine periods, people often build good relationships with their fellow arcology members and end up choosing to stay long-term, and many arcologies choose to voluntarily extend their quarantine period if they remain concerned about diseases. Once again, you have a close-knit community in a cozy (albeit cramped) environment where property doesn't matter much, the outside world is blocked off, and relationships are everything.

  I want to make an RPG that includes mechanics for memory erasure (sci fi), but it's really awkward coming up with design pillars. 

  One big part of the game is asymmetrical knowledge of rules between players and GM, so I can keep a lot of the rules mysterious so as not to allow players to gather undue hints from the rules the GM has to follow. That problem is summarily dealt with.

  The most important rule: If the players have experienced it, then their characters remember it. It can't be erased unless the GM has a plan for them to regain that memory soon. However, you can skip over scenes or tell them in a 'retelling' frame. This means that the characters are talking about that scene after it happened, but the players are experiencing that scene for the first time. This also gives the GM freedom to say that they don't recall certain things, or they remembered it wrong.

  I have some big problems with this setup though, if you have ideas to solve them, please help.

  1. Stories in RPGs can be really hard to write if you're bouncing forward and backward on the timeline. I can somewhat solve this by having a designated set of rules for the 'retelling' frame so that it doesn't bleed into parts of story writing that would be difficult.
  2. When the GM skips over something because 'your memory was erased of the event.' The GM has to decide how the players acted during that time. And though that version of themselves was killed and replaced with a rollback, the player might still feel betrayed.
  3. In the retelling frame, the scene still has to end the way it actually ended in the past, but the players still have freedom to choose how they acted during that scene. This is a clear incongruity, and I don't think players would like RPing when they know the ending result of the scene.
  ```

  - u/Papa-Walrus:
    ```
    Can I ask what you're hoping to accomplish by handling the memory erasure this way? Like, what kinds of scenes are the memory wipes going to happen in/after and how would skipping the scene and coming back later be more enjoyable than playing it the normal way?

    Because points #2 and #3 are...pretty much unsolvable, assuming that your players enjoy having control of their characters and their effect on the world. They can be minimized by making any skipped scene as short/inconsequential as possible and/or by limiting how much of the "new" world the players see in between regaining control and the "retelling" of the lost time, so that anything outside of what they see can still be changed by their actions during the "retelling." But no matter what, every time you do a memory wipe, you're violating your players' agency, the only difference is how much you violate it.

    Another problem I see is that the way you've laid it out make the memory wipes either inconsequential (because the players experience the scene, so there has to be a plan to regain the memory soon), or inevitable (you can't skip a scene that ends with memory erasure if the players might be able to avoid the memory erasure by their actions in said scene). The inconsequential memory wipes seems like a total waste of time (why bother if it changes nothing?), and the inevitable memory wipes seem like they would take a lot of fun out of the game for your players, because control of their characters and their effect on the world could be taken out of their hands at any moment without anything they can do about it. Neither wastes of time nor inevitably getting screwed are very fun mechanics.

    This is not to say that I don't think you can have mechanics involving memory wipes. I think your problems all come back to "The most important rule: If the players have experienced it, then their characters remember it." Trusting that your players can and will keep player knowledge and character knowledge separate is, in my eyes, going to be a much simpler and more fun approach to this mechanic.
    ```

    - u/covert_operator100:
      ```
      Thank you for clarifying my ideas. Inconsequential or inevitable is going to happen, I guess, but the players don't necessarily know these rules so it's probably fine.

      I believe it is okay to have memory wipes that are inevitable in the storytelling, but were a chancy thing from the characters' perspective. They just got unlucky. Although that does require more trust between players and GM.

      This isn't a 'D&D combat adventure' RPG. I have mechanics for emotional impact as well, though there isn't magic that messes with emotions directly.

      As for reasons why to wipe memory,
      Rich and powerful people could do memory wipes for completely mundane reasons, like embarrassment or looking bad in front of their crush. Or someone might have 'memory wipe after' written into a contract. Memory sometimes even disappears when you get hit hard, though that's rare (the people in this RPG aren't human.. anymore).

  I have this idea for a superhero setting, playing with the idea of the magical superhero (i.e. Doctor Strange). The inhabitants of the world being not just humans, but orcs and elves and goblins, etc. Technology level roughly the same as the modern day.

  Only issue is that I don't really have an idea for a proper story. Any ideas or thoughts, story or otherwise?
  ```

  - u/AlmostNeither:
    ```
    If you want a close-to-present tech level, multiple sapient races, magic as a source of power, and the conventions of superheroism all to be present and playing nicely with each other, it's worth spending some time/energy/thought on what purpose each of these serves in your story, and how the interactions among these things will or won't shape the story you want to tell.

    Sorry for the vague response, but I don't see how I could say anything more specific than that without a better sense of what your goals are.
    ```

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    I say write down everything you'd expect to see in something like this, then do the opposite:

    For instance:

    * Follow the ~~good~~ bad guy

    * Each country is made up of ~~a separate race~~ many colonies and nations that function as certain racial hot spots, kind of like the Ottoman empire, and most newer countries today. Different countries would clearly have different ratios of races, and different races would have different socioeconomic statuses depending on the country/region they're in. 

    * There is severe racism against orcs/goblins in humans/elf/dwarf populated areas. This would be false, and in fact although this was the case only a few decades ago, the world has generally been getting better about racial acceptance. 

    etc.
    ```

    - u/onemerrylilac:

      That sounds like a neat idea, thank you!
      ```

      - u/D0TheMath:
        ```
        Also, when writing inhuman characters, you should make them actually *not* human. A common fantasy trope is to make Orcs and Goblins evil/greedy without much thought into their thought processes. And to make elves and dwarfs different enough from each other, and humans, but not so different that differences can't be explained by cultural differences, and bodily makeup. 

        **EPISTEMIC STATUS: You would do well to ignore all of the below, as it comes primarily from naval-gazing. I have never actually written an inhuman character.**

        I'd recommend focusing on the generalized thought processes of each of the species, and get down a list of general guidelines for you to follow when constructing characters. It may be helpful to learn a bit about human phycology, but not necessary. 

        A sort of cheat could be to imagine each species as a kind of animal given conciousness. For instance, maybe Orcs would think in the same terms as rams. Constantly identifying threats, showing that they are not to be messed with, etc.
        ```

        - u/GeneralExtension:

          Another option is to have their cultures be different. (Perhaps if a human says "I'm rich and powerful!" and he isn't sitting on a pile of gold that fills a room, a dragon will say "Bullshit.".)

    You'd probably like the Shadowrun universe. It's cyberpunk + forgotten realms. There's tons of science fiction written within the setting. The narratives are mostly about criminal underbellies though.

  I've got a story idea I'm working on a bit at the moment. The general setting is as follows (subject to revision):

   - Five different fantasy races, each of which is associated with an element.
   - Elves = air, humans = water, orcs = earth, dwarves = metal, goblins = fire
   - Each race follows a different god
   - Most races stay in the lands their god gave them (elves are mostly gone, humans are traders/fishermen/pirates, dwarves live underground, orcs are farmers & herders on grasslands, goblins live in mountains and forests)
   - The dwarves are zealots and expansionist (similar to the way the US military behaves nowadays, especially in the Middle East)
   - The gods used to talk to their chosen race, but don't any more, ever since the goblins killed their god and stole the secret of gunpowder from his remains (this is the most original part of the setting, I think?)
   - Every race has 'raw' magic based on their element, and there's also magic rituals

  The story would follow a goblin as he tries to free his people, but not focus on military matters so much as magic, espionage and diplomacy.

  It's inspired by a mixture of Practical Guide to Evil, Codex Alera and the Inheritance cycle. I'm hoping it will turn out more rational than not.

  Questions:
   - Does the setting seem interesting, immediately off-putting, or somewhere in between?
   - Can someone recommend any good resources on Nato bases in Iraq/Afghanistan, especially from the perspective of the locals? It seems like a good place to start researching.
   - Can someone recommend good resources on conflicts where one side has primitive gunpowder weapons and the other doesn't? Either land- or sea-based would be useful.
   - (More for the future) where's a good place to post original webfiction if this ever gets that far? I know fictionpress.net and AO3 are potential options, but a lot of webfiction ends up on wordpress sites and that seems like a bit more hassle than I'd want.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I wouldn't say that it's off-putting, but it *does* seem a little bit ... paint-by-numbers? The first thing to actually get an eyebrow raise from me was goblins killing their god to steal the secrets of gunpowder, in part because it raises some potentially interesting questions, tensions, and conflicts. Of course, a lot of this is just a matter of execution, and I've long been of the opinion that the world doesn't matter that much unless that's going to be the primary showcase: plot, characterization, and prose are going to be the primary drivers of most stories.

  After reading Mother Of learning I am playing with the idea of making a game version of a time loop RPG. One thing I want to see better in games like skyrim is the world should change on your actions( not just guard barks) the downside of this is basically requires you lock off content to players based on their choices which is generally a nono effort/money wise. So to make replaying it part of the game would be a good idea.

  I am thinking of a world familiar so similar to skyrim or the witcher. Where you can kill monsters, rob people get gear etc.
  and advance in your player "skills"

  So there will be two ways you can bring info into repeats. One, in game spells or skills learned which will give you more options say like teleport.

  The second is info the user brings back in their own head. This is where I am asking for help, I have a bunch of ideas but I want to see what world changes in a game world that you expected to see based on your actions.

  Eamples: 
  Say you sell a bunch of high quality weapons to a bandit camp this should make the bandits attack people they would not normally not go for.
  If you kill a Monster the is attacking anyone a road this show allow trade through affecting prices etc.
  ```
