  Isn't that just like Fate, poking his nose into a nice groundhog day loop. No wonder nobody invites him to parties.

  This seems extremely familiar to me somehow, where have I seen. . . 

  [Aha!](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/2/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time)

  Reading through this story felt like a re-telling of the first three chapters I linked, only with the serial numbers filed off. It hits all the same notes:

  1. Protagonist with time-powers arrives back in his home with headache, check.

  2. Protagonist effortlessly disarms hidden bodyguard, amazing them and promising to explain it all later, check.


  3. Protagonist saves a beautiful woman from certain death using his fore-knowledge, then is surprised by sword-wielding plot twists, check.

  Is this the same author or something? These beginnings are practically identical. It's even got the same setting, with wand-wielding wizards and werewolves and such.
