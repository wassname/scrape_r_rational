  So I was feeling a bit nostalgic and was watching a few old youtube series. One of which is "Gym of the Romantic". A sarcastic take on all child hero tropes. The creator, I think, is brilliant and I find is work to be humorous and clever. I'm not so sure it's a "Rational Fiction" though. I guess one thing I noticed is the few bit of RF I've read have never been comedies. I wonder if those 2 facts are related. I don't now mostly I'm thinking I'm just trying to signal a creator I really like. Also Spoiler but there was a comic https://imgur.com/r/webcomics/mULJy

    (The linked page has a few interesting-monkey strips after some which feel as though they have big confusing gaps between them, then "the comic is still continuing on the creator's website", but the [www.dawnsomewhere.com](https://www.dawnsomewhere.com) website linked only shows 9 sections, of which none seem to have comic-relevant names or image-representations.  I'm curious to find whether the original comic makes any more sense before it gets to the monkey parts, but watching video (particularly with audio) is not convenient for me at this time.  Do you know whether there are more comic pages somewhere?)

      No the comics on imugr are complete as far as I remember. The gaps in the comic are all animated episodes.

  Normally I recommend this one instead: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVMEjDL2fbI&list=PLNC_sRuPtMonAOP46gqW9Q6E4ESFmum6d

  The creator has definitely referenced HPMOR in the past, and always seems to have some clever thought on the not-game-theory-not-economics thing.

  I can attest to the quality of this guy’s work. Fairly sarcastic humor, and he still produces content, though admittedly with a significantly lower production value. 

  However! I only watched his content due to the writing, and that has never dropped in quality. In particular I’ve been enjoying Radio Skyline (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcELqrEf9hgMlx7_Eok7zzz33JEZIlNjC), a fictional radio program for a Cities Skyline city.

  really nice to see this here - Greg's work has always felt just a step or two away from the style used by a lot of rational fiction, and I think Gym of the Romantic Journey is easily the best thing he's put out, being quite a unique little animated series. No-one here's mentioned that it got cancelled, but it was at the end of a little multi-episode arc so I've never minded too much. The setting's mythological origin as laid out in the comics felt very original and evocative to me, so they're definitely worth reading too

  in terms of Greg's more recent work, the ongoing webcomic [Kit's Orphanage](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/kits-orphanage/list?title_no=181549&page=1) has been doing some really interesting stuff in my opinion, expanding on the themes explored using the gnomes in Gym of the Romantic journey - namely the idea of dealing with entities that put a physical price on information in quite an alien way

  I watched the first two videos, it looks like there's not much more than lampshading, it's like reading a list that has the header and first paragraph of a bunch of random tvtropes articles.
