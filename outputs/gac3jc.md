  I've only started reading this recently so I don't know what the prior discussions have looked like, but I have a question: How big of a deal is... _narrative_ weight in this setting? Like, the whole story is usually "link gets the Master Sword and goes and seals away the evil" but I'm pretty darn confident that's not gonna pan out here unless the sword happens to actually work that way... I don't really know where I'm going with this thought.

  I'm getting the impression from the repeated failed attempts at research and distinct lack of magical tools and how none of the existing spells and things are freakishly powerful and exploitable. The first prelude chapter shows Zelda's plans at trying to use Green magic to increase crop yield and it's _barely working_. My gut says that trying to drive for a coincidental perfect cure-all exploit or spell is barking up the wrong tree, as tempting as it seems to us here given the sort-of /r/rational shared munchkin background.

  I propose that we should try to place more emphasis on a more conventional approach to solving our kingdom's problems. What assets do we have? What problems do we have? What are the priorities for the problems? Diplomatic envoys - can we send someone else to do the talking? We have an entire kingdom and we're just letting it _sit there_ while some unMarked NPCs run the thing. Surely we can come up with some nifty ideas in that department to better our relations with any allies in the region?

  ___
  Further brainstorming:

  Someone probably has a big list of problems and assets somewhere, (is [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAcqTsEhNs9l0y_ttb9Vhv5kfQwq4qzdQCVmtqMaoSk/edit) up to date?) but if not, I'll try to throw some out there - unless there's a list with this stuff already out there, please let me know if I'm missing stuff.

  Problems:

  * Ja'Bu
  * Ganondorf
  * Demise
  * Vesyrn?
  * Diplomatic relations with Shesan
  * Hyrule is under... attack?

  Assets:

  * Military - normal footsoldiers. What have they been doing? Are there any inefficiencies (too many deployed somewhere)? Would we get value siphoning off a small portion of the military to enact a campaign somewhere we aren't kidding? I don't know what this would look like, and I don't know if it's been discussed before.
  * Sheikah - we apparently desperately need intelligence. Do we have spies? Scouts? We didn't know this Ganondorf thing was happening until just a little while ago, and don't have any open lines of communications to the Gorons(?) or to anyone in the Lost Woods, Dremen Valley... etc. What's happening over there? Can we send Sheikah to check? Or should we send diplomats?
  * Other personnel, like diplomats?
  ___
  The world map is massive, and we only have vision into about a 6th of it. How can we get more info? That's a lot of space for potential allies and threats to just be sitting around with us unaware of them.

    For your first question, the answer is 0%. Or at least as close to 0% as possible for Vecht.

    Quoting from the about page with bolds added for emphasis. 

    >Legacy of the Goddess is a rational-deconstruction take on the Legend of Zelda setting, as an AU cross with the cosmere setting, and explored in the format of a Quest. Among other things, this work aims to be:  

    >  
    >Rational:  
    >  
    >**Characters behave realistically and according to their motivations, not just because the plot, players, or QMs demand it.** NPCs have agency, care about the world they inhabit, and will take action towards fulfilling their interests even where it conflicts with player intent. Magic behaves lawfully and has strict rules on what it can and cannot do.  

    >  
    >**It is important to note that no character is immune to consequence and anyone can die. Destiny and prophecy are nowhere to be found here.**

    We've tried to contact the Gorons, but Hyrule apparently has no clue on how to talk to them. They also seem to have no knowledge of any other civilizations out there.

    The problem I have with focusing on managing Hyrule more is that "*NPCs have agency, care about the world they inhabit, and will take action towards fulfilling their interests even where it conflicts with player intent."* NPCs aren't incompetent. Wymar is an experienced general and I'm pretty skeptical that us armchair generals can do a better job than him. The same with Taetus and famine management, etc. 

    Zelda is very young and inexperienced, so unless she has something game-changing like the Fi lie detector she's better off delegating and focusing on important stuff that only she can do. This is all assuming the NPCs are actually working in the same direction as us of course.

    On the other hand, Link does have more experience in the being a military officer thing, so he might be able to improve the war effort. But his skills there aren't unique, meanwhile his proto-lightsworn status is.

    We should be able to get some more maps from Sheshan.

  (Maybe not actually serious here but)

  SACRIFICE THE TRIFORCE SO DEMISE CAN'T GET IT. 

  I can see no way sacrificing the source of the world's magic could go wrong.
  ```

  - u/Mathematicae:
    ```
    My guess is that Ganondorf is trying to do exactly that.
    ```

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    Ok no but maybe... Listen to me... What about sacrificing a single piece of the triforce of Power??  


    ((Of couse it could backfire in many ways (for instance, the fragment could disintegrate and just re-coalesce where Ganondorf is, to go to him).))

  **\[Plan: Split the Party\]**

  Similar to Plan Spire in the Sands, but we're splitting the party. I have a number of instructions for Zelda's ~~lackeys~~ valued councilors to do back home. I'm welcome to any suggestions on how to improve.

  **Action by either/both Champion:**

  * Combine maps with Shesan and put points of interest (e.g. potential fragment locations, Link's vision locations, Gannondorf/his armies' locations, etc.) on the map. Attempt to plan an efficient route to visit the vision locations safely and rapidly. The plan is for Link + some companions to go to the **Obsidian Spire** first on the list unless another location is closer.
  * Spend a day or however long it takes for Grenja and Malg to reach the Sunseeker camp discussing things with Shesan, resting, and restocking supplies. Use the time to discuss high priority items related to the spire itself or the journey there.
  * Propose Marking Shesan as soon as we have sufficient Divine Power as a symbol of an alliance between your factions. Use this as a chance to also discuss what Shesan knows about Marks, Divine Power, and Old Magic.
  * Izu is in charge of security for the remainder of the trip, Link needs to do Lightsworn stuff. While traveling with the reduced guard, have Zelda apply Luck to herself, using Fi to recharge MP if needed.

  **Link Actions:**

  * Link's visions probably qualify as **The Champion's Trials** (Chapter III). Discuss knowledge of these trials that may be relevant with Zelda and Seshan, such as common puzzles and threats. Especially note if the Champion needs to do everything solo. Pick up needed supplies for a trial while in town.
  * Link + 3 Sheikah (Koja, Grenja, and Malg) + a possible Gerudo guide(s) head to the Obsidian Spire. 3 Sheikah is to cover the 3 magic types and include healing, CQC, and recon/infiltration. If Link prefers swapping in different Sheikah, except Laylith, then he can make that decision based on his best judgement.

  **Zelda Actions:**

  * Based on Zelda's dream, there might be a fragment in the Lost Woods. It's not like Shesan as many other leads. See if Shesan knows anything about significant locations in that area, and offer to coordinate sending a team to investigate.
  * Check if Wymar has sent instructions on where he wants Naibi's soldiers deployed and pass it along to Naibi. Talk with Link, the Sheikah, Izu, and especially Naibi about how to keep Naibi's soldiers and Hylian soldiers from getting into fights. Promise Naibi that she'll do her utmost to make sure Naibi and her soldiers are treated with the full respect they deserve and to fairly address any grievance.
  * Instruct Lensa and any other relevant council members (message via scry link) to gather information about how Hyrule contacted the Gorons in the past. If the location of a Goron settlement is known, then the plan is to send a messenger asking for assistance and warning about Gannondorf likely attacking them. If just a vague area is known, then plan is to send a Sheikah team to locate Goron settlements and then send a messenger.
  * Instruct the relevant council members (possibly Nyllara as this is a legal/administrative matter and again via scry link) to prepare a list of abandoned baronies. Preferably one at the edges of the Floodplains as Zelda was already intending. Make sure to inform Naibi that you're working on locating a suitable plot of land.
  * Send for Grenja & Malg (again via scry link) to come to the Sunseekers camp while Link and Koja prepare for the expedition.
  * Zelda and the rest of the party not going with Link will return to Castletown by way of Last Bastion. Leave around when Link's expedition sets out.
  * While stopping at Last Bastion, meet with High Captain Roesar. He ought to already know that the Sunseekers have promised soldiers to assist, so politely ask him to do his best to prevent altercations between Hylians and Sunseekers. If there are problems, then Zelda wants to be informed about it. We do not want her diplomacy wrecked because interpersonal conflict wasn't brought to her attention.
  * Continue DODGE!!! training.

  **Sheikah Allocation:**

  * Get a message to Sheikah that is trailing Vesryn to see if they can rendezvous with Vesryn and make a truce. Order the Sheikah to cooperate with Vesryn in the search for the fragments, but to keep an eye on him. Make sure Shesan simultaneously contacts Vesryn to let him know we are combining our efforts. If Shesan has no way of contacting Vesryn, simply call our Sheikah off the search for Vesryn instead and reallocate them - we don't want a bloody mess if they try to make contact and it turns into a fight.
  * Ask Sheshan to contact Golvara to meet with Zelda back in Hyrule. If he's stuck behind enemy lines, offer to send a Sheikah team to extract him. When we talk with him, we will want to inquire about the other locations Link saw, among other things of course.

  **Discussion with Shesan - High Priority:**

  * Ask if Morudo Geira could have formed a new avatar by now, and if so, what Shesan knows about how Gandondorf defeated it (and if there are any other strengths and weaknesses she knows about it). Also ask her if there are any Sunseekers that would be willing to guide us to the Obsidian Spire (Since most Gerudo hate talking about it asking around for a guide probably wouldn't go well). We should get as much info as possible.
  * Share what we already know about the capabilities of groups of Wisdom fragments, although she probably already knows. See if she knows anything about the benefits of groups of Power and Courage fragments. Especially Power since Gannondorf has gathered most of them and Link or Zelda might end up in personal combat with him.
  * Explain what we know about Marks and that that we wisht to mark additional people to generate Divine Power rapidly. See if she is willing to assist us with this process, by letting us mark her or her agents, for example, and if she has any ideas on how to do this more efficiently.
  * Discuss our general understanding of Fi's abilities and Old Magic. See if she knows anything that could be useful for creating the foundation of new spells. Both the Fae and Morudo Geira seem to use something awfully similar to Sacrifice, but why use human sacrifice instead of something more ethical and sustainable? Is it important to use it in a specific location? Raise the possibility that Gannondorf is gathering the fragments to Sacrifice them to 'Demise'.
  * Have Link ask Shesan if she knows anything about the current location and powers of the Sword of Evil's Bane. It sounds like the type of thing we might want to have against an entity as powerful as Demise, and Link would probably love having a magic sword. If we can find out where it may be located, put it on the map as a potential place to visit. If we believe there are prerequisites to claiming it, we can defer visiting it until after those prerequisites (e.g. being a full Lightsworn) are met.

  **Discussion with Shesan - Medium Priority:**

  * What can Shesan tell us about her own magic? She gave us a vision - how did that work? She knows a lot about us - is that through divination magic? What are the limits of it?
  * Does her own form of magic offer any unique abilities that might help us reach fragments before Ganondorf, like flight or teleportation?
  * Shesan mentioned that she did not think we could bond to the fragments of power. Why, is it because individuals can only attune with a single fragment type? What are the criteria for bonding with fragments? Magic affinity is likely connected, but are more soft things like personality also relevant?
  * Ask what she knows about constructs (ie Fi) and what capabilities and nature constructs usually have. If constructs usually have some trait that Fi supposedly doesn't have, we might be able to expand her capabilities.
  * Are there any more of her agents around, like Seff for instance? He did try to steal a fragment after all. We wouldn't want to get in each other's way.

  **Discussion with Shesan - Low Priority:**

  * Get a list of Sheikah agents that were working with Vesryn from Shesan. Make sure Fi is present when we are given the list. Compare to our list from the Sheikah interrogations. See if we made any mistakes in our trusted agents list.
  * Ask what she knows about Lightsworn (She most know something since she's so sure that Gannondorf and Link weren't one). What can she tell us about the egg? The process of becoming a Lightsworn? The capabilities we should expect a Lightsworn to have?
  * Ask her what she knows about Ja'bu. Is it a void entity similar to Morudo Geira? Did the Zora engage in ritual sacrifice like with Morudo Geira?

  **Other:**

  * Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.
  * The reverse of the first bullet point is that Link/Zelda can siphon his/her mana to sheikah and then have Fi refill his/her reserve. I'd like to have both test if it is possible to say recharge Koja after doing healing or Malg/Laylith/Ryn after doing a bunch of Scrying & Telepathy (examples of what we could use them for). Are there physical or mental fatigue issues (beyond Fi running out of MP to refill)?
  * Test if Fi can use Rejuvenate on non-marked individuals. Start with animals like horses after a days riding. Then move on to Sheikah, preferably Laylith since she's already partially in the know on Fi's existence. If it does work, have Fi analyze if there's a reduction in VP efficiency.

  **Personal Research**

  * Perform personal research from the prior chapter, as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g6dqi0/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/folj79u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

    ```
    I support this plan.  
    Per Vecht:
    > Of your six Sheikah:

    > Cove: Strong red / Baseline green. Specializes in augmented CQC.  
    > Grenja: Very strong red. Specializes in augmented CQC.  
    > Laylith: Very strong blue. Specializes in recon, infiltration, and ranged combat (magic).  
    > Koja: Very strong green. Specializes in healing and ranged combat (magic).  
    > Malg: Moderate blue / Moderate red. Specializes in recon and infiltration.  
    > Ryn: Strong blue / Moderate green. Specializes in recon and healing.  

    For Link's travel, I feel that a squad of three Sheikah and Link is appropriate. Recommend:

    Red - Grenja, melee combat  
    Blue - Laylith, Recon, ranged combat  
    Green - Koja, Healing, ranged combat  
    And then, of course, Link. A badass.

      I'm leaving Laylith behind with Zelda. She's more elderly and seems to do a good job helping Zelda. (Discussing dreams and cutting through Niabi's snowing us).

      Malg or Ryn will cover the Blue/recon need.
      ```

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    I support this plan!

    Something very minor: I'd add theories to the questions where we have them. E.g. when asking about Ja'bu specifically ask if it's a fae-like entity.  
    (I'm sorry I'm not contributing more)
    ```

    - u/Mathematicae:
      ```
      Good suggestion, we've been told that offering theories will get us better answers. I've tried adding some of that to the question sections.
      ```

- u/-Vecht-:
  ```
  ~~**Voting time!**~~ E: Voting is closed.

  …Well, that was certainly something.

  You can assume Link & Fi updated Zelda regarding the Triforce fragments.

  **What do you do next?**

  * So about that Ja'bu situation…
  * Maybe it's best if we prioritize stopping Ganondorf from completing the Triforce of Power?
  * But what about the Spire? Don't we want to make Link a full Lightsworn? How else can he hope to face Demise?
  * Or we could try and find more Wisdom fragments. There's Vesyrn, and also Zelda's dreams…
  * Maybe Shesan has more to say? ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
  * *<varied, repeated, panicked screaming>*

  Great update. Congratulations on crossing 100k words!

  I'll probably throw together a plan at some point, but I'd like to get some discussion going with other readers first.

  Some current bullet points I'm thinking about:

  Talk with Shesan:

  * Have Link fill Zelda in on what we've learned.
  * Wait until Zelda is feeling better, then have another group discussion with Shesan.
  * What can Shesan tell us about her own magic? She gave us a vision - how did that work? She knows a lot about us - is that through divination magic? What are the limits of it? 
  * Does her own form of magic offer any unique abilities that might help us reach fragments before Ganondorf, like flight or teleportation?
  * Shesan mentioned that she did not think we could bond to the shards of power. Why? What are the criteria for bonding with them? Who does she think would be an eligible candidate?
  * What does she think Ganondorf's plan is? How does he play into this?
  * Discuss famous items that may be disguised fragments, e.g. The Lover's Rings or The Golden Gauntlets. Does Shesan have any information on them?
  * Ask if she knows anything about the current location and powers of the Sword of Evil's Bane. It sounds like the type of thing we might want to have against an entity as powerful as Demise.
  * Ask what she knows about Fi's capabilities and nature that we may not already be aware of.
  * Ask what she knows about how Hylea's marks work, especially in regards to generating Divine Power. Our capabilities are significantly improved if we can generate Divine Power more rapidly.
  * Ask if Morudo Geira's could have formed a new avatar by now, and if so, what she knows about how Gandondorf defeated it (and if there are any other strengths and weaknesses she knows about it). We should get as much info as possible if we want to hit that location.
  * Ask what she knows about Lightsworn. What can she tell us about the egg? The process of becoming a Lightsworn? The capabilities we should expect a Lightsworn to have?
  * Ask what she knows about Old Magic, both in terms of using it and things that could be useful foundations for spell construction.
  * Ask her what she knows about Ja'bu.

  Sheikah: 

  * If possible, get a message to sheikah to see if they can rendezvous with Vesryn and make a truce. Order the sheikah to cooperate with Vesryn in the search for the fragments, but to keep an eye on him. Make sure Shesan simultaneously contacts Vesryn to let him know we are combining our efforts. If Shesan has no way of contacting Vesryn, simply call our sheikah off the search for Vesryn instead and reallocate them - we don't want a bloody mess if they try to make contact and it turns into a fight.
  * Discuss with Shesan: Possibly arrange for a sheikah escort for Golvara to meet with us and consolidate our knowledge fragments.
  * Get a list of sheikah agents that were working with Vesryn from Shesan. Make sure Fi is present when we are given the list. Compare to our list from Fi defections. See if we made any mistakes in our trusted agents list.

  Route:

  * Combine maps with Shesan and put points of interest (e.g. potential fragment locations and Link's vision locations) on the map. Attempt to plan an efficient route to visit these various locations safely and rapidly. For example, if the Obsidian Spire is the current closest spot, figure out what the next closest point of interest is and plan on going there next.
  * We need to discuss if we want to split our forces. At the moment, I still lean toward keeping Link and Zelda in one place, but we may want to Mark another high-end combatant of some kind that can race Ganondorf for Fragments of Power.

  Marks:

  * We should consider if we want to mark Shesan next (assuming she's even interested).

  Other:

  * Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power.
  ```

  - u/Mathematicae:
    ```
    We should try to get a list of names from Seshan of the Sheikah that were working for Vesyrn and then compare it with our interrogation results. Make sure Fi is present and have her attest to the list being accurate.

    Personally, I'm leaning towards sending Link+an appropriate party to investigate the Obsidian Spire.
    ```

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    I agree on the questions to shesan. However, given the QM's repeated admonitions that we need to *do* *stuff* or we're forked, maybe we can meld some of that into an actionable plan:  
    What I'd say is, keep the questions but outline some plans of action and discuss them with Shesan. Presumably that discussion will also give some relevant information. I also proppose this because I assume orienting plans to action makes the chapters more fun to write, but I don't know if that's true.
    ```

    - u/-Vecht-:
      ```
      >  I also proppose this because I assume orienting plans to action makes the chapters more fun to write, but I don't know if that's true.

      All the yes.

      As players, sure, yes, you need information. I get that. However, even setting aside in-universe time constraints, you have to remember this is a story first. That is, its primary function is to engage readers.

      Infodumps and dry conversations aren't usually fun to read or write. I and the other QMs are of course going to do our damnedest to make every chapter as engaging as possible and keep the plot moving. However, that becomes increasingly difficult when we are constrained by player agency saying "have more meetings and talk about things at great length without actually doing anything that might progress the plot." That just translates to more effort on our end to keep things engaging, which means (among other things) lower update frequency.

      Another point: there is more than enough information given to answer some of these questions yourselves. There are *so many details* that no one seems to pick up on (*hint hint wink wink nudge nudge*). If you (players) put in the work to come up with reasonable hypotheses to present to NPCs during info-gathering attempts (as opposed to just scattershotting questions and hoping to be fed the answers), not only will you get more out of the conversations, but we (QMs) will reward you for it with substantially higher VP bonuses.

      On the same note, if you come up with intelligent ideas on your own as to how to solve or make progress on the various problems facing you -- including going out on a limb and putting forth preferred options -- you will get *far* more out of planning conversations with NPCs than just blindly asking them how they think you should proceed. (Also you will get more VP.)

      Also also, and most importantly, I will be more motivated to write and get updates out sooner.

      This isn't to say actions will ever be free of consequence. That is emphatically not the case. I am however explicitly stating that inaction will result in poorer outcomes than taking any reasonable course of action. To put it another way: voting in (some sane variant of) any of the default options at this juncture will result in better outcomes (both IC and OOC) than a plan that does nothing but blindly ask questions of NPCs or which takes a "wait and see" approach.

      In summary: you are absolutely correct on this point, and without straying outside the confines of simulationism, the QMs will find ways to reward proactivity.

      Plz do stuff.

      +10 points to you for bringing this up.
      ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      Some of my favorite chapters in things I'm reading (Delve, Forge of Destiny, etc.) are based around when characters just sit around and chat about the world and systems. That said, the QMs apparently agree with you in this particular case, and thus I will tune any actual plan toward action and put the questions in a prioritized section where the QMs can pick and choose which to answer.
      ```

      - u/eltegid:
        ```
        Hey, I never got around to answering this: I absolutely love chapters that are pure conversation and/or pure exposition. I pointed that out trying to take into account the point of view of the QMs, and certainly not because there was anything wrong with your plan by itself!
        ```

        - u/Salaris:
          ```
          Makes sense! I can certainly understand that perspective and will try to keep it in mind for future plans with these QMs.
          ```

    - u/eltegid:
      ```
      Also, at this point I think I would separate Link and Zelda: if lightsworn are as powerful as they seem, Link should go to the spire and see what's up. Regarding Zelda, not only can her time be better spent, it seems that going with Link (and a team, I guess) to Morudo Geira's lair is actually less safe than being in many other places.  


      (I'll be more proactive in propposing stuff to do as soon as I have time!)
      ```

  - u/eltegid:
    ```
    We should also ask about Ja'bu. Presumably Shesan knows something more, since Golvara worked for her.

    EDIT: I don't know if there are theories around, but I'd bet Morudo Geira and Ja'bu are both fae or fae-like entities. I also think there's another entity in one of the forests.
    ```

    - u/Mathematicae:
      ```
      They very likely are. The whole Gerudo ritually killing their males thing to appease Morudo *screams* Sacrifice.
      ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      Added a bullet point for this.
      ```

  - u/Cariyaga:
    ```
    I strongly prefer splitting Zelda and Link up at this point, if visiting the spire takes more than a few days. Send him and a few Sheikah to check it out, and have Zelda stay with Shesan, offer her a mark if she desires one. 

    I'd also like to ask Shesan if she knows anything of Old Magic. Zelda's dreams indicate that it's important that she learns of it. That aside, asking after anything from which Fi could create her own spells would be good too.
    ```

    - u/Mathematicae:
      ```
      I'd prefer Zelda goes back to Castletown. Organize an expedition to see what calamity has wrecked the Gorons and ~~kicking the homeless Zora off our lawn~~ helping the Zora recover their own kingdom. I think Zelda needs to be in person to do that because the kingdom is in really bad shape and the NPCs are going to be really reluctant to 'waste' valuable resources on not putting out their own fires.
      ```

    - u/Salaris:
      ```
      > I strongly prefer splitting Zelda and Link up at this point, if visiting the spire takes more than a few days. Send him and a few Sheikah to check it out, and have Zelda stay with Shesan, offer her a mark if she desires one. 

      I feel like we miss out on the potential VP income of sending Zelda along to do "heroic" things if we're just going to keep her sitting in one spot. 

      Maybe we could convince Shesan to come with us and discuss things while we travel, then just park Shesan and Zelda outside while Link goes in with Sheikah?

      I suppose the main downside of this would be if Link and the sheikah could travel significantly faster without Zelda, but I don't get the impression that is the case, since they're all limited by horse speed and endurance.

      > I'd also like to ask Shesan if she knows anything of Old Magic. Zelda's dreams indicate that it's important that she learns of it. That aside, asking after anything from which Fi could create her own spells would be good too.

      Good call. Will add that.

  Spoilers for Mistborn books 1-3

  >!I can't help but see parallels between preservation and Hylia. Both "Died" but much of their power was left in the world, preservation's as the mist and Hylia's as the Triforce. Gathering the Triforce could be a way to channel the remaining power, similar to the well of ascension.!<

  As for the Triforce- I'm getting a monopoly vibe here, as in the first person to get a full set is likely to win. Luckily we one of each already, so that's something. 

  I wonder who we have who could bind with the power fragment? We should ask Fi what qualities make a person compatible, and if anybody we've met has those qualities as far as she can tell. Though if it switches to a better candidate when it meets one, I think we'll have a hard time finding somebody more compatible with power fragments than Ganondorf is.

  Well, if Ganondorf already has 5/9ths of a triforce, I think it is imperative that we get at least one power fragment to prevent him from having a whole set. I don't know what just the Power triforce can do without Courage and Wisdom, but I'd also rather not find out. 

  Given the theming of forests=courage, lakes=wisdom, and mountains=power*, it's probably a power fragment the Gorons have. Acquiring and/or securing it should be our highest medium-term priority.

    Gorons 100% have a power fragment (unless Ganondorf just nabbed it.)

    Lynx also confirmed that Vesyrn still has the power fragment he stole from Zelda's dad.

  [**Plan: Spire of the Sands**]

  This plan takes some of the discussion items I'd compiled before and shifts them into an action-focused format. The discussion items below the action section are optional for QMs to address in the story at their discretion. My attempt at prioritizing them is based on my own ideas of what may be relevant to our immediate plans, but QMs may choose to ignore this prioritization if it is convenient or more fun for them.

  If some of the actions below are boring to write, please feel free to summarize/hand-waive that they occurred.

  **Action:**

  * Combine maps with Shesan and put points of interest (e.g. potential fragment locations and Link's vision locations) on the map. Attempt to plan an efficient route to visit these various locations safely and rapidly. The plan is to go to the **Obsidian Spire** first on the list, and the route should take that into account.
  * Mark down what we believe Ganondorf's current location is on the map. Discuss his goals and his own likely route, as well as methods we could take to potentially interfere with his progress prior to a direct confrontation.
  * Discuss that Link's visions probably qualify as **The Champion's Trials** mentioned in Chapter III. Discuss knowledge of these trials that may be relevant, such as whether specific supplies are commonly needed for the puzzles and threats. Pick up needed supplies for a trial while in town.
  * Spend a day discussing things with Shesan, resting, and restocking supplies. During/after that discussion, propose that Shesan accompany your group. Use time to discuss high priority items related to the spire itself and any threats that may be encountered along the journey.
  * If Shesan is willing to accompany the group, ask more questions on the journey.
  * Propose Marking Shesan as soon as we have sufficient Divine Power as a symbol of an alliance between your factions. Use this as a chance to also discuss what Shesan knows about Marks, Divine Power, and Old Magic.
  * Head to the Obsidian Spire. Bring everyone (Link, Zelda, sheikah, Shesan if willing). Make camp outside. Current plan is for Link to enter with a group of sheikah. If legends indicate that a Lightsworn candidate must enter alone, take that into account. If the group feels that entering in full force is better, that is also acceptable. Let Link's tactical knowledge and info learned from Shesan about Morudo Geira inform this choice.

  **Sheikah Allocation:**

  * Get a message to sheikah that is trailing Vesryn to see if they can rendezvous with Vesryn and make a truce. Order the sheikah to cooperate with Vesryn in the search for the fragments, but to keep an eye on him. Make sure Shesan simultaneously contacts Vesryn to let him know we are combining our efforts. If Shesan has no way of contacting Vesryn, simply call our sheikah off the search for Vesryn instead and reallocate them - we don't want a bloody mess if they try to make contact and it turns into a fight.
  * Arrange for a sheikah escort for Golvara to meet with us and consolidate our knowledge fragments.

  **Discussion with Shesan - High Priority:**

  * Ask if Morudo Geira's could have formed a new avatar by now, and if so, what Shesan knows about how Gandondorf defeated it (and if there are any other strengths and weaknesses she knows about it). We should get as much info as possible if we want to hit that location.
  * Share what we already know about the capabilities of groups of Wisdom shards. See if she knows anything about the benefits of groups of Power and Courage shards.
  * Explain what we know about Marks and that we feel that marking additional entities to generate Divine Power rapidly is a part of our plan. See if she is willing to assist us with this process and if she has any ideas on how to do this more efficiently.
  * Discuss our general understanding of Fi's abilities and Old Magic. See if she knows anything that could be useful for creating the foundation of new spells.
  * Have Link ask Shesan if she knows anything about the current location and powers of the Sword of Evil's Bane. It sounds like the type of thing we might want to have against an entity as powerful as Demise, and Link would probably love having a magic sword. If we can find out where it may be located, put it on the map as a potential place to visit. If we believe there are prerequisites to claiming it, we can defer visiting it until after those prerequisites (e.g. being a full Lightsworn) are met.

  **Discussion with Shesan - Medium Priority:**

  * What can Shesan tell us about her own magic? She gave us a vision - how did that work? She knows a lot about us - is that through divination magic? What are the limits of it? 
  * Does her own form of magic offer any unique abilities that might help us reach fragments before Ganondorf, like flight or teleportation?
  * Shesan mentioned that she did not think we could bond to the shards of power. Why? What are the criteria for bonding with them? Who does she think would be an eligible candidate?
  * Ask what she knows about Fi's capabilities and nature that we may not already be aware of.

  **Discussion with Shesan - Low Priority:**

  * Discuss famous items that may be disguised fragments, e.g. The Lover's Rings or The Golden Gauntlets. Does Shesan have any information on them?
  * Get a list of sheikah agents that were working with Vesryn from Shesan. Make sure Fi is present when we are given the list. Compare to our list from Fi defections. See if we made any mistakes in our trusted agents list.
  * Ask what she knows about Lightsworn. What can she tell us about the egg? The process of becoming a Lightsworn? The capabilities we should expect a Lightsworn to have?
  * Ask her what she knows about Ja'bu.

  **Other:**

  * Depending on how large of a time period the next chapter covers, I'd like to begin testing if Zelda can safely transfer mana to Fi, and if so, if we could start a chain of transferring "excess" mana from others (e.g. sheikah) through Zelda and Link to Fi with the goal of gathering additional Void Power each day through this "excess" power. If Shesan is accompanying us, she if she can contribute to this process (either in terms of knowledge or adding more people we can use for VP farming).

  **Personal Research**

  * Perform personal research from the prior chapter, as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/g6dqi0/rtdc_legacy_of_the_goddess_a_rational_zelda_quest/folj79u?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

  So... pretty sure we've missed a thing. A while ago, Fi mentioned that she couldn't instantiate items because they don't exist within the void. Well, why not try creating items previously sacrificed? Or, alternately, asking if she could figure out a way to store things in an extradimensional space.

  Okay. We know that Triforce fragments have bullshit levels of power to return to their owners. It will come back even if you want it gone.

  I propose the following experiment. We tie the fragment to a rock, and load it in a catapult. We point that at the sea. We give a soldier instructions to fire the catapult unless we guess a number between one and six, which he has written down. We roll a die, and tell the soldier that number.

  Repeat a few times. If we keep guessing correctly, up the number of dice. If we start getting like 10d6 accurate every time, assume we have a fairly strong oracle.

  If we get 100d6, assume invincibility.

  If it does work like that, we are capable of solving np problems in O(1). 

  Math and codebreaking can be guided by the catapult oracle. So can chemistry.

  OOH! this might work too.

  Hand the fragment to someone. Request that they not hand it back unless they see [something] in the next hour. Or the next day. Or the next week.

  Hand the fragment to someone. Request that they not hand it back unless they win a competition against a matched opponent, then an over matched opponent.

  Have someone else place a marker in a forest, and fire the fragment from a catapult. Commit to only retrieving fragment if the catapult landed near the marker.

  I've got a bunch of ideas. Generate rain by throwing it into a deep, dry, abandoned well, tied to something buoyant. 

  The point is, the fragments most impressive power is the nigh unbeatable probability pump tied to them. We need to figure out how that pump works, what sort of timescales it operates under, what changes it prefers making.

  Care should be taken. At some point, it might just decide to kill the bonded individual, because that is easier then pulling the fragment out of the mineshaft you just collapsed.

    Depending on the mechanism we'll get some kind of a "do not mess with time" bleed-off thing that prevents some of these from working - for example:

    > Hand the fragment to someone. Request that they not hand it back unless they see [something] in the next hour. Or the next day. Or the next week.

    This can be circumvented by someone stealing the fragment and bringing it back to us.

    > We tie the fragment to a rock, and load it in a catapult. We point that at the sea. We give a soldier instructions to fire the catapult unless we guess a number between one and six, which he has written down. We roll a die, and tell the soldier that number.

    The unstated assumption here is that the fragment is unrecoverable in this context - but Zoras exist, so it would be relatively easy for there to just _coincidentally_ be a Zora hanging around who grabs the fragment and returns it to us.

    ___
    Overall I guess I'd say that I think your general assertion is correct:
    > We need to figure out how that pump works, what sort of timescales it operates under, what changes it prefers making.

    but there's so many little ways we can be screwed over and the pump defeated without actually getting useful information out of it... this feels like a situation where we're fighting an uphill battle cheating the system. Using the things as oracles feels like... it doesn't fit _thematically_ with the kind of story Vecht is telling. 

    Maybe I'm wrong - maybe we spend a few hours one day trying it out, seeing what happens - but I gamble it'll get shut down fast and we'll need to solve things in a more conventional manner.

    EDIT: I just found [this discussion](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.55903/post-13047074) and there were some details that swung me a little more toward this seeming like a decent idea.
    ```

    - u/Mathematicae:

      Thanks for bringing up most of my concerns about the details of the potential experiments. I'd just add that the fragments have been able to influence things *before* an event that tries to take it away from a bonded individual (Zelda's locket broke before Vesyrn tried to steal her wisdom fragments so he only stole the bracers and the chain the locket should have been attached to.) So the catapult could suffer a malfunction because something broke the night before.

      A couple other points that make me very reluctant to do this.

      If we screw it up, we've lost a fragment. That is *really, really* bad.

      This is a Cosmere crossover, and a fragment is probably a fragment of a Shard. We've seen Shard bearers predict the future, but they've also made some pretty serious errors when predicting the future. The examples are obviously spoilers so I won't list them out. Basically, even though the bearers had a much more potent divination tool, it still didn't work perfectly. Therefore, I'd expect a single fragment be much less able to predict the future. Indeed the Wisdom shards give vague prophetic dreams which is much weaker than what a full Shard could do.

      Another thing I'm worried about, is that the fragments have a limited amount of power they're already doing some pretty useful things and I'd hate to make those effects weaker.

      &#x200B;

      Edit: On a reread of the latest chapter, Link thinks it's odd he just stands there after the Lynx throws his fragment out the window. I think the fragment was pushing Link to be in the right place at the right time to retrieve the fragment.
