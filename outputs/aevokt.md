  Used effectively, the Death Note isn't so much an assassination tool as it is a mind control tool that happens to have the unfortunate side effect of killing the targets. 

  If Light's wants to wipe out crime, then targeting probable criminals for whom there isn't enough evidence to convict is ridiculous. Instead he should have the heads of terrorist organizations, drug cartels, and the like, all experience bouts of guilt, turn themselves in, share detailed records of the names, faces, and locations of their subordinates, and then commit suicide in jail.

  The effectiveness of such a campaign would be boosted by cooperating with government agencies, but it might be difficult to do so without those agencies obtaining the Death Note, which would be [potentially disastrous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO).

  ------------------------------------------------------

  A less gruesome use of the Death Note is as a form of euthanasia. And this may have the beneficial side effect of extending other people's lives.  One of the rules of the Death Note is as follows: 

  > A human death caused by the Death Note will indirectly lengthen some other human's original life even without a specific intention to lengthen a particular person's original life span in the human world.

  Combined with the fact that "A god of death can extend their own life by putting a name on their own note, but humans cannot.", this suggests that the stolen lifespan is randomly distributed to another human. So Euthanasia can redistribute lifespan from those who don't want it to someone who, statistically speaking, likely does.

  This also calls to mind some sort of dystopian nightmare where the lifespan of humans is harvested from toddlers to make the rest of humanity immortal. Like how fetal souls are farmed for fuel in Worth the Candle, but significantly more horrific because the Death Note can't kill someone until 780 days after birth.

  Hrm, and the sacrificed children would have to actually have the potential to live long lives absent the Death Note intervention, or else the Note can't harvest their counterfactual lifespan. So there would have to be facilities to raise them, kept mostly empty except for randomly spared 'calibration children'. It would be interesting to read a story from such a child's perspective.

    *Is* this a dystopian nightmare?  I mean, arguably small children are less intelligent than livestock we routinely murder for food.  Arguably, preserving sentient self aware adults who have been around for centuries is a higher cause.  You know, if you had to.  And you would ideally gene edit the small children so they are all born with microcephaly and use artificial wombs if you can so there's no mother or father to be emotionally attached.
    ```

    - u/wren42:
      ```
      This creates a really interesting moral quandry where you need the targets to count as a person to harvest "lifetime" from, but don't want them to be a person for ethical reasons.

      &#x200B;

      Is there an optimal tipping point of personhood where you get maximum life value for minimal evil?

      &#x200B;

      the deathnote requires a face and a name, so I suppose you need the fetus to develop at least so far as to be recognizable as an individual, and give it an identifier.
      ```

    - u/turtleswamp:
      ```
      The logistics of collecting the children for slaughter would be pretty dystopian.

      Parents tend to get pretty attached to their children, and you're unlikely to get enough donations for the system to work. In particular you need to worry about the effect of slowing death on population growth and reign in births accordingly so you're talking about confiscating children by force. 

      &#x200B;

      And preserving adults at the expense of children is likely to lead to social and genetic stagnation. It would probably be strictly worse for the human species than the status quo in the long run.
      ```

        There are lots of potential problems  but I seriously doubt  genetic stagnation is one.We really don't want to let evolution run its course long term.
        ```

  - u/MagicWeasel:
    ```
    The part about lengthening the lifespan is more in the case of, if Light kills a murderer who would later go on to murder Misa on the 1 January 2010, then Misa lives past the 1 January 2010 and instead will die on, say, the 1 January 2018. This has extended her lifespan even though Light didn't intend this: the 8 extra years doesn't "come from" the murderer, it just appears out of nowhere, AFAIK. I don't believe the "conservation of lifespan" that Death Gods operate under applies to humans at all, canonically.
    ```

    - u/bacontime:
      ```
      Yeah. It's sort of ambiguous what that rule means.  I think your interpretation of the rule is more likely to be what the author intended. But both interpretations fit well with what was observed in canon, and^something^something death of the author.
      ```

  - u/alliumnsk:
    ```
    I do not think that lifespan from killings is randomly redistributed to living people, nothing in DN suggests this.
    ```

    - u/bacontime:
      ```
      Refer to my quote above. That rule is canon, but unknown to the characters in the story. 

      Also, consider this: *The Shinigami are not actually gods of death.*

      The vast majority of deaths happen without their influence. They don't shepherd souls to any afterlife. They barely have any power to influence the world at all. 

      What they are is a species of magical parasite. They sit around and occasionally drain some lifespan if they are about to run out. 

      So the Death Note's  primary cosmic function  is  as a feeding tube  for shinigami. A magical lifespan transfer device. 

      Why should this primary function stop working when the book is brought to earth?
      ```

      - u/alliumnsk:
        ```
        >Why should this primary function stop working when the book is brought to earth?

        Well there could be reasons. But humans probably lack something which allows them to feed in that way.
        For shinigami themselves, its primary function probably functions as well on earth.
        ```

        - u/bacontime:
          ```
          True. And like I mentioned in another comment, the lifespan being lost into the aether is more likely to be what the author intended.

          My point is just that there are textual elements which suggest conservation of lifespan as a plausible mechanism, even for human users. 

          Plus, it's an interesting hypothetical.

          *Edit*: I'll add that my headcanon is that the reason shinigami die when they save someone is that their lifespan gets transferred out of them. And that humans are similar enough to shinigami to use the Death Note and benefit from transferred lifespan, but different enough that the targetting mechanism gets messed up. But that's complete imagination on my part and has no textual support.

      Out of curiosity, what's your stance on the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem)?

      - Would you pull a lever if it made a train run over 1 guy instead of 5?
      - Would you push a fat guy under the train to make it stop before it hits 5 people down the line?
      - If you were a rural doctor with multiple dying patients, and an innocent dude walked into your village, and you could save 5 patients by harvesting his organs, would you?

      I have no opinion on the issue one way or another, I'm still trying to figure it out, so I'm curious what are some good arguments pro/against that? 

      What would you do with the Death Note? Would you ever use it at all?

      - u/Silver_Swift:

        > Out of curiosity, what's your stance on the trolley problem?

        I like [Eliezers answer](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K9ZaZXDnL3SEmYZqB/ends-don-t-justify-means-among-humans), though I don't know that I fully agree with it.

        If you really pushed me on it, I would say something along the lines that, yes, there is a moral distinction between killing people and letting them die and sacrificing someone else for the greater good is not a morally defensible decision.

        That said, you can always make the thought experiment dramatic enough to make my intuitions flip the other way (sacrifice one innocent guard to prevent an omnicidal villain from getting to the nuclear launch codes), so my position is mostly that I don't really know and that we shouldn't judge people being put into impossible decisions whichever way they go. 

        >What would you do with the Death Note? Would you ever use it at all?

        Me personally? Definitely not. I don't have the stomach for using a weapon that powerful in a consistent enough manner to yield net utility for the world, so even from an extremist utilitarian position I would reject using it. Can I imagine a mostly good, mostly rational character that would decide to use the Death Note? Yes (and I would read the hell out of that story).

          > I can't occupy the *epistemic state* you want me to imagine.

          Although Eliezer meant it differently, this has long been the crux of the matter to me with a lot of these thought experiments. The situations they use don't embody the pure, crystalline dichotomy that is being claimed. Then people add things like the fat-man variant, where a random person asked the question is going to be influenced, likely subconsciously, by a whole lot of aspects that are then projected by academics onto unqualified claims about utilitarianism and deontology.

          Sticking to likely, relatable models seems a lot truer to me, like discussing sending people to war, or experimental variants; [one article I found that talks about a mice study](https://slate.com/technology/2018/06/psychologys-trolley-problem-might-have-a-problem.html) points out:

          >  when presented with a more realistic scenario, people are more inclined to sacrifice an individual for the benefit of the group

          I think this validates my suspicions.

          That lasted *months*, and it was terrible, mostly because a lot of people really, really think that free speech should be the driving consideration for every mod decision, or are worried that it's a slippery slope to arbitrarily removing people for expressing their views, or are worried that there will be chilling effects, that wrong and/or vile views should be met head-on with vocal debate, etc. All valid concerns, IMO, but it requires this place to turn into "debate a Nazi" with far too much frequency for my tastes, which really gets in the way of our core mission (sharing and discussing rational fiction).

          Part of the issue was that someone like that can toe the line fairly closely and take advantage of every mechanism in place to ensure that people get a fair shake and mods don't act too hastily. It's arguing for white nationalism in such a way that you're being as oblique as possible, until eventually you slip up and say that you want to kill the Jews.

          In the future, I'll be more vocal about advocating for immediate ban. The whole thing left a very bad taste in my mouth.

        Well there was a period where we'd get a few comments about conservatives being moral mutants that should all be sterilized for the survival of ethnic minorities, which would turn into debates about the appropriateness of violence and whether conservatives are even evil to begin with, etc. The US politics ban put a stop to these (they were only in the Friday threads anyway).

        Nazism and Eugenics are pretty intertwined.  The poster is advocating some of the ugliest and least-supported aspects of eugenics - namely that criminals and criminality are inherited and that therefor all undesirables should simply be killed.  This is a core piece of Nazi mentality and policies.  While historically Nazism was specific to Germany and white supremacy, the *class or mode of thinking* it refers to -- namely that "people like me are good, and not good (ie. not like me) people should be killed" -- is what is at issue here.

            so based on a self-report study of twins saying conscientiousness is 49% effected by genetics vs other factors, you are for murdering all criminals (and before you claim strawman, this is exactly what the Kira thread I criticized was defending.

              And eugenics does not require killing -- simply barring them from reproduction is enough.(when Nazis killed disabled people who wouldn't reproduce anyway this had nothing to do with eugenics).

    I'm not so sure about that. The plan that Light made before he forgot about it relied on predicting how he would act. If knowledge of the Death Note changed him, he would have predicted wrong.

    I think he told Rem to give the Death Note to someone evil and selfish, because only then would Light be motivated to stop him. He even points out to himself and the audience that he could tell the new Kira was a different person because the old Kira had a morality remarkably similar to his own.

      Exactly - his motivation has always been "to personally help mete out justice and fight crime". Before the Death Note, becoming a police officer seemed like the best way to do that. After, he didn't have to work within the system or wait anymore. Same goal, same ethics, different means.

      Not if he was good at modeling his pre-Death-Note-influenced self. You don't have to be a given person to successfully predict a given person's behavior.

      > He even points out to himself and the audience that he could tell the new Kira was a different person because the old Kira had a morality remarkably similar to his own.

      Similar, maybe, but not quite the same. Post-Death-Note Light had basically the same values of pre-Death-Note Light minus all the bits that would make him hesitate to use something like the Death Note.

  If Yagami was an effective altruist, he would've realised that treating the symptoms doesn't cure the disease. He's a lone actor, and he has to be a lone actor due to the murderous nature of his power. That in mind, if he uses the note at all, it is best done as a method to discretely give himself enough wealth to begin distorting the world in his favour via the conventional means of bribery and corruption, and then to use the note to take out major locii of organized criminal networks. Beyond this, targeted execution of certain politicians may have a beneficial effect. Also, he could probably edit society's preferences by using the note to exacerbate problems in media-sensational ways. Suppose Light wasn't to end the Yakuza. Then, he could use the death note to cause a bunch of them to do something outrageous to Japanese sensibilities, while remaining sufficiently within the baliwick of things that it is concievable a Yakuza gangster would do. Perhaps Light believes that weapons are too accessible: he can streamline stricter regulation by scheduling a spate of successful knife and sword attacks in preschools.

  There's all kinds of levers to move society in a Death Note, if you're rational enough to consider it's potential, and disgusting enough to actually use them. The lesson for us here is that Light was a Level Hollywood Intelligent character.

  The problem is that, contrary to famous historical figures, death solves very few important problems. Effective altruism is aimed at doing good most efficiently, so death note isn't a great tool for it. 

  Many of the people you might think to kill first, are *also* holding things together while they're awful. Western capitalist republics and all the high living standards they have aren't the result of a mere lack of dictators. Rather they're the result of a cultural value system that most people in the west share. People on both right and left generally agree that we have a right to life liberty and pursuing our individual happiness. We generally agree that individual freedoms/autonomy are important even when we disagree on specifics. We generally agree that all people have value and some minimum amount of 'human rights' even when we disagree what exactly those rights should be. We generally praise people who work hard, are frugal, and are generous towards others.

  Kill a dictator creating a power vacuum in a country which has neither these shared values, nor the prosperity required to allow the vast majority of people to survive *while being virtuous* (i.e. not stealing to eat), and you won't get our results. Unfortunately you can make very little headway towards instilling virtues and a culture that leads to prosperity with death. 

  If it were me, I'm not even certain that I'd use it to say, kill all the radical terrorist imams. If I were aggressive and successful enough, maybe it slow their roll a bit, but it's not a long term solution because killing them doesn't destroy the philosophy. So in a few decades when I'm not paying attention, the ideas will come back and I won't be around to stop them--then what? The antidote to bad philosophy can only be a convincing case for good philosophy. 

  If not terrorist leaders and dictators, who else do we know the names of that we could righteously kill? At best you're playing The Punisher and killing people after their crimes. But you're not solving the problems that create more criminals. 

  Life is suffering *by default*. If you wake up naked and alone in the woods and every person and human creation has been removed from the planet, you're going to have a bad time. Death is just the capstone on that suffering. Most people aren't so evil that early death is a solution in any but the most cynically twisted way.

    I think the context makes this different to traditional assassinations or warfare. If corrupt leaders reliably commit suicide writing "I REPENT" in their own blood, it will have an effect.

    On top of this, attacks can have a protective role. One of the major inhibitors of good people in bad societies is simply that the bad people aren't afraid to use violence, and jail or kill their competitors. God's wrath descending on the perpetrators is at the very least going to act as *some* kind of protection against this, and likely legitimize those protected by it in the eyes of the populace.

    The "only words can fight words" thing is an addictive phrase, but I think we've seen a fair bit of evidence that actually you can fight philosophies with bullets. The thoughts don't live in the air, or even the books, they have to be carried and transmitted through human brains, and if you take out the right ones you stop the spread. This is especially true from extremes like "kill all the radical terrorist imams".

      The main issue with the "divine wrath" angle is that once people begin expecting it, the absence of it will be seen as divine endorsement, even if what's really going on is the death note holder wasn't paying attention.

    Which is why Kira wanted a legacy - other people using the note is the obvious thing to set up for after he dies. Living on as an idea that gives the followers of other ideas heart attacks isn't necessarily a terrible plan, just an evil one.

  I guess he would kill rich people and make them donate their fortunes to effective charities. He might preferentially target evil rich people, other things being equal, but it would not be a priority.

    This is a bad idea. In the short term it will help some people but in the long run it will seriously damage economy. You are killing people on whom is dependent most of the economy and also people will be increasingly scared of becoming rich. So for some help which is like a drop of water in ocean you destroyed the world economy.

      There are ways around that. Find sick, old rich people and kill them in secret with "natural causes".

      One of the rules in the manga, but not the anime, was that the death had to happen within something like a month of their name being written down. Without that, you could try to use it to make people start living their life in a certain way, until they died at the age of 100, or higher. 

      > and also people will be increasingly scared of becoming rich. 

      Imagine a world where it is a) known that rich people live longer than average, b) by a noticeable margin, or c) to world record level ages.

    I think the point of the show was that he was a megalomaniac who had deluded himself into thinking that what he was doing was for the greater good, as a way of satisfying his god complex and justifying how much pleasure he took in ending lives.

      he didn't start out that way. he wanted to make the world a better place through his brand of justice.  i think the tools that he used to improve the world did end up corrupting him.  you see that some people like him and thought he was making the world a better place.

      &#x200B;

      sure he grew a god complex but only after he started down that path
      ```

      - u/tjhance:

        I think he proclaimed that he would be a god in episode 1. (admittedly, he had already killed some people by that point, but this was still pretty early)

          From episode 1:

          >Light: At first, I wrote the names of the worst criminals I could think of. Like I was cleaning up the world, one name at a time, so that eventually no one will ever do anything evil again. And while the truly guilty ones who deserve to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks, the people who are less guilty but who still make trouble for others will slowly be erased through disease and accidental death. Then and only then the world will start moving in the right direction. It'll be a new world, free of injustice, and populated by people who I've judged to be honest, kind, and hardworking.

          > Ryuk: But if you did that, it would make you the only bad person left.

          > Light: Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about. I'm a hard working honor student considered to be one of Japan's best and brightest. And I… I will become the God of this New World.

          I think it's *kind of* ambiguous, depending on how many people you think Light killed before he got to this end state that he more or less stays in through the whole series, but if there's a character arc there, a corruption through the use of the Death Note, it's mostly implied, and contained entirely within that first episode. "Power corrupts" certainly doesn't seem to be the driving theme of the show to me, because Light is a megalomaniac basically from the end of the first episode onward, and debateably before that.
          ```

          - u/anewhopeforchange:
            ```
            that sounds exactly like he starting down a utilitarian path.  get rid of all the criminals through obvious ways and undesirables through accidents.

            &#x200B;

            wanting to make the world a better place (same goals as EA and hes very rational) through the use of force (the death note) is inevitably going to lead down a path of corruption. it doesn't matter how good your intentions are, or even how rational you are.

            &#x200B;

            the path starts the moment he decides that hes going to make the world a better place through the killing of others. when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail. when all you have is a death note everyone looks like they should die.

            &#x200B;

            the rest of the show is just the inevitable consequences of the first episode, and Ryuk knows this. he knows that the moment  a human picks ups the book it brings misery and death to the user and everyone around them. this power can only end in death and destruction. the end is preordained and its only the journey that is interesting.

            &#x200B;

            at first he starts with criminals and saving people then the second a problem shows up he immediately tries to solve it with the death note. he knows L isn't bad he knows the cops aren't bad but he kills them anyway because he is going to do good in the world and they are stopping him therefor they are bad. your with him or your against him.

            &#x200B;

            i think the main issue is that he hasn't gone meta. the medium is the message. its the way we go about solving problems that matters not just the problems themselves. 

            &#x200B;

            you cant solve the worlds problems by forcing it. you try to kill to solve problems you create a world where people kill to solve their problems. change comes from within.

            &#x200B;

            sure you can give me a examples where violence solves problems but in general (there are probably lots of real life edge cases)  you are probably creating more problems then you are solving. your solution is worse than the problem.

            &#x200B;

            sure hes got flaws who doesn't? what separates the normal person from becoming a tyrant is that they have to contend with others. if a power dynamic is overly tipped to one side then the one with the power will not care about the other. there is no reason to, from a game theory point of view.

            &#x200B;

            sure you can give exceptions people with power who doesnt abuse it but it is the exception the proves the rule. a good tyrant is a rare thing.

            &#x200B;

            anyway the way i see it is that the whole show is about his journey down this path, starting as a model person and ending with making the whole world a worse place.
            ```
