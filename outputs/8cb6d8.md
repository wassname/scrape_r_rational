## [D] Mother of Learning: Does the time loop destroy souls?

### Post:

Everyone knowledgeable about soul magic is very clear that souls can't be destroyed; priests, Alanic, everyone. As we understand the time loop so far, the Controller (assume it's Zach, for now) has their "real" soul pulled into the loop and everyone else in the loop is a construct. All fine so far.

However, what happens to everyone else's soul when the loop expires? Alanic's, Kael's, Silverlake's, everyone's? The time loop seems to have created a soul for everyone in the world, every restart, and souls can't be destroyed, so what happens to them?

It is, of course, possible that the time loop creates a sort of "fake" soul, which is good enough while you're in the time loop but not otherwise. However, this seems unlikely. These "fake" souls seem plausibly enough like real souls that soul magic works on them fine; Quatach-Ichl was able to "blend" Zach's "real" soul with Zorian's "fake" soul well enough to put the marker into it; the Guardian is pretty clear that it would be possible to smuggle copies out of the time loop by switching the copy's "fake" soul with the "real" soul of the real person in the real world. So my assumption here is that the copies of everyone in the time loop have actual souls. They don't have the actual souls of the "real" versions of people outside the time loop, though, otherwise the Guardian wouldn't be worried. So what happens to these souls when the time loop shuts down?

It's possible that the time loop created a soul for everyone else in the world and reuses those souls with every restart, but that also seems unlikely; Zorian points out explicitly that mages would experience their shaping skills improving over time if their time-loop soul were re-used on every restart rather than created from scratch. (And this would still have the question of "what happens to those souls?", just at the end of the whole time loop rather than with every restart.)

It's also possible that the Sovereign Gate (because it's just *that* good, i.e., divinely created) actually can destroy souls, and does so at the end of every restart; Alanic etc just don't know this is possible (and probably it isn't if you're not the gods). But this seems a bit unlikely, and not very justified by the text.

So, this all suggests that the time loop creates a new soul for everyone in the world with every restart. What happens to those souls at the end of a restart, since they can't be destroyed? That's the big question, here.

Notes:

(There are quite a few assumptions in here, of course, about whether people's stated views are actually correct, about the nature of the time loop, and so on. Of course /u/nobody103 Knows The Truth, but discussion of this might be a spoiler and therefore not for him to pronounce on :-))

  [Actual quote](https://motheroflearninguniverse.wordpress.com/2017/08/10/brief-absence/#comment-4889) from /u/nobody13:
  >The time loop mechanism completely ignores the part about souls being indestructible. When the pocket universe is destroyed, everything in it (other than souls tagged with a valid marker) is destroyed along with it. Souls may be indestructible to in-universe entities, but they still need a universe bound by appropriate rules in order to continue existing.

    Ah! Good find; that answers that question, then!

    Also, based on the context it looks like he's saying they get destroyed every loop. They don't get recycled and just all get destroyed when it ends.
    ```

  We saw with that one weird soul-eating flower that souls are more than just *units*.

  They are complicated magical machines, with many moving parts on top of their 'core' and personally, it seems to me like people having things mixed up. A souls *core* is indestructible, immutable, eternal. But 'you' aren't your core, your core is simply a part of you. Your shaping skills, personality, etc. are all embedded in the architecture of the rest of your soul, which we see is not even close to indestructible.

  Thus, I would propose that the Sovereign gate *is* reusing souls, but is not reusing them *wholesale*. It is stripping them down to their cores and rebuilding them from there following the template, much how it reconstructs everything else.

  My assumption was that they all just died at the end of the month. They should go to wherever regular souls go when they die, leading to a *hell* of a lot of copies of everyone's soul in the afterlife; pun intended.
  ```

    ```
    That would be something, but it is also possible that souls are considered indestructible for humans and divine magics could do what humans can't.
    ```

- u/Dismalward:
  ```
  Well IF the lich did in fact self-destruct his soul then its plausible souls can be destroyed. Now whether they are being destroyed or not that's up to interpretation whether the time loop is a huge illusion with fake copy souls or something else.
  ```

    We don’t know if detonating your own soul actually destroys it. It could just use all available magic the soul produces to cause an explosion, but the soul still remains intact. I doubt the gods would enjoy the idea of villains who, believing they would experience some sort of punishment in the afterlife, are able to escape judgement by soul-suicide.

    I do think the gate is creating new souls and destroying them, which is quite astonishing if you think about it. Even if souls can be destroyed by suicide, it has been stated that there is no known method of offensively destroying another’s soul. This means the Sovereign Gate is the only known device usable by mortals that can create and destroy a soul. Which makes Eldemars research into it even more troubling. If mastered, the device has the potential of basically granting god-like powers to it’s user.

      Agreed that it's astonishing if true, yeah. I'm slightly surprised that Alanic hasn't thought of this, as well.

- u/AStartlingStatement:
  ```
  It's specifically stated that the world inside the portal is cut off from the divine, there is no contact with the gods, etc. That would include heavens/hells. 

  So even if the souls are real they are not going to an afterlife at the end of each loop. Presumably they are erased and then created again. Or possibly just reset and used over. If it's the latter they would have to be eventually destroyed at the end of the simulation anyway.
  ```
