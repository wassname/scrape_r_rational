## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  **NSFW** **(Seriously)**

  Tales of Mu was recently recommended to me as "there's lots of worldbuilding, mostly to facilitate sex". I couldn't really get into it, but found the idea intriguing, since there are lots of erotica tropes about sex, but rarely much in the way of concerted worldbuilding effort. Most of what I've seen are one-of species, spells, potions, or magical effects, with relatively little consideration for the wider implications, sociological impacts, and second-order effects.

  #Sealing

  By ancient magic, any child born is 'sealed', locking them away from so much as the concept of sex until their eighteenth birthday. The sealing is bidirectional, affecting both the sealed and the unsealed. Firstly, if the sealed hear or see anything having to do with sex, it will be locked away from their mind as meaningless fuzz, with the memories imperfectly restored upon unsealing. They have no sexual desire whatsoever, even if they're physically sexually developed (e.g. when they're seventeen years old and three-hundred and fifty-five days old). Further, they take no pleasure whatsoever from stimulation of any kind. Secondly, the unsealed have no attraction whatsoever to the sealed, and have an instinctive desire to shield the sealed from viewing or hearing about sex. This comes with a complete revulsion toward so much as the idea of interacting with the sealed in a sexual way, with a strong preference toward clinical description if absolutely necessary.

  On a person's eighteenth birthday, they'll fall into a deep sleep that lasts for roughly eighteen hours. When they wake up, any memories of people talking about sex, having seen sex, or other blank spots will be partially (and non-traumatically) restored. Additionally, unsealing day is usually accompanied by sexual urges at the extreme end of normal.

  Sealing extends beyond humanoid society, impacting the wider world as well. Sealed are completely immune to the entirety of sexual-magical effects, from the predations of sexual monsters, from sexual diseases, and from nearly anything that would cause them to have sexual pleasure, and stimulate them in a way that would be sexual. Further, most sexual monsters will instinctively avoid the sealed and not engage in sexual activity when within range of the sealed.

  Knock-on effects: Children have a warding effect against the monsters that roam the wilds, so are often brought along on merchant caravans, on ships, or in other circumstances where monster attacks would be more common. Children sometimes have shifts manning the city walls, usually children supplied by orphanages. Similarly, there are childrens’ adventuring guilds in some nations, as children have a quite different experience of the world from adults, one which protects and shelters them.

  Unsealing tends to be something of an event, marking an entrance into true adulthood, though the circumstances vary by culture. Because the unlocking of memories is somewhat scattershot, the unsealed need to be introduced to the world as it actually is, and must learn norms, rituals, and expectations at a fairly rapid pace, especially as there's no effective way to prepare them for it.

  #Mana

  Males produce 'essence' when they orgasm, which can be captured by any close-by (touch-range) unsealed female, who then uses a simple spell to process it into small pearls of 'mana', with some residual magic left behind. This mana is extraordinarily useful for many things, which helps to incentivize sex. Further, residual mana has benefits for the woman, fulfilling biological functions (allowing her to go without food or drink, repairing the effects of aging, healing injuries, boosting immune system) and increasing sex drive and sexual arousal. A woman who has quite frequent sexual intercourse can subsist exclusively on mana, sometimes even forgoing sleep. Men get no benefits from sex besides pleasure.

  Mana can be used to:

  * Make things grow. This mostly applies to crops, which get the most benefit per unit mana. Properly cast, a single pearl can increase crop yield over an acre by 50%, with sharply diminishing returns. Typically, each acre will get three castings per planting.
  * Similarly, a heavy burst of mana can be used to enormously accelerate the growth of a single individual plant, with much better diminishing returns, turning a sapling into an enormous old-growth tree in a matter of hours. This magic can also be used on animals, growing them at a greatly accelerated rate, though it’s rarely done given the mind doesn’t advance with the body. Use on people is non-functional, and impossible on a sealed individual.
  * Enhance awareness. Using a pearl of mana as a focus, a witch can enhance her senses, typically one at a time, as two or more requires extra skill and concentration. Sometimes this is used for sexual pleasure by enhancing the sense of touch. Witches are often used as sentries, and are capable of producing fine artisanal works.
  * Engage kinetics. Witches can fire off kinetic blasts for both defense and offense, and if they’re skilled, can even apply kinetics to themselves in order to fly. Use of kinetics can drain the pearls fairly quickly, so flight is mostly used for short distances rather than long ones, or in those cases in which it’s acceptable to burn lots of mana.

  Knock-on effects:

  * Improving crop yields means saving on the labor necessary for keeping people fed. This is good, because a lot of the world has dangerous beasts or environmental hazards, and fields usually need to be fenced in. Better yields also mean that society can support ancillary professions at lower population densities, and in high densities, can afford more specialization.
  * Kinetics mean that witches have powerful offense, while flight means that they have fast response times. This makes witches the natural police of the world, capable of taking out any criminals.

  #The Plane of Cocks

  In a similar way that other settings might have a plane of elemental fire or a plane of elemental earth, there exists a plane of cocks. If you were to go there, you would see rolling hills of cocks, some spaced close together and others far apart. These cocks come in all varieties, some large and some small, but most average. Each of these cocks is functional, in the sense that it will grow erect when stimulated and ejaculate when given enough stimulation. To all tests that have been done, these cocks are not in fact attached to anything, and exist simply by themselves, part of the landscape of the plane. Interestingly, the ejaculations do produce mana, though somewhat less than from an actual male.

  Travel to the plane of cocks takes a great deal of both mana and magical expertise, and is more of a curiosity than actually useful, except by those witches who might be constrained by the number of cocks available to them in the prime plane.

  On the other hand, the plane of cocks is instrumental in a number of magics on the prime plane, including the cock portals, a number of magics that allow the growth of a cock, and various others. Similarly, there are methods of transportation available to a witch that allow for fast travel through the plane of cocks, making it instrumental in the fabric of the world.

  #Potionmaking

  Potions have many different effects, though most of them are biological in nature. Potion-making is a process-based skill, one which takes ingredients and processes as inputs and returns potions with various effects as outputs. A master potion-maker can tweak and adjust their potion in various ways, increasing or decreasing duration, effects, and other parameters. With that said, potion parameters mostly have to be guessed at, and there’s always some risk that a brand new potion will act in unpredictable ways, or will fail to work at all.

  Some potion effects:

  * Hair growth/removal
  * Body changing (permanent/temporary)
  * Healing/regrowing (pricey)
  * Sex-related (erections, lubrication, semen volume, etc.)

  Some potionmakers have potions that will transform them into beasts at a moment’s notice. Such potions are a rarity, since they’re mildly dependent on personal biology and bodily metrics, so don’t work for everyone. Some potion makers also have gender-bending potions, which are a bit more common.

  Healing potions are expensive, but can fix almost any problem, so long as they’re formulated right. There are very few people with missing limbs, as those can be regrown with potions, something which is expensive but worth it in the long run, and typically funded by a kingdom.

  #Cock Rings

  A “cock ring” is a small ring, between five inches and eight inches in circumference, which, once activated, will have a cock from the Plane of Cocks come through it. This cock can be used like any other, and typically gets used by women who don’t otherwise have enough cock in their life, or as a way of having a non-threatening marital aid. When they ejaculate, there is some production of mana, but far less than from a normal cock. Because of the mana cost to create one of these cock rings, they are primarily used for satisfaction rather than the production of mana, since there are generally enough normal human cocks available. Some of these cock rings have attachments on them, whether that be a handle for easier insertion, a flared base for anal insertion, or a special attachement for use as a strap-on.

  #Agriculture

  Most food in this world is sexual in nature. This includes aphrodisiacs, things for women to fuck, things for men to fuck, sexual stimulants, lubricants, and all kinds of things. Some of these uses take some preparation, and not every single thing in the entire world is sexual in every way, but it’s very common.

    #Mages

    Like witches, mages also use mana, though they cannot collect it themselves. Unlike a witch, the mage can only use his own essence, which must be collected by a woman and then given over to him. For this reason, wizards often have one or two assistants who can collect their essence when needed. Also for this reason, most mages will push their appetites as far as they can go, doing what they can to lower their refractory period and increase the number of times they can ejaculate in a day, which usually involves increasing their baseline sexual desire.

    Where witches have their own powers largely focused on growth and kinetics, a wizard’s power largely revolves around materials, whether that be creating them from nothing, or enhancing them in some way. A mage can use a decade of their essence to erect an enormous cathedral overnight, or a week to create a small cottage. Aside from what they can do with mundane materials, a mage can also imbue mundane objects or materials with special properties, which vary depending on the specialty of the mage.

    Unfortunately, it takes a significant amount of time and effort for a mage to become any good at magic, which limits their numbers immensely, especially since that same essence they generate could be used by the witches in order to grow crops. Nevertheless, most kingdoms will have a small handful of mages on staff, tasked with either building or making metamaterials.

    Of note, a mage can increase the power of their essence by holding onto it while at a place with a good enough view of as much surrounding land as possible, for unclear reasons. The need for these viewpoints limits mages even further, but for this reason, most mages will use their powers of construction to make a tall tower for themselves as their first major act of magic. This collection does not work if two mages attempt to collect from the same field of view, which they can tell, and usually negotiate.

    Some examples of metamaterials:

    * A helm that’s harder to break without becoming brittle
    * A sword that’s sharper than possible with tools
    * A cloak that’s resistant to fire
    * A dress that’s completely waterproof
    * A set of pants that fit the form of the wearer
    * A net that never gets tangled
    * A dagger that curves through the air when thrown
    * A bow that fires as though it had three times the draw
    * A frictionless dildo
    * A dildo that moves on its own
    * A dildo whose size can be changed
    * A dildo that can change temperature
    * A small homunculus capable of following rudimentary commands

    Knock-on effects:

    * Elite soldiers (usually witches) are outfitted with metamaterials making them more effective in combat.
    * Because different mages have different metamaterial specialties, there needs to exist some kind of network of wizards where they can hand metamaterial objects back and forth to double or triple power them.
    * Mages need to be not just mages but architects and artisans as well, or failing that, they need to have architects and artisans that they can do serious consultation with. Because mages spend a lot of their time not really doing anything, it makes a lot of sense for them to pick up a trade as well.
    * There are going to be a lot more huge buildings around the world, if they take so much less capital and labor to construct
    * Depending on the variables, there will be less use for mines, if a mage can just make a knife or sword or horseshoe out of nothing. Probably not possible given the scales involved though. Probably not desirable to get rid of mines, from a worldbuilding perspective.
    Mages can either be hoarders, not using their stored essence until it’s on something big, or they can be day-to-day or week-to-week, only keeping a limited stockpile for the jobs on hand. The former would make more sense with a patron, while the latter would make more sense in a capitalist economy.
    * Mages build their mage towers out in the middle of nowhere, more often than not. This doesn’t make mages recluses, because they probably have a small staff with them, one or two attendants, some artisans, and maybe a few others.
    * It’s hard to bootstrap as a mage, which is part of the reason why so few people are mages. You need time and effort, plus all the collected essence, which is why it’s mostly an upper class thing, except for a few rare cases. A kingdom could create a mage’s college and pay for young men to become mages, but they might not have the incentive to do so depending on how high the cost is, whether there’s a bloc of existing mages who oppose such a thing, and what the actual benefits are.

      Neat ideas. I'm going to assume that the discovery of magic has been somewhat recent, on an evolutionary timescale, because I think there would be some extremely strong selection pressures in various areas. Any population that had men with a shorter refractory period, or who were more easily stimulated to orgasm, would fairly quickly outcompete their rivals. It's hard to predict exactly what would happen, but I think gender ratios at birth would also change from the more or less even ratio we have IRL.

      Men being able to give various benefits to women, including effectively feeding them, by having sex would probably mean that working families would prefer daughters and a smaller number of healthy males, as this would significantly offset food costs and medical hazards.

      Unless condoms or some other method of birth control is handed out by the pound to every person, combined with easier food production and offset food consumption, population would skyrocket whenever other resources aren't significantly limiting expansion. Wars of expansion would be the norm for most of a country's existence.

      Massively boosted plant and animal growth could lead to vastly faster artificial selection, meaning custom species would be common, and probably vary by region. Plants that grow useful materials would quickly be altered to produce more of that material, meaning things like buildings would be made of almost entirely organic materials due to how easy they are to make compared to things like rocks. Metallurgy would be a hard field to advance when bone and engineered wood are readily available materials. This further limits the utility of mages being able to make buildings, although it could be useful for temporary structures.

      Walls around cities would likely be made from trees, as trees are easy to make, hard to climb over, and easy to take down as a city expands or contracts.

      Charcoal would by far be the most common fuel source.

      Women would be soldiers more than men, as they are not the main limiter on a faction's mana generation, and groups of women soldiers could be sent for long treks using men to both heal them of injuries and effectively feed them. This significantly reduces supply lines. Added to the fact that women can be witches, enhancing their scouting, guarding, and combat abilities, men would likely be rare as soldiers.

      Sealing means that there is no weird child rape stuff going on, but male children would likely be heavily pushed to be really, extremely good at cardio and aerobic exercise before they reach 18.  Marathons would be a high school graduation requirement.

      Mages I think would be engineers instead of architects, if the mana requirements seem to mostly scale with the amount of material created instead of the shape of it. Use their magic to make otherwise hard to craft items. Not specifically sure what those would be, given the lack of information, but it seems like the more promising path.

        I don't see too much use from the plane of cocks, aside from the fast travelling, if Mana harvesting from it isn't practical. The only original thought I had for it is that there is apparently a plane of abundant animal parts that are alive and seemingly don't spoil. So, if getting food from agriculture isn't practical at the moment, a witch could travel to the plane of cocks and come back with as much fresh meat as she can carry.

        Giving someone a cockmeat sandwich would be more than just an expression, it would be a gift of great labor. Maybe not blood, sweat, and tears, but sweat and other bodily fluids.

          The plane of cocks could be useful when it comes to warfare depending on how the topology maps out. At the very least, defense outposts and border guards in the plane would be necessary to keep saboteurs and assassins from entering city walls if it's just an overlaid plane.

          It could also see use in expeditions, where a witch skilled enough to open a portal to the PoC, and equipped with enough automatic enchanted fleshlights, would be able to sustain herself indefinitely. The Arctic would be explored and mapped much earlier in relative history than here, for one, as well as spelunking/exploratory mining.

          I respectfully disagree. Depending on the internal structure the plane of cocks would be a heavily contested resource. Compared to men, the cocks on the plane don't expend resources when milked and it is logistically simpler to have a cock farm than a men farm. It is also likely that you could develop machines that could milk many cocks at once, or bring multiple cocks close to orgasm simultaneously so the speed of harvesting mana becomes much improved.

          Edit: Body modifications are possible. I wonder what the shape of a dedicated harvester of mana in the cock plane would look like. You want a lot of appendages to milk as many cocks at once and you would have 'entrances' designed to make ejaculation happen as quickly as possible. I feel like it would have to look nightmarish.

            A writhing mass of tentacles that are tipped with organic fleshlights? I'd imagine there'd be cilia and such inside, some kind of vocal chord like things to produce vibrations. Now that's an erotic nightmare.

    I feel that the idea must have been to create a world in which people had a ton of sex but I honestly don't really think that is what would be happening. Mana comes from ejaculation and the quality of it doesn't seem to be related to pleasure. Female pleasure becomes inefficient. Non-vaginal sex is much faster at reaching the point of ejaculation and I would expect that there would be a bunch of machines that could bring a man close to orgasm just to have the woman touch him when sufficiently close.
    ```

    - u/junipersmith:
      ```
      I feel like worldbuilding is kind of directionless, in the sense that you create rules and then see where they go, without having all that much of a destination in mind. I guess I would also say that this *isn't* about maximizing the amount of sex, it's about maximizing the variety and quantity of unique sexual scenarios available to write/think about. (Per machines, I don't think that's much of a concern, but I might be overestimating how difficult such a machine would be to make. Pretty sure that you would just have the men manually stimulating themselves, if speed was your primary concern, which it probably wouldn't be given that you're much more limited by refactory period.)

    Why an instinct to hide sex from sealed if they can't understand it anyway?

    You're basically talking another language so it seems weird to me that they'd make sealed cover their ears when you talk about sex even though ears uncovered they don't hear it

    Also how do leap years work? How does it work in space? What if you've been frozen? What about hormonally stunted people or people with delayed puberty? What about mentally handicapped people?

    Seems to me if you're going to have a mechanic so you can't get in legal trouble you should just make a god of consent or something who gets involved in all cases.

    But I guess it's OK to write about rape and murder as long as they're adults so not consent. God of legal protection

      My guess is that it's actually some number of hours and that though the intent of whatever casted the ancient magic was to shield the young and innocent, it doesn't work out perfectly.
