## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Is anyone here familiar with stock trading?

  I just finished writing the first draft of a Twig fanfic that includes some financial technobabble, and I'd appreciate anyone who could help me make the financiababble more realistic.

    What kind of financial talk? I don't know much about investment banking, but wallstreetbets is pretty fun.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Stuff like "Oh no! This person bought too many shares at a price too low! It looks like there's a conspiracy going on!"
      ```

      - u/TacticalTable:
        ```
        I'd definitely advise hanging around wallstreetbets, because they speak almost _entirely_ in jargon, though it's pretty hard to buy shares of something for too low of a price on an open market situation. I'd imagine this would come out of an insider trading situation or private investment situation, where a company authorized the sale of more shares, either through dilution or expanding shareholder stake in the company. That would only reasonably be explained by board member collusion or previously unknown information that the buyer had access to (Perhaps they found damaging information, and promised not to release it for a stake in the company?)

  Does anyone have a good place or advice for how to show a medieval kingdom gradually descending into anarchy? I mean what does anarchy actually look like and how long would it realistically last?

    This depends on which type(s) of anarchy you're talking about. For example, with [anarcho-syndicalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-syndicalism), it would be characterized by the commoners starting to organize and forming democratically-run guilds, unions, or syndicates, depending on what you want to call them. The unions would help to ensure the rights of their members, and help to arrange for societal needs in their local community. Furthermore, these unions start building a superorganization, a federation of unions that span the entire kingdom, and possibly beyond, something like the [CNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederaci%C3%B3n_Nacional_del_Trabajo). This organization would begin addressing societal concerns on an even larger scale, effectively supplanting any need for a national government. When it becomes powerful enough, it would start progressively pushing the government to cede power, and the landlords to cede property, aiming to ultimately eliminate the state and capitalism, leaving only a democratic worker's collective. If its demands aren't met, it would declare a [general strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike). Rents and taxes would no longer be paid, workers would stop working for their bosses (though they might still take over workspaces and use them for free), deeds and titles might be seized and burned, etc. The entire country would be reorganized, much like what happened during the [Spanish Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Revolution_of_1936). An uprising of this sort naturally created immense concern among the ruling elites in several European powers, and they ended it with Italy and Germany supporting Spanish fascists to crush the rebellion while the Soviet Union did the same with the Spanish Republicans.

    If you're talking about [Anarcho-communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism), then it would be similar to the above except with the creation of peasant communes instead of unions. As before, it would be a series of local democratic organizations that join in a federation to supplant any need for a state. Multitudes of such communes would work with each other to gradually encompass the entire working force of the region, much like what happened with [Makhnovia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makhnovia). This ended as you might expect, with the government seeing this as a threat and using the army to eliminate it.

    If you're talking about [insurrectionary anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurrectionary_anarchism), then the aim would be more like a constant attack on the institutions that the ruling class uses to maintain power. Insurrectionary anarchists aren't necessarily trying to build any formal societal organizations to replace what they're destroying, but rather trying to create informal and ad hoc organizations through a leaderless resistance which essentially turns regions into [temporary autonomous zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone). This could mutate into something more formal if it weakens the ruling class enough, or it could dissolve if an army is brought in, only to return immediately afterwards, creating endless pockets of resistance across the country.

    If you're talking about [anarcho-primitivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism), it would be similar to insurrectionary anarchism, except that the commoners would be trying to destroy the infrastructure and economic developments which made the kingdom possible in the first place. They'd be demolishing bridges, sabotaging carts and wagons, collapsing mines, setting fires to farmland, ports and ships, pillaging warehouses, tearing down lighthouses, etc. Everything that once gave the kingdom the resources and power that it used to oppress the people would be destroyed with the aim of not just causing the kingdom to collapse, but to also prevent any future kingdom from ever rising from its ashes. They'd be intentionally returning their society to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, with all the deaths that would naturally come with such inefficient food gathering techniques (so, obviously, this type of anarchism isn't likely unless conditions for the majority are absolutely horrifying).

    So, to answer your question, it's going to depend on what the kingdom looks like. The fact that it's descending into anarchy is a clear indication that most of the population is *fucking done with* the kingdom, but the exact type of anarchy and how quickly it collapses depends on what the kingdom has been doing to piss people off, and on how effectively it has been isolating the commoners from communicating with each other.

      Thanks for the information! I guess to expand on it, Iâ€™ve been reading some very good fantasy web serials recently like the Wandering Inn, the Iron Teeth, Into the Mire, etc. and got inspired to write up some outlines of my own. The story itself is a horror story that follows 4 characters from a kingdom that are all from different walks of life.

      The King and the eldest prince have recently been killed in battle after invading a neighboring kingdom that broke a peace treaty. This is leading to major power struggles and a civil war between the King's remaining sons is on the horizon. Peasants are struggling from high taxes to pay for the war and a major famine is becoming increasingly likely thanks to a severe drought. While outside the Kingdoms, vengeful elves have started to spread disease and are waiting to take advantage of the kingdom's weakness.

      Suddenly and without warning, all of humanity falls asleep at the same time and they all have the same terrible nightmare that involves vivid depictions of being devoured alive by some kind of alien presence. They awaken to find their bodies changed and filled with the instinctive knowledge of a type of magic. The slow breakdown of society, copious amounts of body horror, monstrous insects showing up, and war ensue as the four characters change along with humanity into something new.

      The main reason anarchy ensues is that no one trusts the nobles/government to protect them and this magic means that governments no longer have a monopoly of force. A peasant using this magic can potentially become powerful enough that they can take on a small army and EVERY human being now knows this magic instinctively.

      This magic has nasty side effects and huge risks but peasants all over the kingdom were forced to use this magic to fight off elven raids, avoid starvation, and cure a nasty plague spread by the elves. Then the kingdom goes into civil war between the princes and armies try to "forage" near villages only to be beaten back. A peasant revolt ensues that wins but no one really trusts anyone else, there is a lot of conflicting information and rumors, the local church just declared it the end of the world, there are giant insects appearing thanks to the magic everyone is using, and it becomes village against village for a while until the main characters stabilize things by organizing people and getting rid of some of the human monsters who turn into actual monsters using this magic as time goes on.

        If you're doing an actual medieval setting, definitely make sure you don't neglect the religious side of things. Religious thought was an utterly massive part of the medieval worldview, and an event like what you're talking about would have been a huge theological crisis as much as anything.

        If you're talking about a descent into chaos, the most realistic in my mind would be to have a massive upswell in popular religious movements, with leaders or holy figures promoting new practices that break from existing church doctrine and heirarchy.
