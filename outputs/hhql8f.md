## The Last Haruspex: Forward

### Post:

My dear son, Artemy, I write to you after so many years apart in the hopes that you may find a way to return to us. There is a prophesy at hand.

It is often said that it is pointless to ask the Haruspex how he comes to know a thing; that you will sooner become lost in the labyrinth of his mind before grasping at a single strand of truth. I hope that throughout your travels you have gained wisdom enough to pierce through the surface of this lie to glean the truth underneath.

I am Menkhu. I am Yargachin. I am Warden of Knowledge and Keeper of Lines; Truth to me is like a disease with a guaranteed transmission rate-- once it is out there is no containing it, for the human spirit knows truth when it hears. Truth strikes the mind as if upon an iron bell; ringing and ringing. Whether it is accepted is another matter entirely, and that very truth will become the divide between the community afterward; the single cleave through which blood must pour.

I have avoided bloodshed all my life. The town forbids all but the Yargachin to wield a blade. I did not understand this law until your grandfather was murdered, and the weight of his position, his Inheritance, was transferred onto my shoulders. I traced the lines back to his killer and spilled blood in recompense. I mended the wounds left in the world, both from my father's death and his killer's too; that his son might not follow in his father's footsteps and wreak vengeance back upon my own line.

The tears that boy shed cleaved my heart into two.

I learned that day, that to spill blood-- even for what we call the greater good-- it is a cursed thing, Artemy. Even as the surgeon seeks to heal, the scalpel is still a blade.

Overseer Ty-cheek and Foreman Oyun, leaders of the Kin that bind us by blood, leaders you have met as a young boy and may soon meet again-- have both counseled me over the years that the path of strength is what Mother Boddho requires of me. "How can it be," they say, "that a Yargachin, a butcher, might avoid spilling blood?" And yet still did I boast how my finger alone could trace the lines of flesh and come away clean.

Yet now...

I trust that you have found your way to the tradition of Tarot? I tell you this: the Tower must fall. Our town is bound by a tenuous peace; between the three ruling powers-- Kain, Olgimsky, and Saburov; between the Polyhedron which reaches for the Sky and the Kin who rise from the Earth; between each individual's decision to avoid splitting open flesh, knowing that the first person to do so gives license for every other to do the same... We have peace and equilibrium, yes. But we stack our hopes and dreams, our safety and security, all upon each other... reaching higher and ever higher that most do not see the fragile foundations that lay at their feet.

The Tower must fall, and may Bos Turokh be merciful when it does. 

I am older and wiser than I have ever been my son. It is often said that it is a fruitless endeavor to wonder how the Haruspex comes to know a thing. I tell you now that the line which draws peace is a false path. Believe me when I say that blood is compulsory to a surgeon. For all of the mysticism and honor that shrouds the role of the Haruspex, you must know that in the end, we are only human. We can only act within our bounds.

This is the first thing you must learn, if you are ever to surpass them.

I tell you this to say that I am no longer afraid of blood, my son. To spill blood is a cursed thing-- and yet while the Haruspex lives is it compulsory; a curse that we must bear. For I tell you, there is a worse fate than mere death. I am no longer afraid of bloodshed, my son. I am instead beset by the thought that I might fail to pass on my role.

Make haste, Artemy. I truly need you.

Your loving father, Isidor Burakh.

    This comes to mind, read recently (PGtE):

  Can we please get some details about what this story is going to be about, and why it's considered rational?

  I'd probably extend some credit to a familiar face, but this seems to be your first post anywhere on Reddit.

    This is Pathologic fanfiction, so fortunately the words aren't made up by OP.

    The only word I can see that is made up and not a proper name is Yargachin. So I'm not seeing it.
