  I like how Ana just blindly jumps to the conclusion that this fleet is coming to destroy the Islands. It'd be just as smart a move to just blockade the islands, to siege out a surrender and strategic territory concessions from the government. And it'd be just as much as a big threat justifying continuing to work with the Guardians. But she has to go harder.

  It shows that it's not just Ana being biased towards her country and her favoured institutions. No, her response to learning about a threat is to jump to the most catastrophized, existential conclusion possible and she forgets about her doubts and circles the wagons in response. This is the difference between just beng indoctrinated and someone beng outright reactionary.

  It easily lead to a massive own-goal too. Because imagine if this wasn't actually an attack, but just saber-rattling on part of the Shenti. But the Guardians *think* it's an attack, so they strike first without even bothering with diplomacy. Boom, suddenly they've escalated the situation to outright war.

  And to the surprise of absolutely no one, Tunnel Vision is three steps ahead of Paragon's best and brightest.

  Also, and I feel like a bit of a broken record here, it's so painful seeing Ana getting so *close* to understanding what exactly Paragon stands for and how little they value her, only to shy away at the last minute. If this is true:
  > Killing my best friend would be easy for her.

  > *This is how they see all their citizens, isn’t it?*

  And this is true:
  >  I had a duty to this nation, to the people here, to keep them safe from the monsters within.  Even if I was a nobody.  Even if I was an insignificant mercenary, pointless next to the almighty Guardians around me.  Even if some parts of the Principality didn’t deserve to be saved.

  Then why are you fighting on behalf of the people that you *know* don't care about their citizens? Fighting for the country and fighting for the government are not the same thing.

    She's been indoctronaited for years (since birth?) that Paragon = good, that if she wants to be an Exemplar she needs to be one of them. I don't think she's capable of honestly assessing the system she's supporting, because it means admitting a large part of her life choices were just wrong.

    Anyways, I always thought the endgame would begin with Ana realizing that she was caught between peace & order through oppression, or liberty and equality through revolution. But at this point I think she might very well die believing in the former.
