  This is the first half of a two-part batch, split up because otherwise it would be almost 72K words, which is too much all at once in terms of both reading and editing. The next "half" will be posted Saturday at 8PM Central (or 48 hours earlier if you're an early bird on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/alexanderwales)). If you'd prefer, you can think of it as two large chunks of writing in close succession, rather than being 'split': I don't plan to do it again, but it worked out a lot better for me.

  AO3 version [is here,](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/57405361) if you prefer that. Or, if you want, the story [is now on my website](http://alexanderwales.com/), with [the first chapter of the batch here.](http://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-196/)

      narratively  there seem to be many checkov's guns firing. 

      Anglycan plotline resolved, massive power, wealth, and magic items acquired, locus (kinda) resolved, now going after the big exclusions. We are in the endgame.
      ```

      - u/AnimaLepton:
        ```
        In terms of actual quests, we still have a fair number, plus magic like star magic. DnD level-wise, you're effectively a god at level 20, and Juniper is nearly at that point, but it's a long way to go before his power are 'natural' rather than dependent on souls (and side note, I'm glad that the unicorn bones were addressed in text- for a limited resource, they're sure getting used very liberally). Last time that everything was explicitly listed out was Chapter 138 Stats for Nerds II. It's not guaranteed that all of these will be addressed by the end, or that Fel Seed will be the final arc. I don't know what else will be done with Fenn, the elves, and her canceled quest. Let me know if I missed any quests below- The quest list hasn't changed all that much.

        God Botherer

        The Lost King, Found? - only thing of note is that the five other dream skewered who arrived around the same time as Arthur were mentioned as being relevant to this quest.

        Through the Lashing Glass- a separate exclusion zone for some reason, which made me think they might tackle it earlier. Even the Risen Lands was an exclusion zone, although it was low level/the dangers came from other people more than the undead.

        All 13 Exclusion Zones under Slayer of Horrors. This includes Fel Seed, Captain Blue, and Doris Finch. It includes areas that have had tangential topics brought up in passing, like the elves' Celestar research and the immortal farming guy brought up in this batch. It includes areas that haven't been brought up at all since first being introduced like the Goblin King. I'm particularly interested in A Door Into the Soul, Better with Loops, Guardian of the Underworld, and Finger of the Sun.

        Tragedy of the Commons - cross-planar, definitely feels like an endgame quest. Maybe Captain Blue will detonate a void bomb while he's at it, forcing the issue.

        Birth of a Nation - can progress over time.

        Taking Root - still not complete, even if the locus finally saw some progress. Could still need some time, some additional tasks, or still end in failure.

        The Sound of Silence and The Infinite Library quest also never had an explicit "Quest Complete" notification in the text. But the same is true for "They Say You Can't Go Home Again," so I can't tell if these are complete and we just didn't get the message due to inconsistency/the general abstraction of the game layer, or if all of these are *technically* incomplete plotlines that will come back later. I'm kinda curious about this, because the Anglecynn arc seems "over," Lisi and the clones aside. He's sent out letters to his friends, talked to his mom, and has what he can get of the game notes. There's really nothing left for him if he tries to visit Aerb-Juniper's hometown, so I think the key is the "you had a life, before this." It might not be completed until he really finds out what the world is, if he's actually dead on earth, if he's a simulation, etc. Infinite Library and Sound of Silence definitely have dangling plotlines as well, but again, not sure how relevant they'll actually be.

          IIRC the other 13 are all empersoned ones where the exclusion can be ended by killing the empersoned exclusion. Glassy Fields just has a castle.

      I generally make corrections to AO3 first, then just copy+paste the HTML of the entire chapter later. And no, I don't have an automated way of keeping them all in sync, which is a pain, and why I try to fix as many typos as possible before they go live (when the story is all in one place).

  There's a lot of stuff to love in this batch, but for me, the locus story was the absolute highlight. I hope one of Mary's clones gets to be a druid, I can't wait to see how the locus is finally going to expand its domain or do more beautiful magic shit (I recall the big flower burst in one of the chapters when Joon started whining about the grimdark world, and notice that the loyalty up came when Joon used his own magic to make something beautiful for the locus), I'm looking forward to sweet-talking the Layman. Also

  >“We could find a battery,” I said. “Some fucking enormous source of power and vitality, in whatever form, we could go on a quest to get it, and then hook it up to you somehow, again with me being a little light on specifics at the moment. And when that was done, you’d be able to pour yourself out over these lands.” I sighed. “Not too likely to actually work though, because if we tried to hook you into a rune magic engine, it would be like AC and DC, or, uh, two things that don’t go together where one is systematized and the other is not.” I snapped my fingers. “It would be like trying to integrate Lego with Play-Doh.”

  >The locus huffed slightly.  

  I missed the subtext here on my first read. But imagine if there were some unfathomable source of power and vitality, capable of replacing lost limbs without magic, overcome nearly any obstacle...

  And it were standing next to you droning about rune engines. I'd huff too.

  - u/Executioner404:
    ```
    > I hope one of Mary's clones gets to be a druid

    Huh. I thought this was ridiculous at first, but this is exactly the kind of fuck-you logic the Locus would employ on a Clone that physically **can't** use magic, desperately wanted to be a Druid but life said she never will be, loves the Locus and their Druid daughter a lot, and wants to do all she can to nurture them and help them grow.

    It was even technically foreshadowed on their first meeting with Solace!

    It's so over the top that I fully went through the stages on it - as soon as he had a name I assumed he was the Captain, then by the end it felt too much and I didn't buy it anymore. 

    OTOH, I've been wrong about what layer this story is playing me on several times already, so.

  - u/GaffitV:
    ```
    My best guess is Blue in the Bottle auto-hops to the nearest zombie when killed because he imparts a part of his soul into each zombie he makes. So the only way to kill him is the churn through all 500,000 zombies in the exclusion zone.
    ```

    - u/DihydrogenM:
      ```
      That's an interesting idea. The warding would have prevented jumping ship, but maybe he's a gestalt entity that is all zombies under his control.
      ```

      - u/havoc_mayhem:
        ```
        > jumping ship

        I see what you did there.
        ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      I actually like this.

      It makes sense as to the reason he was excluded. We have seen a number of exclusions based around the idea of a single person gaining an ability that would allow them to control or possess the whole Hex. Doris Finch and Manifold (manifest? Can't remember) being the main examples.

      So the idea that he has managed to horcrux himself to every single zombie makes sense as to why their creation demanded an exclusion.
      ```

    - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:

      Seems like this kind overlaps with *Murder in Duplicate* tbh. Not that this rules it out as an explanation completely, but on a meta level I'd expect greater diversity among the exclusions

          The Doris Finch quest, which is explicitly about killing a bit over 9 million instances of Doris
          ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    BitB is alive through magic, because he would have died a while ago if not for that. Grak has warder's sight, and warder's sight is both common enough to be widely known, and would in most cases notice a living human suffused with necromantic magic immediately. It's a good thought but I don't think it works out practically even disregarding what BitB would hope to gain from a Gambit like that.
    ```

    - u/zconjugate:
      ```
      It's possible that it's not continuously applied magic, but some sort of periodic rejuvenation (though I'm not sure how that would relate to necromancy).
      ```

      - u/cantaloupelion:
        ```
        my theory is old mate BitB has advanced necromantic magics enough that he can freely swap between zombie bodies without needing a phylactery. You kill 'him' and as long as there is a prepared zombie body nearby, he inhabits the new body. in the end you would need to kill some (all?) of the zombies hes has access too in order to kill him permantly. 

        or kill him through a new method

        ```

  - u/dantebunny:
    ```
    It'd be pretty careless of him, but I guess we don't know that he is cautious.

    I was wondering if we'd see another complete upset that compounds on the original "there are actually still people trapped in the bodies" thing. e.g., "the stilted movement of the zombies pretending to work is another layer of pretense and they're capable of all simultaneously and expertly fighting and Captain Blue isn't dead while a zombie remains". Or "he has far more zombies than anyone thought and they've been using void tools to mine further and further, and the exclusion zone continues arbitrarily deep". Or "Captain Blue transferred his consciousness into the dead body of a dragon".
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:
      ```
      The digging idea is great! 

      Void tools seem unlikely though since the Void Beast is closely monitored and they would dramatically effect it compared to weapons.
      ```

      - u/dantebunny:
        ```
        That's fair, although I'm not clear whether use of void tools is directly detectable or it's just the Void Beast's behaviour. In which case if someone had been using void consistently for a long time, their usage might not show up in the data?

    Well I almost see a path to it with the ink-magic device to bring back mice, her soul, the amulate to transform into animals and the new loyalty buff.  Making Fenns body transform requires volition, but I think Mary might be working a path  to annoy Fenn enough she'll haunt her own corpse.

    My pet theory for a long time has been that Fenn will come back in a way tied to Bluebottle. When this quest was brought up by Perisev she speculated about Joon developing "new magic" which would be the last thing to confirm (to her) that he's the new Uther. Bluebottle has his own specific and excluded brand of necromancy which I feel is going to tie in somehow, maybe it counts as bringing someone halfway back from the dead or something, and then another form of magic finishes the process. 

    And now we're finally at the bottle episode, so I get to find out how on/off the mark I was.

- u/sparkc:
  ```
  Something needs to be said about what a brilliant idea it was to have chapter 198 revolve around prepping for the marriage inspector. That did so much to enable such a deeply rich scene.

  It meant you could seamlessly integrate:

  * A mini-recap of their early relationship, 

  * The topic of Fenn (and the little bow that could be tied on that hampering Joonaryllis), 

  * A look at a “what-could-have-been” timeline, 

  * The issue of Maddie and adding both additional insight into that situation as well as exploring 
  how it’s currently affecting Joon’s perception of his relationship with Amaryllis, 

  * The roleplaying conceit and the obfuscation it allows which makes the exploration of all these issues much more natural and much less awkward

  Imagine trying to cover that much ground that efficiently and that elegantly and with that much feeling when it’s a scene with the characters sitting down and just deciding to have a deep conversation. The marriage inspector angle enriched it all so much.

  And outside of that there’s all the other humour and callbacks and just all-round fantastic character writing that had the chapter feeling so tense, heartfelt, titillating and bittersweet.

  Loved it.

    To everyone confused by Pact's rating: it's likely due to the podcast "Deep in Pact", a read along review/discussion podcast for Pact. They joined the Doof!

  My takes on this half-batch:

  * I loved the romance stuff. As Joon says, it's awkward but awkward good instead of bad. I find it cute but also quite realistic (except for the contrived situation, of course).
  * Liked the honest conversation with Grak.
  * I wonder what's the next in the solution to the Locus' situation, and if any exists.
  * What's Capn' BitB about? Does he have an actual body? Can he jump from zombie to zombie?   
  Someone guessed on discord that the exclusion was probably due to whichever method he uses for immortality, rather than the zombies, and I agree.
  * Doris Finch! I hope Joon learns tree magic.

    >the exclusion was probably due to whichever method he uses for immortality, rather than the zombies

    Makes sense, the zombies aren't far off from what we've seen Fallatehr do. I don't see a meaningful ethical difference between subjecting yourself to torture because you have been altered to care about something so much you disregard your own pain, and just being locked in for it.

  Any speculation on why Amaryllis wants Joon to read the Bible? I think it will be related to her being kind of a Mary figure, but how exactly? The author hints that it might have something to do with the later books, any ideas what part could be relevant here?
  ```

  - u/i6i:
    ```
    Because it involves mortal races getting saved from hell by a chosen one placed in the world by its omnipotent creator of whom he is a counterpart. It's not hard to see the appeal and a lot of stuff in Aerb is influenced by it via cultural osmosis if by nothing else. Tolkien being the obvious example. 

    Also Amarylis religious views seem to be something akin to old testament jews who had to cope with the fact that the rulers of universe kept doing and demanding weird shit from them as some kind of test and meanwhile everything continued to be miserable until they could guess the correct password for everything to get fixed. Less adulation and more struggle with god.

      - u/Executioner404:
        ```
        Oh I said that as a joke, but the gist of it is pretty much my main theory for what Aerb is.

        Juniper died on Earth, likely through suicide, feeling only despair and hatred for whatever supposed God his universe has. Aerb is his afterlife - or perhaps the journey to it - based on his ideals, his sensibilities and his past.

        And if that is correct, the Dungeon Master isn't even necessarily God himself. He's an extension of what Aerb is, materialized from Juniper's feelings about what his callous God is like and his experiences in life as a DM (that eventually became callous to his players with Fel Seed).

        Whether there's an actual religious spin on it or if it's all due to Juniper's own beliefs on religion is up for debate.

    The thing is, it's all worded in such a way that there are no certainties and there's little guidance towards how to actually use it or abuse it. "You can sweet talk the Layman" sounds good, but what exactly it means isn't entirely clear. The wording makes me think it'll never be a sure bet, though. Likewise, "the map **might** become confused with the territory," with no indication of how you'd make that more likely to happen or what it'd actually look like in practice. 

    You're not wrong that it's powerful, but it's not the kind of powerful that you can really abuse because it's all so fuzzy and vague and open to interpretation, which is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from the locus. I suspect if you tried to actively explore its limits and find a way to munchkin it, you'd just get a flat "no" in a response.

    - u/CoronaPollentia:

    It's the gamebreaking virtue for sure, but I don't think its *true* intent and purpose is martial in nature. Confusion of the map and territory is singularly relevant to Joon's existential crisis, and sweet talking the Layman is practically deus ex machina. Also the sweet talking makes me think the name of the virtue is a pun on a second or third level...
    ```

      - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
        ```
        Sweet talk the Layman -> "the Layman" is a construction used to decide on interactions between magics. He gets asked simple questions like, "is that a chair?" to decide whether a magic item that makes chairs bigger will work on something.

        Otherwise, Reimer would ask, "what's a chair, anyway?", Joon might answer "it has 4 legs and you sit on it" then Reimer would sit on a deer and call it a chair. If you can sweet talk the Layman, you can make an argument why your thing should work, even if it really shouldn't

        Map and territory is a LessWrong meme, and I think it's been mentioned before in-story too https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Mistaking_the_map_for_the_territory

        Tldr maps oversimplify and necessarily skip information that might be important. If you can confuse them, then you can take any of the simplifications in the game layer and treat them as though they're the final word. My mind goes to HP and magical healing -- bone magic makes HP go up, but it's been established that it doesn't help with brain damage. If you forget "territory" details like that and use the simple map of HP, maybe now it will fix your brain

          The map-territory relation thing pre-dates LessWrong by about eighty years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation

          The single best example of the map not being the territory is 	René Magritte's painting "The Treachery of Images", which is a painting of a pipe with "Ceci n'est pas une pipe" (This is not a pipe) written below it. The map, after all, is not the territory.

        Two quotes from story:

        > According to the notes that Reimer had given, the Layman was more of a concept than a person, one which could be ‘instantiated’ in different ways, either through DM fiat, through agreement by the players, or by asking a third party who had no or little stake in the outcome. What that would mean on a system implemented in full with more rules, on what was probably a simulation was anyone’s guess. 

        In a D&D context, sweet talking the Layman is convincing everyone at the table (the DM especially) that things should work the way you want.

        > “Oh,” I replied. “You mean, why not make it more sensible and change it so that it would mirror reality?” She nodded. “It’s a map and territory thing,” I said. “You’ve got the map, which is a description of reality with baked-in assumptions about that reality, simplifications and shorthands and whatever, and then you have the territory, which is the actual reality itself. So in tabletop games, you have the rules, which are a playable map, and it’s totally disconnected from reality, so you start to get it into your head that those numbers are the thing you’re talking about, not a representation of them. And from there, you get into the business of number manipulation, rather than trying to simulate reality, in part because fuck reality, reality is boring and lame.”

        Joon explains it in terms of tabletop rules, but in the bigger picture, the map is the game (representation of reality); the territory is "reality".

  Does Grak have a beard? Because I've always pictured him as being pretty stereotypically dwarfy, which means having a big, bushy, braided beard. If that's accurate, then it definitely impacts the conversations he sometimes has about gender, considering how much of a masculine image that presents.

  Actually, that raises another point. How much of the traditions and aesthetics of Aerb's dwarves come from their decision to use masculine pronouns in Anglish? If they'd decided to use female or gender-neutral pronouns instead, would beards be less prevalent among dwarves?
  ```

    Yes, he has a braided and iirc dyed beard. He goes by Leadbraids in reference to it.

    I felt a twinge if foreshadowing when he mentioned how soul magic exclusions happened granularly in that chapter, together with the repeated allusions to the second empire.

            ~~IIRC we don't know in what way they became manifest (likely a hivemind, rather than exact clones like Doris?) and how instantaneous it was, but there's some connections to draw here - especially if the 'puppet' we just witnessed actually was directly controlled by Blue.~~

              > Manifest Destiny - The fall of the Second Empire was, by some accountings, inevitable, but by others, it was the work of a single incident. The exact nature of the magic that allows the immortal man named Manifest to puppet his subjects from a distance is unknown, as is his exact location, but it is clear that with the magic excluded, his range is limited to only Lankwon, once the Imperial City, now the City Made Manifest. Defeating him will be an impossible task, but one that you have taken upon yourself.

              The magic Manifest uses is unknown, he puppets other people rather than actually turning them into himself, and he seems to be a single person rather than a hivemind. If he was turning other people into himself, his location would be obvious if somewhat inconsequential.

                Oh. I thought the "City Made Manifest" was implicit confirmation that they are all being puppetered *at the same time*, hence everyone being Manifest as a hivemind of sorts. Too much speculation and misunderstanding on my part though.       
                I do recall someone mentioning him in relation to Soul magic exclusions, but maybe that was a theory in-universe rather than a confirmation.

                  Grand names seem pretty common on Aerb, and I wouldn't personally assign too much accuracy to them. IIRC AW had a post a long time ago about what munchkinry you could do with the ability to puppet half of the population in a fairly large area at any one time, which I think was him thinking about Manifest, but other than that we don't have much confirmed information about what Manifest actually does.

                  Manifest effectively destroyed the Guild of the Essential Soul when he manifested, since he controlled the people there, and him being a soul mage makes the most sense of the magics we've seen, but yeah that's only speculation.

    I'm kinda sad that it's looking like we'll never actually meet Aerb Tiffany, given what June said in his letter, but it makes narrative sense. Any interaction with her loses a lot of bite when 1) he's already dealt heavily with Bethel while she was wearing Tiff's face and 2) he's married to Amaryllis. If she was going to become a character in the story, it would have happened before he already worked through a lot of the issues she presents.

      I think there's still a decent chance we will. The quest text he got in chapter 143 clearly stated he would:

      Quest text predictions have always proved correct in the past to my knowledge (for instance the quest to save Amaryllis from Aumann correctly predicted he would get a kiss at the end), though maybe it only applies if he chooses to do the quest, and this is one he's been trying to avoid.

        It's especially insidious because collecting entad rings is just sensible. For most other entads, like gloves, armor, helmets, even swords and guns to an extent, you can only use one at a time. With the weapons you might be able to switch them out mid combat, but you're not actually going to use two at once. With rings, you can easily use 8 at once at a minimum provided they aren't excessively bulky. We see here that Joon has 4 rings on.

  > “The least rigidly defined are the most susceptible,” said Grak. “Reimer said that defining the letter A as B took five degrees of reasonableness.” I tried to think about what six or seven degrees would look like, and instantly understood: defining A as 1 would be six, and defining A as banana would be seven.

  Putting on my contrarian hat, I think defining A as 1 is far more reasonable than defining A as B.

  Consider the case of three boxes, labelled A, B and C. In this case its very easy to argue that these letters are a number system - first, second, third - 1, 2, 3. A = 1, B=2, C=3. 

  On the other hand, I'm finding it had to think of any case where A=B.

    I felt the same way about A as 1 at first, but I think it was meant to be a metaphor, and that Degrees of Reasonableness are all about **≈** rather than =. 

    * "A" and "B" are on the same scale, and very close together. An Entad working only on A wouldn't need too much adjustment to work on B.           
    * "A" and "1" only have a symbolic relationship, but are more separate as concepts.

    Defining A as B is a single increment in a base-26 system.

    The metaphor does start to break down a bit since you could argue that mathematicians switch between base systems all the time, but the gist is valid. 2 degrees of reasonableness means switching between similar but noncompatible systems. Literally apples to oranges.

  The discussion of the psychology and ecology of the Hells was fascinating--although one line did stick out to me.  If there are the infernal 1%ers out there who have millions of souls that go largely unused...does that mean that there are a lot of souls not actively being tortured?  Just...sort of held in limbo waiting until their billionaire demon overlord decides that he wants to torture them in particular?

  After the seemingly unending spectacle we had in the last couple of chapters this was some very welcome change of pace.   


  However I'm anxious that we'll get another gut punch soon since things are just going too well - new powers for the group left and right, near unlimited resources, no main character deaths aside from Pallida-ish.   


  As much as I'd like to get all the answers regarding Fel Seed, Uther etc. I also don't want this story to end anytime soon, I really hope that there still is a lot to come, even though a lot of threads are coming together atm. So many interesting exclusions which we'll likely never see (especially the boy in the time loop and the uber-farmer sound fascinating to me), a shame really.   


  Also getting those time lines was great, I'm on another reread right now it's not that easy to keep the timeline straight in your head.  


  Reimer and Lisi were hilarious, as was Amarylis response letter.   


  The marriage inspection prep. while well written and impactful didn't really land with me - sure keep the relationship drama going but we've been through how they felt for each other a few times now and I couldn't really take it too seriously esp. with all the Anime references.  


  Moving on, I'm just impressed how good of a character Grak is and how warped my view was due to the format of this being Junipers story. While not caring for him much in the beginning (as our Protagonist) in my reread I notice how much interesting stuff there was way from the beginning.  


  The Captain was another Highlight and I wonder what tricks he has up his sleeves given that he doesn't seem that powerful right now - for a moment I was even wondering if they'd mirror one of Joons earlier campaigns and just join sides with him (if only for a short time).  


  But the best part imo were Vals notes on the hells. I mean, they had been introduced as well, hell - but the more we learn the worse it gets. I mean...what the fuck, how many layers of shit do they have? While reading those I had miniature of Tony Benn in the back of my head with this speech [https://youtu.be/ETqOvBKnKdk?t=146](https://youtu.be/ETqOvBKnKdk?t=146) those poor poor infernals, also the notes tie in nicely with the Captain arc, economic systems based on suffering, creating a paradise for the very few while even a lot of the exploiters are just reinforcing their own misery. Quite poetic.   
  Still, kill them all.   


  Ah and one last thing. I really want to always read the chapters as soon as they come out, time zones be damned (they're released at 3am were I live), but yesterday I waited in vein.  
  Yeah, stupidity on my part for not just sleeping the night and reading them when they're released and I have time on hand, but it would still be great if the spreadsheets announcements were with the date.

      On the other hand, I'm 90% sure that with all of the absurd Virtues he had and Six-Eyed, he could use his bleeding stump as a pseudo-elbow and it'd still deal max damage on hit.

      ```
      One of the archaic meanings of "wise" is just "way", which used to get used in a lot of expressions, like "in every wise" or "in any wise". The phrase "in no wise" is now a fixed idiom, somewhat divorced from how the word "wise" has largely lost that meaning. It's most commonly found in older Bible translations, and still archaic, but used here for effect.

      ... but from the number of corrections I've gotten for that line, maybe it's more archaic than I thought, and just confusing if you don't know the fixed idiom.

If the game design were sensible, then this was probably a generalist/specialist trade-off, but in order to meet the immediate (and largely unknown) problems I was facing, a generalist approach was probably right.

      Same goes for MEN, which is mentioned later, I believe.

    Undefined healing magic available to really rich people who lead the country. Probably entads that get collected at hospitals, or maybe she had to ask some of her cousins to borrow entads.

    ```

    - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
      ```
      Soul backups (+ bone magic or other standard healing) solve anything, but you revert any growth you've had since the backup was taken, and I think Joon's Essentialism skill isn't high enough at his skill cap to do them - he has to sacrifice other skills. So it's an option of last resort

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        > Magic generally didn’t produce more magic, with a few exceptions. If you cut off a finger, it was really hard to find a magic that would regrow those bones (though it was relatively easy to heal a broken bone back together). If you lost blood, you needed a donor, or you needed to replenish it naturally on your own. Skin was a little more permissive than bone or blood, but it was apparently hard to find a magic that would help you recover from flaying. This was because bone, blood, and skin weren’t just physical things, they had latent magic.

        This is from chapter 101, though the skin thing obviously isn't true now. Grak went without a hand for his initial months in the time chamber because to actually grow missing bones back, even if the soul is fine, takes something beyond what Joon has available to him through bone, blood, and fairy healing. Maybe replacing a lost eye would have just taken a little bit of extra time that they didn't feel like spending, but the lost limbs needed something special.
        ```

      - u/Executioner404:

          How does this map onto the soulfuck mechanics, though? If Joon goes into the soul, and says here be humerus (where there is none), and then fairies are murdered, why doesn't this work?
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            Making new bones is excluded, which was mentioned when he first sacrificed points to get to Soul Magic 100. Separately, most healing magics, including all the ones they have directly available, can't make bones or even make bone matter where it's missing (Grak had a hole in his head from a void rifle, and the best they could do with bone magic is cover it with skin and restore the brain). If they tried what you're suggesting, I think at best the healing magic would move the flesh around so that there's a cavity where the bone would go.

            Druid magic is an exception to the above, because it's an exception to basically every rule, but it's inconsistent if it will do what you want.
            ```

          - u/Executioner404:
            ```
            It's just a limitation. Bone, blood and skin are latent magic, so they can't be created by *most* magic out of thin air.

            He has to move and alter an existing bone to put a humerus where he wants. I'm not sure there's an exact explanation for how lengthening bones works, maybe it makes them weaker temporarily.

    According to the timeline in the notes chapter, that happened in Halig 29, and the last batch ended on Jeima 8, which is apparently the following month. I’d reckon there’s 51 days left.

      I think it's an arbitrary time-limit for the sake of dick-swinging. It doesn't give much preparation time which means Joon is conveying submission to the dragon by doing it without preparing it fully even if he was going to do it anyway, and they know exactly when he's blown off the mission - if he's outside the exclusion zone after 2 months and Blue isn't dead, then they kill him.

  Halfway through getting the locus out of the bottle (!!) I was expecting the solution to be Kleining the bottle somehow--redefining its topology so that, at least from the locus's perspective, the inside was also the outside (why don't you put the whole world into a bottle, Superman?). Although that has terrifying implications, including "what if Bethel ate a Klein bottle?"

  &#x200B;

  It feels like that 20th point of loyalty was made contingent on the locus being tethered to the land, since there's some difficult-to-patch exploitability otherwise--for example, take the bottle to somewhere that's already an exclusion zone, and further munchkin the already-excluded magic. Find the bloodline magic exclusion zone, put Juniper and Amaryllis in the bottle, and come out with Arthur somehow.

    >The bursar himself was a fat man, which was unusual for one of the he’lesh. The Book of Blood went into great detail about their apparently prodigious members (thanks, Syfriend), but in terms of outward appearance, he had orange skin, three thick, mutually opposable fingers on each hand, and a way of walking that kept his long legs tucked in and his feet close to his butt. Standing tall didn’t come naturally to the he’lesh, which was probably a good thing, since he’d have been nine feet tall if he unfolded himself. After doing me the brief courtesy of opening the door and ushering me in, he did a little waddling walk so that he could sit behind his desk, on a cushion rather than a proper chair. I took the chair in front of the desk, adjusting it to human proportions, then watched his dark orange eyes look over a hookah that was sat on his desk. He pressed a lever, then took a hit from the hookah and looked at me.

    [...]

    >Uther had tangled with the he’lesh, who smoked their emotions. More specifically, the he’lesh kingdom had been overtaken by a novel herb that induced an altered state, one where they would see things that they would later forget. It was a shared delusion, a link between the smokers, which might not have been so bad, except that there were things within that shared delusion that had gone feral and could make some impact on the lives of the smokers. Uther had gone in and killed the hallucinatory beasts, then exterminated trade in the herb with extreme prejudice. It was notable in part because the bursar was he’lesh, but other than that, there weren’t many similarities.

    Is this a meme I'm not getting?

    Maybe that's actually Doris' excluded magic

  "It's not like I like you or anything"

  Holy crap, I'm not even done with the chapter yet, but I just had to comment that this line had me on the floor. The one person who could say that with plausible deniability. What a callback.

  When did they drop flower magic from Juniper's build?  I mean, it makes sense, but I'm curious when it happened and what they subbed in instead
  ```

    ```
    He still had it in Sound and Silence. It's explicitly not listed in [Respec,](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/50446706) so that's when it was dropped.
    ```

  - u/UPBOAT_FORTRESS_2:
    ```
    Probably in the last big Respec (in the chapter of the same name)

  ```
  You know what I just realized? 
  Despite this being my absolute favorite fictional series ever, I don't know what the protagonist looks like.

  Somehow, I read through 200 chapters without forming a mental image of Joon.

  Is there any part in the story where his appearance is actually described? Cause if so, I sure forgot about it.

    Chapter 2:

    >(I won’t belabor my physical description. My friend Greg had once said that I looked like someone had chosen ‘default’ for every option in the character creator, which I’d tried to laugh at but cut kind of deep. I wasn’t handsome, I wasn’t ugly, none of my features were very prominent, my eyes were blue, my hair was brown, average build, average height … After Greg had made his comment at one of our D&D games, my nickname had been ‘default’ for a while, at least until I stopped pretending to find it funny, and even after that my friends would use similar lines to trash talk me, saying that I was “the most generic man alive”, “a white bread with skim milk $@#$!$#!”, or “the human equivalent of vanilla ice cream”. Not that I was any less of an asshole to them.)

    There's also been bits and pieces when his physical appearance changes on level up.
    ```

  - u/MugaSofer:
    ```
    Generic protagonist. Brown hair & eyes, caucasian, now fairly tall and fit due to leveling physical stats. 

    He mentions early on feeling hurt when his friends joked that he has the look you get by leaving all the appearance settings to default in a video game.
    ```

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  >Two were human, but the other two were undead, their skin off-colored, more pink than it should have been

  Am I to assume they're white or can you not tell dark skinned zombies apart? There are different human ethnicities in this world right?
  ```

- u/NamelessCommander:
  ```
  How did no one mention this gem of a line yet? 

  *“You have a condition you’re going to give me, so that I can keep giving you blowjobs?”*

  This witty and warm facet of Mary is so endearing.
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  In this batch we learned a bit about the Mary clones. A few of the details are a bit of a major dealbreaker,  or really should be.

  * They follow  a law of least utility or benefit when deciding between being a human or animated statue for the purpose of interaction with abilities 

  * they have no souls.

  * their combat stats are so low they can be expected to fail most encounters. 

  * They know everything  0!Mary knows and vice versa, at a temporal resolution of 1 day.

  So they're effectively ex anima for the purpose of resisting demonic/devilish posession, and have information that would cause the hells to starting invading (the existence and location of Valencia,  as well as the details  of her power).  The moment a devil rolls a Mary clone for a posession attempt, the hells will attck any wek points they know about.
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    I think "effectively" doesn't actually match reality here. Rosemallow's entad did the same thing and they don't seem to have had any problems with possession.
    ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      1, we don't know that. 

      2, Rosemallow never took her clones out of the warded room.  Mary is letting them roam outside.
      ```
