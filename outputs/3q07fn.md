## Editing is evil. Yes, I said evil.

### Post:

The first half of Set In Stone was written when I didn't have any sort of formal understanding of plot and structure.  And I definitely didn't understand intensity or flow.  Trying to cut out the fat and not change the story too much, while maintaining the world building and the character development is painful.

That said, I've finished another chapter of Set In Stone at my [beta reading blog](https://betareadersite.wordpress.com/2015/10/24/chapter-2/) if anyone wants to see how the finished product is developing.  The next chapter (not this one) is completely new content, a full-chapter flashback, and mostly completed.

When the book is published, all this content will go away.

    Am I missing something?  I'm not sure what the comment is supposed to express.

  Speaking of editing, I wonder why do you spend time in the early chapters talking about Allen's unusual metabolism? Unless it's meant to be a Chekov's gun for later books I think it could be one of the parts that you can cut out without too much trouble if you're looking to lower the word count. I haven't read the beta chapters yet so I don't know if you've reached that point yet or even already cut it out.

  In addition, why are you writing an entirely new chapter if it's not going to even appear in the final version?

  EDIT: Or did you mean that this will be our only chance to read the chapter for free?
