  Just started reading this, it's been very interesting so far!

  After reading [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) and getting a terrifyingly good impression of just how much you can do with a relatively simple superpower, this story feels extremely promising.

  I really like the world you've created, will be interesting to see how set can improve. I'm excited to see where this goes, keep up the good work!

  Just finished reading the 7 chapters, and I gotta say, I love it! It pushes all the right buttons for me. I'll definitely add it to my tracking list.
