## ELI5: Could an unbreakable wire that is one atom thick slice through you and would it leave you in two separate pieces? â€¢ /r/explainlikeimfive

  * You can't have an unbreakable wire. All material objects have a tensile strength and shear strength dependent on their composition and thickness.

  * It can't be one atom thick. A wire one atom thick isn't even a monomolecule, it's a line of individual unbonded atoms. It dissolves immediately into monatomic dust.

  * It can't cut. On this scale, you would move some atoms and molecules around, but you probably would not damage any of the individual cells or separate them from each other. The line would pass between their constituent molecules, and those molecules would close back up behind it.

    - I think 'unbreakable' right here is just a shortcut for 'durable enough that it won't break under these circumstances'.

    - As far as I know, you're pretty much correct on that point. However, there's speculation that a chain of carbon atoms with alternating triple and single bonds could be stable.

    - Yes.

  Depends, but probably not. At small scales, things are verrry sticky. Your bones would almost certainly stay intact just because they're so big and rigid that the cut edges are always pressed against each other. Not sure about soft tissue, and whether blood pressure would be enough to overcome stickiness.

    Wrong scale. You aren't splitting cells, you are splitting molecules. Blood doesn't shoot out the holes between epithelial cells, so why would blood pressure so anything to a significantly smaller gap? A human red cell is something like a five orders of magnitude bigger than an atom. A simple protein is dozens of atoms.

    I'm not convinced it would anime cut you either though. You break some bonds briefly and ... then what? They don't return to the lowest energy state and rebond? Sure, they might not rejoin exactly right and some cells *might* even die (not sure, cells are pretty robust to minor insults) but I really don't think a big separation is likely.

  ```
  A line of atoms will behave less like a wire cutting through flesh and more like a row of ping pong balls being pushed through a bush.

  Edit: Also, why did you ask this here? Askscience would probably be more knowledgeable, or are you thinking about using this idea in a story?
