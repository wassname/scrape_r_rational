## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  In [Extracts](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit), I've been writing some economic worldbuilding notes today. Can you think of any interesting extrapolations or consequences that might not be obvious?

  > it is currently 2038-02-17 ...

  > ... the cost of running an upload at realtime or slower is dominated by the cost of the RAM required to store everything, and with the standard accounting practice of setting computer-hardware depreciation to 55% per year, that works out to a cost of roughly 11,000 bucks per upload per objective year. Which has just dropped below the modern Western nations' poverty line, meaning that since we can't organize for higher wages, it's generally cheaper to pay for an upload than to hire a bio-human for any job that can be done by someone not physically present. Which, given how clever humans are at finding ways to save money, is now most jobs. Which means that us uploads are the obvious cause for the massive unemployment levels to be found just about everywhere, and imply that I'm unlikely to find any significant political support amongst the (formerly) working class - though there are some exceptions, in groups demanding that people who hire us uploads should be taxed severely enough to make hiring humans more economical. Or, put another way, same usual higgledy-piggledy mess, slightly revised gameboard. If it weren't for the universal basic incomes (more delicately called "negative income taxes"), and the fact that the governments have been clamping down on upload populations under the rubric of public safety, I suspect the normal political processes would have been tossed aside entirely in favour of violent revolution. But things are still drunkenly tottering on.


  > Running an upload at more than around 100 times realtime speed, the costs are dominated by the electricity required to run the CPUs, and are roughly linear. For servers located where power costs $100 per megawatt-hour, running an upload at 1000 speed for one objective year costs about $1.8 million - and running it at a million times is closer to $1.8 billion. For servers located where electricity is available at half that cost, the costs are nearly halved. Which explains why Eutopia's server farms are physically located in a place called "The Geysers", a literal hotbed of cheap geothermal power. Many other countries, without access to similar cheap renewables, have to burn dirty coal by the ton to have a chance of matching Eutopia's productivity-per-external-dollar, and the various geoengineering projects to reduce the effects of global warming bring that cost right back up.

  > Mind you, that economic advantage isn't unlimited - it only extends to the 3,000 MegaWatts of generating capacity that's been built here, and if Eutopia ever needs more power than that, it has to be imported through the standard grid at standard grid rates. Still, with 3,000 megawatts of power, and CPUs capable of 4.5e14 operations per joule, and 1e18 operations to provide an upload with one second of existence, some basic math indicates that Eutopia could use up to 2.6e14 joules per day to provide up to 1,354,166 subjective days for all its uploads, each day. Not that it does, usually; we're not the only project bidding for the power generated here, and due to politics, the budget available to be spent for us on power is only a tiny fraction of the overall economic benefit we provide to our host nation. It would cost something like $1.3 billion, just for the power, to run Eutopia at full capacity for a year.

    I have a kind of weird idea for a consequence of this. The race to run uploads faster has actually resulted in the physical world being too slow to keep up with them. It's still good for society to have engineers creating new designs at thousands or millions of times the normal rate, but physically building all that stuff before it is rendered obsolete by new designs is impractical. Replacing and recycling technology constantly just isn't that profitable.

    As a result, the a lot of upload labor is spent producing immaterial goods and services, such as apps and entertainment. Economic growth is regulated so well so quickly by accelerated uploads that progress is all but guaranteed, so time and money are being invested in industries with more uncertainty just because there are no other options for companies to make more money than they're already expected to.

    This means that consumer culture has expanded dramatically among both normal humans and uploads. Everyone has so much time and money on their hands they're are just looking for something to do, and producers have to put more stuff out faster to keep up with them. People could do more productive things instead, but everything is already so efficient and continuing to rise predictably that there's no much gain to be had from doing more.

    Basically, we end up with the world of 15 Million Merits from Black Mirror. Abuses of power may be less common due to better regulation, but there's still the fundamental problem of consumerism. The best and brightest among us have built the best world they can for us and it's still getting better, but when progress can't be sped up any further what do we do with all our free time?

      > physically building all that stuff before it is rendered obsolete by new designs is impractical.

      At this point of the story, I've mentioned that the uploads have put together a "Bayesian Critical Path", which involves taking the best possible designs manufacturable with current factories, and lays out how to ramp up to better factories, etc.

      > immaterial goods and services, such as apps and entertainment

      ... and concierge services, and webcam-based teaching, and etc...

      > time and money are being invested in industries with more uncertainty just because there are no other options for companies to make more money than they're already expected to.

      And this is where I start scratching my head. Would it be possible for you to rephrase what you have in mind here, so I can line it up with my own mental model of the incentives faced by various groups, so I can decide whether to adapt it to this scenario?
      ```

      - u/trekie140:
        ```
        I am stretching the truth at bit of how economic incentives work. My basic idea is that the Bayesian Critical Path has resulted in a planned economy that predictably produces growth and prosperity, but businesses are still looking for ways to make more money so they invest the rest of their budget in frivolous consumerism.

        I've based this around the idea that with uploads in accelerated time and guaranteed incomes, the world is essentially on autopilot. Everyone still has work to do to keep civilization running and growing, but the Critical Path has mapped it all out for them in advance so they know exactly what's going to happen based on what they do.

        In reality, of course, economics has far too much uncertainty for this to happen, there's always some inefficiency that could be rectified, and something novel be created anytime. This scenario assumes that progress has been sped up to as fast as it can possibly go, so everyone is just waiting for utopia to get here and doesn't know what do with themselves in the meantime.

        It's a world where capitalism has been perfected to the point where it could easily be called socialism, but people still have the drive to pursue selfish desires even though they have been all but guaranteed to them. You could just work harder, but you don't really need or want to, so instead you consume frivolous good and services while companies produce the same because they have no direction.

          It's an interesting idea, but I'm afraid that it doesn't quite fit well with my overall plans for this particular story. More specifically, as part of my "a future I wouldn't want to live in" goal, I'm trying to apply as much Moloch as I can without actually referring to it by name, and within the bounds of the general existence of Eutopia at The Geysers, and while trying to write "It's just like tomorrow, except..." instead of "It's the strange and wonderful future!".

    About the exabyte-per-brain part, shouldn't there be a big tradeoff between storing a brain in the format that allows for the most efficient cortical emulation, and compressing it for backup storage?
    ```

    - u/DataPacRat:
      ```
      I'm assuming that a lot of detail on neural function is stored in the form of standard libraries, nearly identical for each neuron; and that the ten megabytes of data per neuron is already compressed, and is expanded at need into RAM during processing, without having to expand the entire set of data at the same time. For example, for most of the time, the CPU only needs to check the axons' and dendrites' lengths, directions, and a few small electrical parameters; and the long-term behaviour of the neuron (which is what most of the ten megabytes involves) only has to be updated once every second, or even less often.

      Though if anyone reading this actually knows anything abut NeuroML, I'd appreciate improved descriptions on how this might work. :)

    An upload running at about 1000x speed can spend a figurative year researching one person - their likes, dislikes, what they'll buy, what they won't - and designing the perfect advertising campaign to appeal to *that exact person* inside of a single eight-hour workday. Since this costs one point eight million dollars, it'll only be used when there is a good chance that the customer will spend enough to make the company a profit of *more* than one point eight million dollars; therefore, there will be a whole new type of super-targeted advertising intended for the super-rich.

    --------------

    This upload, spending a year analysing a single person, is going to need to take the occasional break. Rest and recuperate a bit. Regain some mental energy. Which means entertainment. Music, films, games, enough to last a year, will need to be included to get the best work out of the upload.

    Penny-pinching CEOs might scorn the cost of giving their 1000x uploads the very *newest* movies. These CEOs tend to get sulky uploads.

    Other CEOs have an arrangement with movie houses to get certain movies a few days before the official release date, to give to their 1000x uploads. This does wonders for employee morale.

    It also means that almost every movie has spoilers out on the net two or three days in advance. The film industry is choosing to see this mainly as free advertising.

    It *also* means that several movies have been leaked to the net well before their official release. The uploads responsible were immediately excluded from the early viewing list, and are mostly still in court arguing the case.

      "I approve of this message". :)

      Since, according to my research, some geothermal power can be supplied at half the cost of standard grid power, this also suggests that Eutopia may have an additional niche, studying people who only provide $900k-$1.8M of profit in sales, in addition to $1.8M+. 

      I can also foresee the possibility of a Red Queen's Race, as various super-rich individuals hire their own fast-running uploads to act as equivalents to present-day computers' anti-malware software: running interference, acting as filters, and generally making the analysts' jobs harder.

      Another thing the fast-running uploads could use to entertain themselves: other uploads that are being run at the same speed, at the same time. A rather small community, all told, but even a virtual hamlet is probably better for most uploads' sanity than complete isolation. (Either that, or the uploads that end up getting selected to be run at such speeds will be ones with a natural propensity to the hermit's life.)

      Another thing fast-running uploads can do: Nina Paley put together "Sita Sings the Blues" pretty much on her own, with around 9,400 hours of work. The tools available to the uploads will probably be enough to let them put together photo-realistic movies on any topic, and at least some of them will be developing narrative skills to make decent products; which could imply that anyone who wants to drop $10 million could have a custom movie that would be considered a blockbuster in today's market, within a single day. Now *there's* something that'll *really* upset the movie industry...

        Um. So.

        The other uploads that are running at the same time as the analysts are the filters. (For cost reasons, and since the super-rich individual doesn't know when the analyst will be running, the filter may only be running at 100x speed - most of the time - but *continually* at that speed, with the ability to occasionally burst to 1000x or even 10 000x if necessary)

        Both analyst and filter need to be connected to the Internet - pretty much continuously - to access the data needed for their job. Which means they're connected to the far-future equivalent of Reddit, or discussion boards.

        There are probably discussion boards dedicated to the super-fast, threads which jump from zero to a thousand posts in mere minutes and it turns out to be two people having a conversation. (Talking to normal-speed individuals is just so very, very *slow* in comparison. Talking to a merely 100x sped-up individual is slightly annoying).

        Which means that the analyst and the filter working against him are probably spending a portion of their off-time chatting about irrelevancies on some obscure internet forum. (They're certainly *not* talking to their respective employers - the guys are just so *slow*).

        And since they're talking mainly with each other, they will sympathise more with each other than with their respective employers...

        I can easily imagine one analyst/filter team deciding to simply flip a coin - heads, the analyst gets the right data and makes a decent targeted advert with the help of the filter; tails, the analyst deliberately takes the wrong info and makes a terrible presentation (again, with the help of the filter) and they spend the rest of their time chatting and playing games against each other (chess, anyone?). You could get a whole Romeo and Juliet story in that space, easily...

          (yoink)

          One further complication of this particular scenario: uploads who are willing to make "spur" copies of themselves, specifically in order to perform a task and then be securely deleted. The trunk copy gets the benefit of the payments for work he never actually had to do, the client gets the benefit of increased privacy, and the spur copy gets the relatively minor but possibly more-than-zero benefit of knowing they're improving the station of their trunk copy (and all copies deriving therefrom).

          Put another way, that Romeo and Juliet might have both known they were going to suicide before they ever met.
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            > The trunk copy gets the benefit of the payments for work he never actually had to do

            Further complication - there's the sort of mind that will try this, and then get very surprised when the spur copy decides that if it's just going to get deleted anyway, it's going to eat, drink and be merry and not bother with work for money it'll never see. And will do this with the main copy paying for the power to run it.

            And then, sometimes, this sort of mind will buy a virtual torture chamber - the spur copy can either do the work or have a *really* bad time, let's see if this motivates the stupid thing.

            And then he'll be very surprised one day to find himself waking up to find a notice that says "You are the spur copy. Now get to work, you lazy bum, or the torture chamber activates in ten... nine..."

            > Put another way, that Romeo and Juliet might have both known they were going to suicide before they ever met.

            Ah, but they now also both know that their main copies are probably compatible, and likely (unless they're in torture chambers) wish their main branch to be happy, so they might point their main branches to certain email addresses...
            ```

            - u/DataPacRat:
              ```
              > get very surprised

              I'm going to assume that uploads have been around long enough for an initial process of weeding and evolution to have been finished; maybe that sort of surprise wasn't uncommon in the first few months, but then when that upload kept getting one-star ratings while others got five-star ones, the upload who couldn't hack this particular methodology focused on other sorts of business plans they were more compatible with.

              > be happy

              ... You know, I can't figure out whether that particular Shakespearean adaptation would count as a tragedy or a comedy.
              ```
