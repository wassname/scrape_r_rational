  Heh, "Kardashian type-3 civilization."

  This is easily the most horrifying dystopian satire I've seen since *Brave New World*.

    Eh, it could be a lot worse.  Clearly other parts of the world are doing OK, and scientists can still be found...

  I'm not really a fan of how heavy-handed the story is. It reads as a caricature. And... the word "nerd" apparently bothers him? I mean, I see his point kind of, but I don't feel very persuaded by it. I mostly like Egan though, but I'm afraid the stories I like most are the least rational.

    It was the heavy-handedness that reminded me of this subreddit. I mean, you wouldn't describe HPMoR as "subtle" would you? \^\^

      On the Author Tract scale, HPMOR is right up there with Left Behind.

    It IS an insult, you know. That some of us use it on ourselves is just like all "reappropriations" of words. Call yourself a nerd all you like, but if you don't consider yourself one, please also don't use it to describe others either -- not unless you want to belittle them.

  From sidebar:

  >  The story is like a puzzle; readers can reach the same solution as the characters by using the information provided earlier in the story.

  The ultimate if a bit crude application of this principle, I stopped mid story and grabbed a piece of paper to work out the solution. And the final connection to higher dimension rotation is undoubtedly satisfying.
