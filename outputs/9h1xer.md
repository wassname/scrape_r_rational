  Frankly this is a pretty great outcome, putting yourself in the dwarves' power allows you to negotiate without them trying to burn you with lava. And since Catherine wants the drow and the dwarves want them gone, I'd say it's a reasonable trade.

    The drawback for the dwarves is that the Drow are still out there and alive, so could conceivably come back and attack them in the future.

      I don't think the drow are anything close to a match for the dwarfs. From their perspective, this entire mission is just expensive pest cleaning from a strategic location so that one of their real enemies (DK) can be contained. So if someone comes along and says "hey I'll take these pests off your hands" then I think they'd be totally fine with it.

      Assuming of course, *Akua's* theory is correct...

  Dwarves don't play.
