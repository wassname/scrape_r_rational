  Sweet.  I've been waiting *years* for this game.  Still no estimated release date though.

    Yeah, I kind of expect the game to just appear completed on Steam with no warning whatsoever.

    But I'm glad that Marc has never made any promises on the release date, so I can actually be sure that if he ever does post one, he will be very certain to release it on the given date.

  For those who may not know, [Miegakure](http://miegakure.com/) is an ongoing Work In Progress to build a puzzle game where you move through 4 dimensions. It's been in development since 2009, but it looks like its release may be arriving soon!

  Ah yes, *Miegakure*.... Looking real cool, but...

  At this point I might as well be taking bets as to weather or not it will come out before Half Life 3.
  ```

    I'll take that bet. Miegakure getting outside funding means that Marc has some outside forces to account to, to actually release it sooner or later and he has completed multiple levels/worlds of the game. While Vale on the other hand is notorious for constantly delaying releases.

    So I'd be willing to take a low-value bet that Miegakure will release before Half Life 3.

    Them releasing by 2018 (Half Life's current expected release)? That's a different bet!

      Wait, Half-Life 3 has an expected release date now? I figured that I'd have to revived from cryogenic suspension before I could see Half-Life 3.
      ```

        Well....I don't know about an [*official* release date](http://www.ibtimes.co.in/half-life-3-release-date-planned-q4-2017-q1-2018-game-not-active-development-says-former-643323)....
