## [FF][RT] "Marked for Death", a rational Naruto quest -- join in!

### Post:

/u/Velorien, /u/FuguOfAnotherWorld, /u/AugSphere and I have been running a Naruto quest for the last couple weeks.  For those who (like me) aren't familiar with the term:  in this case "quest" means "play-by-post RPG where all players vote to control the actions of a single player character".

The premise is that you are part of a large group of missing-nin from Mist.  You were sent out on a strike mission against an enemy nation; partway there, one of the senior jonin discovered documents in the commander's tent showing that you were being sent to your death on a suicide mission.  The ensuing battle killed most of your force; the survivors fled, taking up refuge in a hellhole of a swamp on the border between Fire and Grass and are struggling to survive against everything the world can throw at you.

There are a fair number of differences from canon; for one, the world is a lot harsher and we've changed a bunch of the backstory.  It's also a rational story, so people don't behave as ridiculously as they do in canon.  (That right there was one of the biggest reasons the backstory changed so much.)

The story updates every Thursday (Velorien) and Sunday (me).  Drop by and join in!

  Lighting Up the Dark guy and Team Anko guy writing on same thing. 

  Okay then reading time is now, now is the time of reading. 
  But will this interfere with LUD and TA, and how do you two write together? Is it turn based or do you send drafts to each other until you both agree on a chapter?

    We take it in turns.  I write on Sundays, /u/Velorien writes on Thursdays.  We coordinate via Hipchat, and each of us generally throws the other a plot hook at least once per update.  /u/FuguOfAnotherWorld (who posts in the quest as Jackercracks) helps with worldbuilding and /u/AugSphere does that and game mechanics.

  I would really appreciate a story-only thread on ff.net - it's way easier to scrape to epub or similar.

    Feel free to copy-paste it over.  Just please keep the references to the original authors.
