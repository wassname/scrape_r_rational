## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  1. What are your New Year's Resolutions? Mine are, basically, exercising more, reading more, and writing more, though all of those things are broken up into sub-resolutions (e.g. I decided my word count goal by looking at the projects that I need/want to accomplish this year, estimated the word count per project based on past projects, and then broke that into monthly/weekly/daily counts + some buffer/failure days to make sure that the goal was reasonable). I'm also moving residences, in part so that I live closer to a gym. 

  2. Anyone want to form an /r/rational group to support each other in keeping our resolutions, to the extent that online acquaintances can do so? I have some ideas, but I’m less set on the “how” and am open to ditching or adding to them. Register interest *first*, and then we can figure out what would work for the people who are interested. This might not be very effective, but I’m all about trying new things (especially low-cost things) and I’m willing to give it the old college try if anyone else is.

    I recommend you make this a post rather than a comment, because the Monday Thread is for discussion but you are trying to get a mini-group together for mutual support rather than asking for advice on how to keep up with New Year's Resolutions.

    Not to say that you shouldn't have posted here (it's fine!), but it likely work better as a post over as a comment.

      I’d rather not make this it’s own post, since this is still primarily a fiction subreddit, but I’ll move this to the off-topic thread if someone thinks that it isn’t appropriate for Monday.

        And here I was waiting for it to appear on the main page.

        I'll be interested, one way or another.

  For blood pressure reasons I'm looking for a precise saltshaker or other way of applying salt to food. Most saltshakers either flow too fast and are hard to control or flow too slowly and clog easily. It seems the only way to find out which is the case is to try it yourself which isn't an option at any store I know of.

  Any recs?

    Could you use a small spoon(e.g. a teaspoon) and a small bowl of salt?

    I put the salt in the pepper shaker and vice versa. Typically pepper shakers have fewer holes; because what I really want is tonnes of pepper and a precise amount of salt, it's all result and no hassle apart from my guests being confused every once in a while.

    Try using a [salt grinder](https://www.amazon.com/Salt-Grinder/s?ie=UTF8&page=1&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3ASalt%20Grinder).

    If you're desperate, you could resort to eating liquid-type foods, like soups and porridges. Dissolve salt in water, do math, pour a very precise amount of the salt water into a measuring container, then pour the salt water from the container onto your liquid-type food.
    ```

    ```
    Salt shakers tend to acquire a salt crust that eventually makes the holes smaller. You could try to accelerate that - dipping the shaker in water and then in salt, or if you want to go fancy, putting the shaker headfirst into a supersaturated salt solution and then slowly evaporte it over a heater. 

    Also buy all the shakers online, test them to your satisfaction and return the ones you dont like.

    ```
    Put salt in a bowl and pinch what you want.
    Simple and effective.
    ```
