## Worth the Candle: Identity of the DM

### Post:

(Spoilers for all chapters up to 221)

I think it's likely that Arthur's older brother is the DM running Aerb. There are only a few pieces of evidence but these first two are fairly strong:

- In [Chapter 144](https://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-144/), Reimer's notes describing the game system that runs Aerb (and which Aerb!Juniper supposedly created) say:

>Should probably mention that a lot of this system wasn’t unique, it was descended from a game called Fullplate that focused more on wargaming instead of adventures/theater. Your innovation was hacking on a whole bunch of garbage and including some talky bits, though at least some of the work was done by Arthur’s brother, not sure how much.

That is, Arthur's brother did some unknown amount of work in building the rules of the game that runs Aerb.

- The DM of Aerb indicated to Juniper that they're kindred spirits in their talk in [Chapter 79](https://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-79/):

>“Do I know you?” I asked.

>“We’re kindred spirits, you and I,” he replied.

This is an evasive answer, which to me suggests the answer is not exactly "no" (and we wouldn't expect, narratively, for the DM to be some completely new character).

Taking this answer on its face, the main defining feature of Juniper is his worldbuilding and acting as a DM. And Arthur's brother is the only other (likely) DM mentioned in the story; as mentioned early on in [Chapter 4](http://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-4/):

>The Collection actually predated the group; when Arthur’s brother had gone off to college, he’d left Arthur with two dozen source books for various tabletop RPG systems, though about half of them were for D&D.

- Arthur's brother would care, at least a little, about Arthur. At least, we don't think he actively hates Arthur, from [Chapter 96](https://alexanderwales.com/worth-the-candle-ch-96/):

>Arthur’s brother was nine years older than him, and I was never quite sure which of them was the mistake, if either was. It seemed like a long gap between children, enough that in a lot of ways, Arthur was effectively an only child. Arthur’s father was an engineer, and his mother worked part-time at a store that sold wool, which she did mostly to fill her days, since it wasn’t like they needed the money. He didn’t talk about his family that much, except to say that his brother was fairly distant and his mother was on medication for depression and anxiety. Arthur’s father was an old-school geek, with a small library of fantasy and science fiction, but most of it was ancient and yellowed — and, honestly, kind of trash, the pulpy kind of stuff that had mostly gone out of fashion.

Perhaps (wildly speculating) Aerb was created for Arthur by his brother, with the idea of actually including Juniper only coming later.

---------------------------------------

These were all the mentions of Arthur's brother that I could find, maybe there's more.

Given these, I think Arthur's brother is the best candidate for the identity of the DM, possibly tied with "The DM is someone completely new and unknown" and "The DM is Juniper himself, somehow"

  What would be the point of this reveal?  Why would it matter? It's a character we know nothing about, and don't care about. It explains nothing about the nature of the game or reality, it doesn't answer "why" any of this.  A reveal like that would be total anticlimax with no narrative purpose.
  ```

- u/OldManEnglish:
  ```
  I'm a fan of the theory that the DM is Joon, but not the same as the character in the story.

  The idea being that the the DM is the real Joon, older irl, and that he had created this simulation. He initially put Arthur in due to never getting over his death. Putting Joon MK2 in is another attempt to deal with something he never got over. His teenage trauma and attempted suicide. Joon in the story is his attempt at creating an alternative past for himself, including changes to the character itself, to be more the person he wished he had been.

  - u/swagrabbit:
    ```
    I suppose it would be the most 'metanarrative' option of all to have the ending be the worst and most clichéd ending in all of fiction ("it was all a dream").
    ```

- u/catern:
  ```
  Two more weak points in favor of this theory:

  - Arthur's brother has been mentioned less than we'd expect for someone interested in/involved in/knowledgeable about RPGs. Sure, Arthur doesn't talk about his family, and sure, Arthur's brother is away at college, but Arthur's brother must have been very engaged with RPGs to have this large collection of source books. Surely Arthur would talk to his brother about RPGs at some point - it's apparently a strong shared interest. Heck, Arthur's brother might even visit home at some point - participating in a session would be plausible. Aerb!Juniper apparently even collaborated to some extent (perhaps without actual interaction) with Arthur's brother on the ruleset of the game running Aerb, and Aerb!Juniper's life is supposed to be pretty close to Earth!Juniper's. Yet we have had very little mention of Arthur's brother, none of these light, simple interactions that one might expect with the minor character who started Juniper and all his Earth friends on the path of RPGs.

  - This would be an unexpected resolution of the "Who created/runs Aerb?" question. "It's just Juniper from the future" is the obvious resolution, and frankly, a pretty boring answer in itself, both of which are points against it. Arthur's brother would be a more interesting subversion. (Of course, the obvious answer is also sometimes just the answer...)

  ```
  DM is obviously Arthur. DM during Arthur's time in Aerb is long gone. Arthur took the reins and prepped the hex for Joon's arrival.
  ```

  - u/Tenoke:
    ```
    I do like that theory a bit as it explains why the rules are different and ties somewhat with Arthur's changes. But then.. who was Arthur's DM and why was he picked?
    ```

- u/thecommexokid:
  ```
  I think your list of alternate theories is missing an important possibility: The identity of the DM is not important to the story Alexander Wales wants to tell and won't be resolved in any meaningful way within the text.
  ```

- u/HundredBears:
  ```
  I'm confused why "the DM is the author" isn't on your list. It works even better with the "kindred spirits" line, explains why he has the power that he has and fits the metafictional nature of the story. Ever since Juniper started speculating about how he might be emulated in precisely the same way that the people of Aerb could be emulated (and he's right of course, they're all characters in the same story), that was my best guess.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    "In story" the "author" of WtC is Joon himself, writing about his adventures after the fact. Considering that, it would be pretty disappointing if the DM was revealed to have "been me all along, renowned ratfic writer Alexander Wales!"
    ```

    - u/HundredBears:
      ```
      I'd find it a little disappointing myself, nor does it fit perfectly with all the evidence that we have (for instance, setting up the Lena Cordrew/Karen Dowler anagram wouldn't have been that much of a pain for him). Alexander Wales has the ability to be the DM and might easily have the inclination, though. For it to be Joon, Arthur's brother, or some as yet unknown character leaves us with the question of how and why they'd choose to be the DM, and it's hard to imagine a satisfying answer.
      ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      I’m okay with it. The Crimson King did it, it worked. It would be a reference to that trope and the whole story is trope soup in the first place. Alexander Wales can do that too, if he wants. He is an author of comparable skill, if not comparable success (yet).

      Alexander, get that agent and get pitching for Netflix series! They want fantasy and superheroes, Limelight is ideal for that! (And I want to see Alan Tudyk play Galen.)
      ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      If it would be a revelation that Joon and the author are the same I bet it wouldn't be portrayed like that.

      All you'd have to do is have Joon return to earth and start writing his story online and that's what the author is
      ```

  - u/catern:
    ```
    I meant to class that under "The DM is someone completely unknown", although I guess it doesn't really fit there. But yeah, that's a plausible result too.
    ```

- u/Tenoke:
  ```
  Another theory: The DM really isn't Joon and they really are kindred spirits. DM just entity-searched throughout worlds for someone similar to him on specific axes but not necessarily others.

  And in general, all the arguments about being satisfactory or not as a reveal might have missed the tons of subversions in the story.

  ```
  Nice find, I like it.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Personally I think the DM is a transhuman iteration of Juniper torturing a smaller version of himself for the Shadenfreude of it.
  ```

- u/cdr_popinfrsh:
  ```
  I may have missed a critical line somewhere, but I've been assuming the DM was older Joon. Is this disproven somewhere?
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    It's not "disproven," but:

    >“You’re … not me,” I said. I was staring. There were similarities between us, not just in the jeans and hoodie he was wearing -- a pretty classic outfit for me, back when I’d been on Earth -- but his hair color, eye color, and skin color too. But looking at his lips, nose, and eyes, I couldn’t see myself in him, not even allowing for the fact that he was older than me.
    >
    >“Says something about you,” he said. “That you assumed that the person behind all your perceived misfortune would be yourself.”

    At the very least, it's not *explicitly* older Joon.
    ```

    - u/cdr_popinfrsh:
      ```
      See, I read that and took it as DMJoon altering his features a bit to keep from giving up the game, but that could be totally off base. I just have a hard time seeing the DM as anybody *except* older Joon, given how tied the world is to the worlds he created in his head. Especially aspects like Fel Seed that weren't cribbed from another pre-existing campaign.  


      Edit: either DMJoon altering his features, or Joon just not wanting to see it. He can be pretty blinded to stuff relating to himself sometimes.
      ```

      - u/Nimelennar:
        ```
        Oh, I totally agree that that's the most likely interpretation.

        On the other hand, Joon thinks the DM isn't Joon, and you'd think he'd be the expert.

        Back on the first hand, Joon would know how to fool Joon into thinking he's not Joon...

        And so on.

        It all depends on how many layers you think AW is playing on.  Going strictly by the text above, it's not Joon.  One layer down, you'll notice that the DM doesn't outright *deny* being Joon.  A layer below that, and you'll notice that Joon, an experienced DM, doesn't notice this and call it out as an obvious attempt to misdirect without lying.  But then we know that the DM can snap his fingers and reset the conversation to an earlier point until it goes the way he likes, and we have no assurances that we're seeing the first iteration of the conversation...

        You could go around and around in circles forever arguing whether that chapter implies that Joon is the DM, or implies that he isn't.

        My own opinion is that it's being left deliberately ambiguous, so I'm open to the idea of the DM being other characters than Joon.  But then, I believed that the identity of the antagonist in HPMOR was being left deliberately ambiguous, and the author has said that wasn't the case, so take that for what it's worth.

          The DM is Juniper, who has had a psychotic break, and this entire story is taking place in his head while he's been locked in a treatment facility.

        ```
        Or the DM could be *partially* Joon (maybe an amalgam character/creation), or an alternate-timeline version of Joon, or a four-dimensional mathematical-attractor metastable Joon-analog, or a magical AI based off Joon, or a meta-entad cluster emulating Joon to a degree...

  Obviously DM is the call of gold and he is simulating Aerb because the real gold is comedy gold.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  My craziest brainstory is that the GM is an AI made by future Joon.  Basically, future Joon made an AI to entertain and heal his comatose friend.  Shit went wrong, something like Arthur being fundamentally unhealthy or giving him what he is supposed to want keeps making him miserable.  So Aerb turned into the grimdark version it is now.  

  Joon goes in to fix it and the AI has now combined his deep-seated self-hatred with Arthur's arrogance, helplessness, and misogyny to create the mess that is current Aerb.  The game was originally set up for Arthur 2.0, but starts adapting when Joon lets the first version of Amaryllis die.  

  It's so tenuously supported that I don't even consider it a theory, but it's fun.
  ```

  ```
  I dont think Joon is a real person. Stupid name, stupid town name of Bumblefuck, unrealistic rpg adventures, way to advanced rpg adventures, way to inteligent teenagers, way to articulate teenagers and finally only person with modicum of real behavior is DM.

  So DM is a player/programer, playing custom rpg game and every person inside is fake, and Joon is just a cover for a player like Shepard in mass effect. Just like Shepard, Joon is also being accosted by hot horny alien babes and plot convienicences.

  That being said, its possible we are analyzing this way to much, and its just another isekai litrpg.
