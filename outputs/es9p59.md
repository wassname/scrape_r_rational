  This is a great story, story writer.
  I died and instantaneously resurrected from laughter on the:

  "Do you vape?" - asked one of the six children who knows it could have been anyone

    Truly a great mystery but it's possible to solve it using process of elimination if you keep track of who has / hasn't asked a question.

  Edit: Why did I just at this moment realize THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OOMPA LOOMPA SONG ABOUT VAPING
  ***!!!THERE'S GOING TO BE AN OOMPA LOOMPA SONG ABOUT VAPING!!!***

  There's just so MUCH. I googled "Sudanese Blister Beetle," and discovered [My Uncle Oswald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Uncle_Oswald), a 1979 adult novel written by Dahl.

  >"Go fuck yourself."

  >"If you had told me an hour ago, maybe, but not now."

  Because that's when the Bucketbot/Bucketclone/Original Charlie Bucket was still alive

  Jekssimil is apparently a real but very uncommon Portuguese name.

  There's a Spanish footballer named Uxío Marcos.

  There's a [bunch of famous Rochas.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocha_(surname\))

  There's an [Uzbekistani singer named Ozodbek Nazarbekov](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q4312092), and not too many more Ozodbeks on the English-speaking side of the Web or the easily-googlable wider Web.

  In Portuguese, "reveles" is the second person singular present form of [revelar](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/reveles), or translated to English, "You reveal." I wonder if JUROR will be facilitating, receiving, or performing the Fudge Revelation.

  I have performed highly scientific anagrammatical analysis of JUROR's full legal name. You will be happy to know that "JEKSSIMIL UXIO ROCHA DE OZODBEK REVELES" is in fact easily rearranged to spell "I AM LORD CHILI SO SEEK BOOZE U VEXED JERKS"

  You heard it here first, folks: JUROR is actually Chili, drink up

    >When Uncle Oswald discovers the sexually invigorating properties of the "Sudanese Blister Beetle"', he devises a plan to steal the semen of great men and sell it to women who want to have children fathered by geniuses.

    I think you just uncovered the origin story for Chili. Or maybe the inspiration for the CHOCR thing ?
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    or alternatively JUROR doesn't really know how to spell, and thus the real name in his brain is some weird collection of letters that vaguely resemble it.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      JUROR definitely doesn't know how to spell his name, but this information didn't come from the PicoWonkites, but rather from Lim's Tarantaroo's hard drive, with the information sourced from the public record, I presume:

      >"No," said Lim. "You're a liar. And you are trying to annoy us. Me, specifically, I would assume, because you are wagering that I will get frustrated with your lack of progress, see both your terrible guesses and unwillingness to quit, and give you the right answer, which I do have saved on Taranturoo's hard drive, presumably out of a desire to show off my intelligence and/or continue on with the contest as soon as possible."
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Oh whoops yeah and it's also spelled out explicitly like that in the first chapter - I totally thought his name was more normal the first time I read it.
        ```

- u/ALowVerus:
  ```
  ```I VAPE```

  ```"That isn't your legal name," said Mr. Bucket.```

  ```"I vape," she said, crossing out her last answer and trying again.```

  Kill me now. I've reached the peak of human literature. All else is ashes in my mouth.

    SATIRICAL DECONSTRUCTION OF BELOVED SURREALIST WORK WRITTEN FOR AND PARTIALLY ABOUT THIS SUBREDDIT, coined by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/epr18b/rtwipff_chili_and_the_chocolate_factory_chapter_8/felpfgb/).

    - u/cthulhusleftnipple:

      It's not primairly rational because that isn't the purpos of the story, it might be rational as a side effect but it's main purpose to be an almost personal attack on the rational genre and everyone who likes it, it's like Getting Over It With Bennit Foddy: "I created this game for a certain kind of person, to hurt them."
      ```

      - u/zaxqs:
        ```
        Yeah it's anti-rational, which is a form of rational-adjacent. After all, most fiction is rational-orthogonal rather than rational or anti-rational.

        I would agree that an obscure in-joke of a tag, inappropriate and inconsistent, conveys the most accurate information possible on this fic. The most likely reaction for a new reader will be "wait, what even is that?", which is apropos.

        Lack of searchability is a fair point, though.

        I didn't mean it as a jab, just a joke that's perfectly fitting to the fic. RT-ADJ would be pretty boring.

  Pretty fun chapter. I guess Bucket has become to resemble Wonka more and more over the years. He feels like much different person than kid Charlie.
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    I currently assign ~30% probability Wonka is immortal and has stolen Charlie Bucket's identity to hide that fact (in addition to faking his own death in 2005 and somehow driving the original Bucket to his spectacular suicide.) The very simple reason he has staged another competition is that it's past time for him to take another "heir" and protect the secret of his immortality.

    Edit: bumping up to ~70% probability *some* kind of life extension shenanigans are in play: I just read Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator for the first time in many years and Wonka-Vite exists in-universe: a pill that makes you 20 years younger (stacking.) Wonka claims he doesn't want to "waste" them on himself because they're too valuable (then proceeds to waste 26 of them on shenanigans.)
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, the first thought that came to mind when Wonka's funeral was mentioned was "So the Great Glass Elevator isn't canon here, is it?".

      I like your theory better.
      ```

- u/gryfft:
  ```
  /u/Makin- I laughed aloud when I saw the tag. I'm not necessarily advocating that we should keep using it moving forward, but I was significantly tickled to see it and agree that it's a joke that is perfectly fitting to the fic.

  I kept copying quotes to put in this comment because they were so delightfully clever, but there's just too many of them, so I'll settle for:

  >"Why don't you change it back?" asked Keerthi. "You are an autocratic king. Surely you could change your name back if you wanted to."

  >"I am much too busy," said Mr. Bucket.

  >"But you would only have to say it," said Keerthi. "Then it would be law."

  >"Again, very busy. But thank you for the terrible legal advice. Now please hurry up and sign."

  Thanks for the chapter, gazemaize. Or, to use your *legal* name, Delightful Convoluted Postmodern Story Lad.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Seems like Keerthi's role might be a bit similar to Mike Teavee's in the original book.

    > 'It would suit you very well,' said Mr Wonka, 'but unfortunately the mixture is not quite right yet. I've got it too strong. It works too well. I tried it on an Oompa-Loompa yesterday in the Testing Room and immediately a huge black beard started shooting out of his chin, and the beard grew so fast that soon it was trailing all over the floor in a thick hairy carpet. It was growing faster than we could cut it! In the end we had to use a lawn mower to keep it in check! But I'll get the mixture right soon! And when I do, then there'll be no excuse any more for little boys and girls going about with bald heads!'

    > 'But Mr Wonka,' said Mike Teavee, 'little boys and girls never do go about with . . .'

    > 'Don't argue, my dear child, please don't argue!' cried Mr Wonka. 'It's such a waste of precious time! Now, over here, if you will all step this way, I will show you something that I am terrifically proud of. Oh, do be careful! Don't knock anything over! Stand back!'

    Or this one:

    > 'She'll be purple? cried Mr Wonka. 'A fine rich purple from head to toe! But there you are! That's what comes from chewing disgusting gum all day long!'

    > 'If you think gum is so disgusting,' said Mike Teavee, 'then why do you make it in your factory?'

    > 'I do wish you wouldn't mumble,' said Mr Wonka. 'I can't hear a word you're saying. Come on! Off we go! Hurry up! Follow me! We're going into the corridors again!'

    Or this one:

    > 'Thank you,' said Mr Wonka. 'I shall now tell you how this amazing television set of mine works. But first of all, do you know how ordinary television works? It is very simple. At one end,
    where the picture is being taken, you have a large ciné camera and you start photographing something. The photographs are then split up into millions of tiny little pieces which are so small that you can't see them, and these little pieces are shot out into the sky by electricity. In the sky, they go whizzing around all over the place until suddenly they hit the antenna on the roof of somebody's house. They then go flashing down the wire that leads right into the back of the television set, and in there they get jiggled and joggled around until at last every single one of those millions of tiny pieces is fitted back into its right place (just like a jigsaw puzzle), and presto! — the photograph appears on the screen ...'

    > 'That isn't exactly how it works,' Mike Teavee said.

    > 'I am a little deaf in my left ear,' Mr Wonka said. 'You must forgive me if I don't hear everything you say.'

    > 'I said, that isn't exactly how it works!' shouted Mike Teavee.

    > 'You're a nice boy,' Mr Wonka said, 'but you talk too much. [...]'

    In other words, wasting Wonka/Charlie's time and mumbling a lot.

      Dahl was certainly a master of portraits of nasty, disrespectful children and the poor adults who have to deal with them, and this fine work carries on the tradition brilliantly.

      Oh no I'm quoting the story again

      >"No, it isn't. It isn't your legal name and it isn't even the name my Wonkites detected you wanting to be called. Chili Floss is a silly ridiculous pretend name you made up," said Mr. Bucket, who was once given a chocolate factory by a man named Willy Wonka.

      I love this so much I got shivers.
      ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    To be fair, in order to do it legally he'd have to put his finger on his nose and say it five times, and really who has time for that?
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      Unbelievably busy, what with the influx in immigration, composition of legal documents, his duties as tour guide, and okay I'm hijacking my own comment in the middle of it to paste another quote out of context from the story because I literally can't stop myself

      >And I don't think I need to repeat myself, but please do not touch the walls. I do not want any of you to be lit on fire right now."

      >"Or ever," added Keerthi.

      >"Sure," said Mr. Bucket.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Honestly Bucket personifies the inherent schizophrenia of a nation-state: I don't want to hurt anyone, but I will literally turn you into delicious malt balls if you so much as breathe wrong.
        ```

    - u/OnlyEvonix:
      ```
      That may actually be justified, I mean how many times does the ruler of a nation need to sign his legal name?

- u/CannedRealm:
  ```
  Anyone have any idea what Chili’s real name could be? Groinflogger like his grandpa?
  ```

  - u/Makin-:
    ```
    It has to be a mispelled form of Chill Lee, since 

    >"No, look," said the BFG, who knew how to read. "It says that he won! But it also spelt his name wrong."

    Though it usually uses the initials of the first name, so I have no idea.
    ```

    - u/The_Wadapan:
      ```
      wait, but wasn't part of the deal this chapter that the website names weren't the "true" names at all, just what they preferred to be called?
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        Then why wouldn't it be C. Floss, and why would Chili need to change his name in the first place?
        ```

        - u/CannedRealm:
          ```
          > “That is my real name. I’m Chili Floss,” said Chili Floss.

          > “No, it isn’t. It isn’t your legal name and it isn’t even the name my Wonkites detected you wanting to be called. Chili Floss is a silly ridiculous pretend name you made up,” said Mr. Bucket, who was once given a chocolate factory by a man named Willy Wonka.

          I think this along with what the BFG said about misspelled Chill Lee means his name displayed as just “Chili” on the website because that’s what he wanted to be called.

          And it seems like Chili is super defensive about what his real name is so that’s why he “legally” changed it rather than reveal it.
          ```

          - u/Makin-:
            ```
            So Chili has a true name, but he just wants to be called "Chili" when he solves the riddle, and by the time of the factory tour he wants to be called "Chili Floss"?

            I guess that fits.
            ```

            - u/Badewell:
              ```
              I read it as he has a legal name we don't know, goes by Chili Floss, and has a completely different name that he would very much like to be called but doesn't want to admit it (that probably is very close to C. Lee, because of the misspelling comment).

              My guess is his preferred name being something he'd be embarrassed by, but I haven't been able to think of anything that works. Maybe he secretly wants to be so happy that he'd want his name to be Glee?

              eta- Wait, JUROR and Keerthi both begin to call him "Ch-". So a name that begins in Ch that is close to C. Lee that isn't Chili? Chilly, and he has a secret desire to go to Antarctica?
              ```

              - u/IICVX:
                ```
                I went back a couple of chapters, and when Chili was still trying to win the contest by entering in something he likes more than anything else he puts in something that was (probably) ridiculously heartwarming but which isn't explicitly stated.

                So yeah he probably just wants a normal name or something.
                ```

    - u/Chosen_Pun:
      ```
      I honestly assumed the website did indeed display "C. FLOSS," and the BFG just thought that was how badly it misspelt his name; and that the Chili/Chill Lee pun operated independently for us, the readers.
      ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    I think everyone is ignoring the possibility that Chili himself doesn't know his own name, likely being just 'stupid kid' according to his grandfather
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    > She petted Chetan and whispered to him that she was sure she would figure it all out by the end of the contest.

    In the previous chapter, he's once referred to as Chetan.

      ```
      > [Keerthi] had one big skin tag on the middle of her nose and sometimes ever since she was little when she was alone she would wiggle it in front of the mirror and call it Chetan and have silly conversations with it.
