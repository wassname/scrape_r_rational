## Looking For a Dozen Wise Readers

### Post:

The Wise Reader is a technique recommended by none other than Orson Scott Card to help you improve your writing. [In his own words,](http://wisereaders.livejournal.com/900.html) 

>A Wise Reader is not someone to tell you what to do next--it's someone to tell you what you have just done. In other words, you want your spouse or friend to report to you, in detail and accurately, on the experience of reading your story.

As Card explains, a crucial kind of feedback that is often difficult for a writer to get is the experience the reader has in the moment of reading. Afterwards the reader will lie and tell you your story is great and that they really liked the main character, or, alternatively, they might try to give you literary critiques like "too much dialogue." But a Wise Reader doesn't tell if if the story was good or bad or how you can fix it. Rather,

> All he can tell you is what it feels like to read it.

Card recommends the use of specific questions about how the reader felt about different aspects of the book to train a Wise Reader to pay attention to their own reactions. That way a Wise Reader can provide you a certain kind of feedback that is otherwise difficult for a writer to get, namely, the honest experience of reading the story. But why have one Wise Reader when we can have a reddit's full?

I think it's worth trying this out. It's not any costlier than reading things we were reading anyway and just paying a bit more attention to how it feels to read it, and it could help us all become much better writers. Naturally, I don't mind using my own (revised) [attempt at a first chapter](http://archiveofourown.org/works/1115107) here as an experimental prototype. In the spirit of rationality, let's try this out and determine if and how this can work and what it can do to improve our writing.

So without further ado, here are the questions I'd like any Wise Readers out there to answer honestly once they've read the chapter. Most of these are taken or extrapolated from Card's own suggestions linked to above.

**Were you ever bored? Did you find your mind wandering? Can you tell me where in the story this was happening? (Take your time, look back through the story, find a place where you remembers losing interest.)**

**What did you think about the character named Korra? Did you like her? Hate her? Keep forgetting who she was? Generally, what did you feel about her?**

**Was there anything you didn't understand? Is there any section you had to read twice? Is there any place where you got confused?**

**Was there anything you didn't believe? Any time when you said, "Oh, come on!"**

**What did you think about the firebending test? Was it interesting? Boring? Believable? Implausible?**

**What do you think will happen next?**

**What are you still wondering about?**

**What did you think about Arnook? How did you react about him as a person? What did you feel about his relationship with Korra?**

And, since I've never done this before either,

**What kinds of things haven't I asked about that I should have?**

Or, to put it another way, I don't see why I would want it your reactions to Korra but not to Meelo. It's not the same amount of importance but they're both important. If you feel like you understand what a Wise Reader is supposed to do, please tell me how you felt and reacted to every character, event, line of dialogue, every bit of description, etc. The only rule is to only give me your reactions to the text, how you felt reading it, *not literary diagnosis and prescription.* E.g. tell me, "Korra was boring. I didn't really like her." Don't tell me, "Korra is poorly characterized. Try giving her dead parents as a tragic backstory." I don't mind diagnosis and prescription (in fact, I welcome it in any other forum), but *it's not what a Wise Reader does.* If it seems like a good idea, then we'll get better at this with time.

Thanks for helping me out. I hope Wise Reading and having Wise Readers helps your writing improve. Start your own threads if you like this idea, or, if you prefer, we can just make this post into the Wise Reader Post where anyone can request a Wise Reader or three to Read their story.

**How To Tell if You're Wise Reading Or Not:**

Maybe the key to understanding when a comment is Wise Reading or something else is to realize that a Wise Reader can **never be wrong**. A Wise Reader is reporting their own feelings. A Critical Reader or a Helpful Reader **can** be wrong.

For example, a **Wise Reader** will say, "I was bored by Korra." A **Critical Reader** will say, "Korra is boring." A **Helpful Reader** will say, "Give Korra a personality transplant and a cybernetic arm. That'll make her interesting." The key difference is that the Wise Reader is definitely right, or, at the very least, if he's wrong, the writer has no ability to know that. The Critical and Helpful Readers, on the other hand, *might very well be wrong.* One reader's opinion is not proof that Korra is boring. Giving her a cybernetic arm might not make her interesting. But if a reader says, "I was bored," he's right, period, end of story.

  This is why God invented Google Docs.  Seriously: the highlight-and-comment features are great for editing.

    Agreed. Critiquing this would rate much higher in my list of "things I want to do" if a Google Doc were available.

  Just started reading, but right off the bat, I'm going to say that the intro doesn't work. We don't know enough to be engaged in the passive narration, and there are a number of times where it draws you out of the story:

  "although who combed them no one can say."

  "What his unfocused eyes see, no one has ever asked."

  Additionally, this saying, whether real or not, does not make sense:

  >As the people of the city are fond of saying, If you don't enter the tigers den, you will never catch its cub. By which they mean, stay out of the tiger's den!

  This: 

  >*First, survive.*

  Should be where your story starts. It's far too good a beginning line to waste, and as I think I saw being discussed earlier, in medias res is unnecessary for a character as potentially compelling as the Avatar.

  >Korra held still, gazing up at the sky, the long green shimmering patterns filling a hazy red sheet. And some part of Korra knew that as long as she remained looking at the southern lights, she would not die.

  Is she becoming delusional at this point? Because as a reader I see no reason for this belief.

  The amount of sleepy confusion before and during the celebration is too high. It's disorienting and jarring as a reader to keep getting pulled in and out of lucidity for so long. You can make the same point while still cutting it down, and change the mid-celebration drowsiness to her mind wandering instead.

  >"*I* would like to go with Tenzin," Korra said. 

  This final comment of hers, especially in context, doesn't really fit, and the emphasis doesn't seem to have a purpose.  This entire scene seems a bit off to me, and it might be better to use the cartoon's setting for the same conversation rather than having Korra force it so early.

  This leads to my being able to answer the first question of yours:

  I like the way Korra is portrayed in some regards, but in others she's just annoying. We want to sympathize with her chafing under Arnook's rules, and Katara's brief perspective helps with that, but in the end he's right: she IS immature and reckless, and that makes it hard not to see her as a brat without redeeming qualities.

  Speaking just on a personal note: I would much rather Korra be smart and, if not mature, at least more observant. It's okay for her to be impulsive, but verbally bashing her head into a wall just makes her look dumb.  Her major flaws should be her overconfidence and inability to bend: she doesn't also need to be so bad at reading a situation and knowing when those she's talking to aren't listening to her.

  >"You will go to Republic City and tell Tenzin that if he doesn't train you, I will cuff him behind the ear. Hmph! *My* son is certainly not going to refuse to train the Avatar. When I speak to his father about this..."

  Confusing. Whose thoughts are these? It seems like Aang's at first, but "when I speak to his father about this" contradicts that.

  Also, think about cutting the whole dialogue exchange with Unalaq, maybe put it at the beginning of the next chapter, especially if you're going to have it be a recurring thing.  It doesn't fit where it is.

  Overall, there are a lot of small things I enjoyed: Korra's sense of self as the avatar is done really well, especially her belief that, despite others' disappointment in her, she brings something unique to the table.  Her using her connection to the previous Avatars is amusing too: I could imagine her faking a trance and trying to "channel" Aang to tell Tenzin off at some point.

  The fire bending test was neat, though you use the "dragon" analogy a bit too often: once is enough, and afterword as descriptors (like a replacement for "master") is fine.  The other characters work, though I don't feel a particular bond to any of them but Katara, not coincidentally because we have a couple sections from her perspective. One from Tenzin's, and maybe even Arnook's, wouldn't be a bad idea.  Right now Arnook just seems rigid and bothersome.  If we knew that he knows just how dangerous the world out there has become, it would suddenly make a bit more sense to have him keeping Korra secluded until she's "ready."

    Thanks, it's helpful, but it's a bit more than a Wise Reading. I added in some links to the OP that clarify what a Wise Reader is supposed to do and not do. Want to do an Exchange?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Thanks for clarifying. Do you want to limit the feedback you get then, or...? The language may have been off, but I did my best to limit my feedback to the areas Card specifies: what confused me, what lost my interest, what didn't sit right.

      My understanding is that Wise Reading is more useful once the story is more firmly set. To put it more frankly, Wise Reading can help a good story become great, but when still on one of the early, rougher drafts, there are structural issues that still need to be worked out.

      What's an Exchange?

  Indeed. Something to add to the sidebar? Many thanks, WAT.

    Also, typo thread.

    >"Not," they said, "Yet."

    The "yet" shouldn't be capitalized.

    >The find the Avatar

    Should be "They find the Avatar"

    Is "Human Killer" a name from canon? Because... Seriously? "Human Killer"?

    >"Everyone is watching you.

    Missing close-quote.

    >And wasn't Arnook always telling her that the Avatar must be worldly and not tied to one place?

    Shouldn't it be "*not* worldly"?

    >Arnook bowed briefly to Tenzin and clasping Pema's hand.

    Verb confusion there. Should be "clasped".
    ```

- u/G01denW01f11:
  ```
  OP, if you don't get enough here, there's a site called Scribophile you might want to check out. People tend to have very useful feedback there. And there's an active group devoted to fanfic, so no worries about being (completely) glossed over due to 'prejudice.' 

  As a note, I prefer not to ask questions of my readers until after I've gotten their feedback. If someone mentions a problem you specifically ask about, that's slightly different than if they mention a problem you didn't.
