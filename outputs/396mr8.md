## How rational do you feel The Sandman was?

### Post:

The Neil Gaiman series, if that needed clarification. 

EDIT: I should clarify that I wasn't asking with reference to the cosmology, but to characters and actions. "Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being 'good' or 'evil'", &c.

  Not very rational, but that's more because the characters were believably irrational - they had that element of myth and mystery. It's a pretty wonderful piece of work, though.

  I wouldn't call Sandman a rationalist fiction.
  However that doesn't mean the work was without merit.
  The series is an exploration of human nature  through the use mythic and occult imagery.
  It still has a lot to so say even though its not strictly rational.

  You should also read Lucifer the spinoff series if you enjoyed Sandman.

    What about the Thessaly one? Any good?

      Hell yes!
      But a tad confusing at the end.

  It was arational. It was an exploration of myths as the fundamental bbuilding blocks of the universe, and the personifications of experiences that are fundamental to life as we experience it, but have no connection to material physics.

    The lack of connection to 'material physics' has nothing to do with rationality or lack thereof; give me magic and I'll work with magic.

    I agree with you that the work is arational, but that's because none of the mythic characters and few of the mortals have consequentialist desires in the sense of visibly wanting particular future outcomes.  To write rationalfic in the setting, you'd either need to insert a human protagonist that wanted the future to have some particular property, or drastically change the character of one of the mythic characters.

      The plot arc of Destruction. In particular, his walking away from his role, without being replaced, or altered into a new role, could be the seed for something that took place pre-sandman.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    Assuming that Death cared about long lives. That doesn't appear to be a priority of hers though, from what I recall. She seems interested with easing the transition, but that doesn't necessarily imply that her value system cares about keeping people alive (especially since, IIRC, people really do go to the afterlife).

        Ah. It's been awhile since I've read it, and I forgot about some of those aspects (of Death especially).  

        Thanks for taking the time to spell them out instead of going "Go read the Wikipedia articles, you idiot!" 

        (Which you would have been totally justified in doing, I might add)

        The problem with dealing with the Endless in general is that the personality is always a slave to their nature.

        Death, no matter how much she likes someone, is always going to be the last one standing in the end.

        Destiny is always going to be helpless to change any fate he sees.  

        Desire is always going to going to be a slave to every whim, pleasant and unpleasant, kind and cruel that occurs to ... (hir? Desire is also always going to be havok to pronouns)  

        Even Destruction, in denying his nature and embracing creativity is buggered. Every thing he makes during his appearance is effectively useless. The large dinner he makes, no-one eats. The art he makes, has only an uncultured dog to appreciate it...

        It's ultimately a story about Dream getting pissed off about it, and changing it in the most direct way he can. (Which isn't direct at all tbh)

  Not very? I mean, it's all predicated on the main character acting like a depressive tit all the time. And the rules of the universe are basically it works like how you believe it does.
