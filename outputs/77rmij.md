## Is Fullmetal Alchemist rational fiction?

### Post:

Have only watched the first episode yet, but it seems like quite an interesting concept. There seem to be additional rules in that universe that the characters take intelligent advantage of. 

What's your take?

  I'd say it's rational adjacent.  It makes some efforts in that direction, it has some moments that people in this sub would likely love, but I wouldn't call it actually rational.  More like a halfway point between rational and shonen.  Fully awesome, though.

  Don't know about the non-Brotherhood version, but the manga that Brotherhood is based on is fairly close. There weren't any "plot demands it" that I can remember, the antagonists have somewhat unique beliefs and values, characters use intelligent solutions to problems, the world... sort of has consistent rules? 

  The magic is really the main bit of fuzziness to be honest, it's sometimes well developed but there's no real explanation given as to why some alchemists are experts in some things versus others. Sometimes the reason for an alchemical secret is revealed, but often times it's not, and you're just left thinking "Well I guess he just had a secret rare formula/diagram."

  That aside though, it's pretty fantastic and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for new anime.

  No because the defeat and demise of almost all the antagonists is based on them making a continuous chain of stupid\ineffective decisions.

  The beginnig arcs were pretty decent in this regard because at that point the author was just gradually unveiling the setting, and the "villains" didnâ€™t have to be muzzled yet.

  But afterwards the main characters had to start winning somehow against incredible odds, and so the antagonists became bumbling caricatures of their previously depicted selves.

  Also No because the most basic premise of the story, the idea of equal exchange, is flawed with "humanity bias". Just because we-the-humans see some things as having roughly similar values doesn't mean the objective universe would have the same notions.

  This second point can be ameliorated somewhat by saying that magic\"alchemy" itself comes from a conscious, subjective entity. But that would be a rather cliche handwave explanation for problems like this.

    Well... [doesn't it?](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fma/images/e/e8/Truth.png/revision/latest?cb=20141129164933)

    It's been a while since I read the manga but I thought the equivalent exchange is a lie spread by the non-existent child?

    It's a cliche for a reason.

  It gets less rational by the end I'd say (at least classic, haven't watched brotherhood)

    ```
    If you're ever hankering for a rewatch, go for Brotherhood. It's one of my favorite manga, and Brotherhood follows it much more closely :)

      Brotherhood is the one I'm watching
