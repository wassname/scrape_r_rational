  It's certainly clear that it's trying to satirise some common xianxia themes, but the character isn't developed enough for me to care about him before the story starts going into Fancy Powers. Speedrunning through the "powerless to Actual Fighter" arc in two paragraphs doesn't do it any favours.

  More to the point, the character never actually demonstrates any intelligence - rather, we're just told how smart he is.
