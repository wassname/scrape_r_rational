## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have the power to continually reincarnate after brain death. You'll be born from a random human mother and will contain none of your past lives' memories until someone intentionally speaks your distinct password to you. This password, chosen at your first incarnation, unlocks your soul from your unconscious mind. 

  The password must be unique enough that you wouldn't be unlocked by a mundane word and something that could be more or less spelled out phonetically by most literate people just by hearing it said.

  When unlocked, you gain your first incarnation's memories as well as the memories incarnations where you were unlocked. This includes their learned knowledge and to some extent skills that they learned. The process is spontaneous, but automatically, "smooths" things out to prevent you from suffering much trauma from being unlocked or any other consequences of having lifetime(s) dumped into your mind.

  However, being unlocked also gives you the acquired, treated/untreated psychological trauma of your past lives and you won't be entirely protected against feelings of loss and other attachments. 

  Your innate personality remains constant across all incarnations, even if they're locked. 

  How would you munchkin this power?

  How would you reverse munchkin this power? Your only knowledge is that there was a egotistic rationalist currently living who'd found a way to unlock three previous incarnations with the goal of obtaining power over humanity.

    I think we need stricter definitions for what the password can be. What is meant by “mundane word”? I think I’d go for something like “scalene”. It’s probably obscure enough, and I’d expect it to be activated in every lifetime that I go to school in childhood, even in the future. Probably activates around age 10-13? If I never go to school I could realistically not hear it until late in life, so it’s not ideal. “Algorithm” is also pretty good for a teenage start, don’t know if it passes your phonetic test.

    If it’s needs to be a one-on-one conversation and teachers won’t work then I’d choose something related to reproduction, get activated during the Talk. I’m also assuming this is working across languages, because I think the phonetic restriction doesn’t make sense otherwise.

    I'd probably reverse-munchkin the power by not giving a shit. What's one person who doesn't have continuity of personal wealth or future-knowledge going to do? They're just a person who gets to not truly die. I might deeply resent them because *I* don't want to die either, but whatever.

      You could potentially set up a challenge with a reward (like the millennium problems) but instead of solving a maths problem which someone could theoretically beat you to, you can instead have the question be “decrypt this message”, the message being encrypted with a one time pad, you being the only person in the world with the key and can pretend that you cracked it somehow, this would result in you looking like a precocious child genius(and the fame which results from that label), getting your money from your previous incarnations and then you can make a similar seemingly philanthropic challenge in the name of encouraging development of the field and continue passing the money down (maybe there is a rule that states that anyone who accepts the prize must setup a similar challenge with a prize pool of atleast equal size, that way if one of the people looking after the unencrypted answer leaks it or cheats by abusing their position somehow, you won’t lose the money it will just be inaccessible for a lifetime).
      Instead of having future knowledge you can instead use your wealth to fund the passing of laws which censor information to prevent the growth of future technologies and decrease future discoveries, this means everyone else in the world will unfortunately have no improvement to their quality of life or life expectancy but you could get continual growth of both of those things.

        Okay, fine. In the meantime, odds are you've got a longer view on policy than anyone else, so it's likely that dealing with climate change is a high priority lest there be no more humanity to be reborn in. Have fun storming the castle!

    Just to clarify, are reincarnations sequential? That means if I die in 2001, I would reincarnate after 2001 or could I reincarnate in the past?

    Also, when physical skills get reintegrated, do they adapt to your new physiology?
    ```

    - u/Camaraagati:
      ```
      You'll reincarnate continually, seconds after your brain shuts down in your previous life, the sperm will hit an egg in your next.

      Physical skills adapt to your new body as much as they can without breaking other physical laws.

      I feel like making your password a famous soft drink is the best way to go. Coca Cola is famous world-wide and most importantly it's pretty much the same in multiple languages.

    It is simple enough to choose a common brand name as the password. Like "America", or "Google". The problem is they won't last forever. After a few millennia, they may no longer exist, and then your password will never be said again. 

    Which suggests another approach: using sounds that will never die until humanity goes extinct. I'm thinking either "AHHHH!" or "ssss", which are sounds that people make occasionally and will never go away completely. They are not mundane words, and they can be phonetically pronounced. 

    The problem then, is this constraint:

    >  until someone intentionally speaks your distinct password to you. 

    What does that "intentionally" actually mean? Do they have to be intentionally speaking to you specifically? So it doesn't work if they are speaking to a large audience or in an online video clip? Do they have to intentionally speak your password while KNOWING that it is your password? But how would they know they know your password and it isn't just a lie your previous incarnations told them? Reincarnation could be treated as a hoax after all.

    Also do they need to know what exactly the password is for or will do? What if you just trick the world's mothers into thinking your password is a magic word that will make babies who listen to it become smarter? The mothers would 'know' that they are speaking a password to their babies, but they wouldn't know what that password is really for. Would that work?

        I don't understand how this applies to anything I wrote.

        I also did see that part, and since I wrote:

          "The password must be unique enough that you wouldn't be unlocked by a mundane word" refers to the idea that your password *must be unique enough* to not be unlocked by e.g. a mundane word, not that your password specifically may not be a "mundane word", though this condition would certainly follow.

          "America" and "Google", for example, are clearly not very unique. They are words which are regularly spoken by average people from across the globe.
          ```

          - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
            ```
            Oh. I was interpreting "mundane" differently. I figured it meant words like "the", or "table", or "you", which would be super easy to abuse. I didn't think it would include made-up names, because if they do, then a lot of the proposed plans in this thread won't work at all.

            You couldn't make a big company that popularizes its brand name or a catch phrase that includes your password, because then the name/phrase becomes very "common" and so very "mundane" and then the password wouldn't work anymore.
            ```

              The restriction is presumably a restriction on the choice of password. It's probably not a magical clause that, if contradicted for a given period of time, cause the password to not work for that period of time. I see no reason to read it like that other than to bring up this objection.

                The problem here is, if the 'mundanity' is defined only with regard to the current time, that means you can cheat by turning your password from a currently-not-mundane word to a future-mundane word. As in, changing mundane words like "the" or "you" or "table" into your password. For example, you could set your password to a slight mispronunciation of "the", then start a mass-misleading program of making people think that "the" is actually pronounced as the slight mispronunciation that is your password. Then your password would effectively become the mundane word "the", and be said nigh constantly in mundane usage, which would be incredibly strong.

                The other solutions like making your own brand/company/country/whatever, will create passwords that are only mentioned when someone talks about the brand/company/country/whatever, so the solutions are effectively limited to the lifespans of those brands/companies/countries. A mundane word like "the", barring the deliberate and expensive intervention that you did and that is utterly pointless for anyone else to do, will outlive the others by orders of magnitude.

                  > The problem here is, if the 'mundanity' is defined only...

                  I don't see the problem here. You're certainly allowed to make people say your password more often, including by engineering language. Although... If anyone here had the ability to make their own internationally famous brand/company/country/etc. they would do so, and substantially modifying the pronunciation of a common English word is similarly not a reliable plan.

          Even if sounds like "ahhh!" or "sss" count as passwords, there's also the requirement that they have to be intentionally said to the reincarnation. Is it really likely for someone to wordlessly scream or hiss *at* a person?

            I believe I speak for a whole lot of parents when I say noooooo, we definitely don't scream wordlessly at the baby, everrrrrrr. Definitely not. Nuh uh. No way. Um. Not even a little bit? Just, you know, a teensy bit. I mean, no! Not at all.

    Why do you think the catholic church still holds mass in latin?  Someone already set up the game.

    Also, this I think is less useful than Intended.  What advantage would knowing about whatever bits a history a random person would know in the future?

    Like, you remember how to hand craft a fine bow, very nice, your car broke down.  Nothing in thr past 10k years of human history will help you with this as much as a wrench.

    I would start a religion which main tenet is meeting 18 year olds, yelling "PLUMBUS, PLUMBUS, PLUMBUS!" at them, then showering them with gifts (say, a laptop, a cheap used car, a new smartphone etc)   


    The young person is then inducted into the cult that only has two tenets:  


    1. Be kind to other people.
    2. When you meet a 18 year old human, yell PLUMBUS at them and give them an useful gift.  


    Then I would spend some time in each reincarnation to reignite and enforce the cult, wrap it in Chaotic Good mystique, until it becomes a staple of global culture.

  For any piece of armor you wear with a volume bigger than 64 cubic centimeters, you can pick a specific material property to be applied over your whole body. So if you wear a boxing glove, anyone punching your body would feel the padding on the gloves. If you wear a shin guard, punching your body would be akin to punching a person wearing hard body armour composed of that shin guard. 

  Some rules:

  * For every piece of armor you wear beyond the first one, you must pick a specific property (chemical or physical) that would then be applied across your whole body. For example, if you wore a titanium bracer, you could pick titanium's toughness or stiffness as the property to get applied. Toughness would result in being able to take impacts better (would result in less displacement of your body), while stiffness would result in having a body that is harder to deform (harder to break bones, pierce skin, etc). You could wear ceramic kneepads for better heat resistance, or an aluminum foil hat to radiate away some heat energy so that you don't overheat as easily when in proximity to high temperature objects. 

  * When you pick a specific property to be applied, it overwrites any other piece of gear that had the same property applied. For example, if you wore aluminum and steel kneepads, you would only be able to pick one of the objects for their toughness, or stiffness, or conductance.

  * When damage is applied to your body not covered by the piece of armor, the damage is instead dealt to the piece of armor whose property contributed to its blocking. For example, if you wore steel and ceramic. Steel would block blunt/sharp impacts while the ceramic would block or resist heat. With enough damage it is possible to break the armor pieces. It is also possible to target the specific armor piece, which could also break with enough damage. In the previous case, a hard enough hit to the ceramic piece (something beyond steel's ability to absorb) would break it, and you would lose the protection of the ceramic. With enough heat the ceramic would melt, and you would lose its protective properties.

  * While you do gain the protective properties of each piece of armor you wear, you are still a human on the inside. It is more akin to being covered by a layer of the material over your whole body, that has the same thickness as the piece of armor you wear. Except that layer is solid, and yet you can move your body around as you would normally. A hard enough hit to your body will still kill or injure you. For example, you may be able to survive getting run over by a car, but the shock of it would still give you a concussion.

  Which materials do you choose if you have $1000 to outfit yourself? What about $100,000? And what about if you have infinite money and access to all the possible scientific materials (that are available in quantities above 64 cm^3).

  Barring protection, what are some cool/interesting things you can do with this power?

    For 1000 dollars I’d make a suit/cosplay of spongebob squarepants made out of very porous sponge and do charity skydives utilising the high air resistance property of the sponge to slow my fall and enjoy the views for a really long time. If I can’t use the air resistance property I’d instead use the elastic deformation of the sponge so that if I have an accident e.g. my parachute fails or I land badly, I am much more likely to be uninjured and survive (considering the last bullet point it’s unlikely this would leave you unharmed but atleast it would increase survival chances).
    Whilst this use is technically defensive I felt it was a different enough use of that defence to be posted.
    For 100,000 dollars I would compete in sumo wrestling utilising a loincloth that is lined with many powerful springs, I would use the spring’s resistance to being pushed as the property I use since I can use my opponents force against them and empower my own pushes with it.

    Is there any way to keep the effect running even for body parts that are separated? Or alternatively, parts that are added on?

    Because I'm thinking about equipping really strong/tough/hard/sturdy armors, and then applying the effects on my hair. Now that creates super strong/tough/hard/sturdy fibers, which, if my hair is long enough or can be disconnected, can be used to create all kinds of amazing items.

    It could even be applied recursively! Put on steel armor, now every strand of hair has the strength of steel. Tying them into a bundle makes them stronger than steel. Now sew your long hair into a stronger-than-steel cloth armor, equip it, make the effects on your body stronger, now your hair armor is stronger, so now it makes your power stronger, so the effects on your body become stronger, and so on!
