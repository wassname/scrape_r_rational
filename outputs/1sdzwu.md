  Very well-written, mechanically speaking, and yet it doesn't actually *do* much.  It almost kinda manages to sound appealing, but largely fails with its talk of, "This is all so awesome we can't even describe it!"

  If it's just *that* awesome, why are you writing?  What point do you expect to convey to our mere mortal minds?  If it's all so gloriously wonderful, tell us about your freaking breakfast!  Tell us what you do all day, who you do it with.  How do you work?  How do you travel?  How do you make love?

  And don't tell me that you *don't* eat breakfast, don't do anything with your days, don't have friends, don't work, don't travel, and don't have lovers.  Tell me you don't do any of the things I find meaningful and you've suddenly gone right over the line you were previously stradding into sounding like an orgasmium-driven nut.

  *What is the connection between you and me?*

    Knowing that Bostrom is a transhumanist advocate I'd wager this story wasn't meant to have literary merits and the whole things is more like a manifest. If I understood it correctly, the incomprehensibility is the whole point of this letter. "Life can be much, much more than it is now and this is real possibility. The future could be so incomprehensibly awesome that you can't even imagine what you'd miss if you fail at this." I think the story tries to depict what's at stake and how astronomical the stakes are. The same way it's really hard to get a grasp of really large numbers, it's also really hard to actually grasp **how** awesome the future could be, but if you actually understood this, it would override everything else in your decision making process.

    I think it was left intentionally vague because it has the same effect as "the unknown is scary". If you compared it to the everyday chores in our world, it would be like describing the 21th century by trying to find the equivalents from the 9th century "superfast flying carriage". If you described in detail what the future could be like, it would look bland, lame and possibly scary at least to *some* people, see /r/RetroFuturism. And there are always people who would say "I don't want to live like that" for any kind of scenario simply because everything different seems unpleasant. I personally didn't get the impression that it's just constant meaningless orgasmism every moment from now to eternity.

      > if you actually understood this, it would override everything else in your decision making process.

      You mean like it does for the professional rationalists who regularly semi-trollishly point out that everyone should become investment bankers just to donate to their organizations and thus bring on the Friendly Singularity a few days earlier, thus increasing the future population of immortal, wonderful superhumans by a few more millions?

      >"Life can be much, much more than it is now and this is real possibility.

      *Duh.*

      >The future could be so incomprehensibly awesome that you can't even imagine what you'd miss if you fail at this.

      That... doesn't really compute for me.  Surely if someone from the future is bothering to write a letter they can be bothered to actually communicate.

      >If you compared it to the everyday chores in our world, it would be like describing the 21th century by trying to find the equivalents from the 9th century "superfast flying carriage".

      Sure, we ride inside giant metal, mechanical birds that take us where we need to go, even if it's quite expensive.  But we still eat breakfast.

      >If you described in detail what the future could be like, it would look bland, lame and possibly scary at least to some people

      The whole point of the Fun Theory sequence is that it doesn't have to.  Though Eliezer does think the real-and-good future can and should be *scary*, which confuses me.  Shocking to those of us from the past yeah, shocking like how teenagers' music is shocking to parents, but that's *normal*.  I *expect* my kids to listen to music that shocks me; I'm not *scared* of it.

      I'm sorry, but I really feel a need to reply with, basically, "Do it faggot".

      I mean, come on, let's start with lower bounds.  Is the proposed future better than living in a volcano lair with catgirls?  Is it better than peace, prosperity, and hotblooded awesomeness among a galaxy of Spiral races?  Freaking specify something!
