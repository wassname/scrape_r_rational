## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Path of the Immeasurable Swarm [Worm/Cradle]](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/path-of-the-immeasurable-swarm-worm-cradle.86766/) is absolutely fantastic. 

  It is a post-GM Taylor from Worm in Cradle (Will Wight) crossover.

  The story does get bogged down in a >!tournament arc!< but picks back up again after that.
  ```

  - u/gfe98:
    ```
    I felt the fic was too close to one of those stories where an OC/SI tags along with the main cast while the canon rails plot happens. But I think it was indeed the arc that you mentioned where I dropped it. Does the story diverge significantly from canon Cradle?
    ```

      I had that same complaint and almost dropped it. But Taylor finally gets her agency back and the train leaves the track after the tournament arc!

  I'm Christmas shopping and looking for novels to give. The family members they're for have a bit different tastes than I, so I'm looking for some recommendations that are out of my usual wheelhouse:

  1. Historical (Fiction): Something that *maybe* has minor fantasy elements in it, but is mostly historical fiction and shows the author has really put in the legwork. I've been thinking about gifting [*The Wager*](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61714633) which I've heard good things about.

  2. Something a bit fun, maybe with Religion? Last year I printed and bound *Unsong* as a gift, and they (theology graduate) got a real kick out of it and enjoyed it immensely. 

  Any ideas?
  ```

  - u/ricree:
    ```
    For 1, perhaps consider the works of Guy Gavriel Kay. His works are technically set in a secondary world, but wear their historical inspiration *very* heavily.

    My personal favorite is The Sarantine Mosaic, a two book story inspired by Constantinople in the time of Justinian.

    Another good one is The Lions of Al-Rassan, inspired by reconquista Spain, and El Cid.

    As I mentioned [a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/17yl2xq/dc_deconstruction_fics_of_bureaucracy_is_bad_and/k9u57ug/):

    > Back in 1987 Harry Turtledove published *The Videssos Cycle*, which was effectively one long novel split into 4 books. At the start of the novel, a big chunk of a Roman legion gets transported to a different universe. Lacking any other viable options, their tribune takes advantage of pre-existing demand and sells their services the way a mercenary captain would.

    > It quickly becomes apparent that the dominant empire in the alien setting is closely patterned on the Byzantine empire during the Middle Ages (Turtledove's PhD is in Byzantine history.) 

    There is some magic, but it's rare and fairly low-key. The main character's sword cancels hostile magic, so fights are almost always mundane. Large engagements are also primarily mundane.

    Note that this is 1980s Turtledove, i.e. long before he started producing ever longer alternate history series with "a cast of thousands".

    Try [Christian Cameron](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/710888.Christian_Cameron)/[Miles Cameron](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6535608.Miles_Cameron), 2 aliases for the same author, for historical fiction and for Fantasy/SF, respectively. He's a history scholar and reenactor, I first learned of his works by meeting him at a HEMA((Historical European martial arts) event in Toronto. He does a lot of work to make sure his works, even the fantasy ones, have a lot of grounding details with regards to armor, sword fighting, horses, etc. I tend to enjoy his Miles Cameron stuff better, but it has more than minor fantasy elements. His medieval/ancient greece stuff is great too, though.

    The [*Doc Future trilogy*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Sandbox/DocFuture) by W.D. Rieder[^example ^review](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/poixjd/review_the_fall_of_doc_future/) features two different polyamory groups. The story's extremely rational and high quality, thought the sequel's plot arc felt "fabricated" to me.

    Bonus points: so far, the best depiction of a speedster character.

    There's another trilogy in which the main characters are forced by circumstances to remain in an active relationship and maintain it, but besides being another "harem plus" (1M, many F), the females here featured jealousy and at times aggressively maintained their position in the pecking order. This may be the opposite of what you're looking for, so I'm not sure if this is a match.

  I sort of recommend [Archmage Status](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/75401/archmage-status-action-magic-litrpg-isekai), with some caveats. It feels like a mix of Mage Tank and Outcast in Another World. Mage Tank like humor, but the protagonist has more feelings and emotions. The worldbuilding is a bit like Outcast. The worldbuilding is cool, the system is kinda soft, and I like the character dynamics. The author writes humorous dialogue pretty well. Once in a while the protagonist has an out of pocket horny thought, which takes me out a bit, but also feels realistic? It feels like a pretty realistic depiction of what an average dude who gets isekaid would do, which means it probably won't satisfy those of you who want to see competence and munchkining from page 1.

      Hmm, no single part of it is amazing or outside of the norm I guess. I found it to be a fun mix of sassy system, interesting and weird worldbuilding, and humor. Protagonist gets isekaid, wakes up in a cave, and is thrown into a survival situation that he does poorly in. His reaction to combat felt realistic in how raw and amateur it is. The worldbuilding and politics is interesting, but not groundbreaking. Just overall fun.

  LitRPG rec: [*Emperor of Solo Play*.](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/emperor-of-solo-play/)

  It's a cross between [happening inside VR] and [peggy sue].^1

  The uniqueness of this story is in how it manages to use audience engagement / monetisation as an additional attribute of the Gamer's power.^2

  The "solo play" aspect is about how prot uses a difficult skill-floor / high skill-ceiling class to solo gameplay scenarios that were intended for teams and raids. The minions provided by the Necromancer class in question can have animal-level, AI-powered, trainable intelligence, which was another interesting element of the story.^3

  It doesn't fully qualify as "rational", but prot's hyper-competent at what he does and the antags only make a few serious blunders across the plotline (AFAIR).

  Prot himself is of the "little backstory" variety. I.e. not much screentime and internal monologue is being dedicated to things other than the gameplay itself (e.g. his social life, other hobbies and interests, etc). 

  Title relations: [*DC Carl,*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/DungeonCrawlerCarl) [*Isekai Speedrun.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/e1h8gc/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f8rerq6/)

  -

  From the bad things, 

  * >!prot being chronically unable to leverage his in-game success and make it reflect in his RL-conditions!< is pretty much a running gag through the story that felt annoying to me

  * as with DC Carl, the numbers for viewcounts, money earned from monetisation, money spent on in-game purchases, etc were all over the place.

  ^1 the exact mechanics of this being possible are left off-screen and/or are a subject of artistic license

  ^2 the only other good one I remember doing something similar being *DC Carl*

  ^3 the third being how the VR setting was controlled by an AI, which removed one of the worst flaws of the VR-RPG sub-genre: biased system administrators / game designers

    Can someone share some advice on enjoying translated asian fics?   


    I consistently find it hard to connect with the main characters, the antagonists seem like one-dimensional assholes, and it never feels like MC earns a win. instead only seem to win because they have OP abilities, because they outsmart their opponents in a way that seems totally alien(i.e. how on earth did MC in this one figure out that the 3 women wanted to ambush him), or because they are improbably lucky(i.e. MC in Shadow Slave even repeatedly admits to this).   


    A lot of folks on this sub seems to enjoy those types of fics and my genre taste generally aligns fairly well with the sub, so it feels like there's something I am missing or some context that would let me enjoy them.

      >they outsmart their opponents in a way that seems totally alien (i.e. how on earth did MC in this one figure out that the 3 women wanted to ambush him)

      Though some of the other points you've mentioned are often valid bad writing tropes for asian novels / LitRPGs, this one and in this case is more a (valid) MMORPG thing than an asianlit thing.

      It's like [those tourist-targeting scams](https://i.imgur.com/vR7Tdkr.jpg) *(high res. pic)*, only evolving in a different environment that dictates a different logic. Making a mob train and siccing it on a target for a free kill and a chance of the victim dropping a good item upon death, getting the last hit to steal the XP / loot drop, orchestrating to get attacked to be able to kill without PK status, etc. Prot's saying he's experienced enough regarding these in general and the story's game in particular to recognise when someone's cooking such a scheme around him.

      -

      In a way maybe those MMORPG tropes *are* associated with Asian tropes, because of how popular MMORPGs are in Asian countries.

      Incidentally, that's also why I generally prefer Asian LitRPGs to Western ones. They pay more attention to these kinds of details, whereas the Western ones more often feel like re-skinned fantasy novels, especially the printed literature that didn't originate as web originals.

      >the antagonists seem like one-dimensional assholes

      You can give a try to [*Terror Infinity*](https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/terror-infinity) and [*Reincarnator*](http://www.novelupdates.com/series/reincarnator/) (at least up to Green / Blue zones). The former showcases well strife between competing teams in a lawless environment, the latter showcases well human psychology in regards to prioritising short-term personal gains even when it leads to long-term communal losses.

      NU is primarily a database; its library function is rather lacking. You can usually find some chapters by various translators in the "Latest Release" section, but for many novels the full chapterlist won't be available.

      A "title + epub" google search usually finds the relevant story on some webnovel platforms. Especially if a fan translation project exists for that title.

  It absolutely is not rational, but it is HFY, which is... vaguely similar. And anyway, between it and fanfics of it, I've read about 200 chapters worth of [Nature of Predators](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/u19xpa/the_nature_of_predators/) content over the past couple days. With how quickly I've become addicted to it, I'd feel bad not recommending it.

  I especially recommend it to anyone else here who happens to be furry trash like me. And even if you don't like it, or think it's just okay, I'd say some of the aforementioned fanworks, such as [A Recipe for Disaster](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/10dh6rp/a_recipe_for_disaster_a_fanfic_of_nature_of/) actually surpass it (though, still far from rational).

  On that note... for anyone who's already read it, or is gonna give it a shot now...

  Does anyone have ANYTHING that hits upon similar ideas to Nature of Predators? I'm, uh, swiftly running out of content to read, at the rate I'm going though it all...

  EDIT: Forgot to mention that I've already read Three Worlds Collide.

  I'm going to be first time DMing in a few weeks. 

  1. How do I make compelling NPCs?

  2. Are there ways to compensate for not being great at improv?

  3. Any general advice?
  ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    **Compelling NPCs**: (I think that) for a character to be compelling, they need to be "rational" from their own personal perspective. The decisions they make are driven by the things they observe and how their internal logic analyses that input in combination with their experiences. Note that this internal process can seem strange, wrong, or irrational from the outside, but those outside observers probably don't know the past experiences, traumas, victories, etc, that have shaped this character's decision making process. 

    This means, when I'm creating an NPC, the first thing I start with is their Motivation (what do they want?) and their Backstory (why do they want it?). This can start out very simple, at the bottom of the Pyramid of Needs. For example, a beggar might want food because they are hungry. To add depth and complexity to characters, you can move up the Pyramid of needs towards the more abstract ones and create a layered set of, often interlocking, desires that compete within your character's heads. 

    Beyond this, making NPC's unique in some way greatly increases "compellingness". Give them a distinct personality, some strange quirk, or something they are passionate about. Also, don't limit this to non-physical traits. For example, maybe when your PC's successfully roll a perception check on the random NPC, they find out that one of the NPC's eyes is a fake glass eye. This immediately raises all sorts of questions for the PCs and makes this figure far more interesting, but requires basically no effort on your part as you don't need to have an explanation on hand (worldbuilding iceberg principle).

    **Compensate for not being great at improv:** Practice. Train. Git Gud. There's really no silver bullet or secret trick here. It's a skill, and by practicing, you will get better at it. Just don't sweat it. 

    What you can do as a cruch is front-load or pre-prepare improv. Comedians do this: they don't (usually) come up with their jokes live on stage, they spend a lot of time sitting around and planning their sets. Similarly, in D&D there are many, many, many people who have spent countless think-hours coming up with cool shit that you can use. For example, if you want a random encounter, you don't need to think of one yourself, there are plenty of tables out there where you can just roll dice to generate a scenario. 

    **General Advice**: Have fun and relax. It sounds cheesy, but D&D (or any TTRPG) is designed to be a fun social activity, first and foremost. If you and your players aren't enjoying yourselves, then what's the point? If it's your first time DMing, not everything will go perfectly, and that's expected and okay, just try to roll with it. Also, if you want to get better at being a DM / improv, you will need to play more games, and if your games aren't fun, players won't show up, limiting the amount of games you can play.
    ```
