  >Five hundred years after the Discord's first defeat, a lone unicorn scientist makes an interesting discovery. Across Canterlot, over the last few centuries, accident rates have increased in the area around the Royal Palace. His work is ridiculed by his peers, but comes to the attention of the Princesses, who know exactly what is happening: Discord is waking up. With Luna and Celestia, he concocts a plan to stop the Lord of Chaos forever.

  I wasn't expecting much when I read this, since the premise has been thrown around a few times and has been executed ... poorly. But this story is actually really good. Its style reminds me of Ian Banks's Culture books. Especially the ship names. The characters are surprisingly competent and there's a bunch of altered canon that works with everything else. Twilight and her friends are historical figures and Discord was never reformed, and the setting is in a future where the griffons have nukes.

  This is a rather depressing story

    Yeah, it's hard for me to enjoy a story where the only thing that happens is that everything just progressively gets more broken.
