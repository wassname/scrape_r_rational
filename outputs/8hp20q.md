  Chapter 6 is up! Hopefully next ones will be a bit faster, I've been slow writing recently because I enjoyed a bit less the current part. Still, it needed to be done to go through to the juicy parts. Next chapter in particular is a bit of a transition one.

  Will we find out how Goku and Bulma managed to best Mai?
  ```

- u/Silver_Swift:
  ```
  So, Bulma got a hold of Mai's phone, which means she (and presumably Goku) went back to the castle after escaping. [Previous prediction](#s "That makes my previous prediction that whatever the dragon radar is picking up in the castle and in Gokus bag are decoys less likely, otherwise why go back?").

  New predictions:

  - [Phone](#s "The bag contained some kind of trap that Mai sprung when she was searching for the DBs which rendered her unconscious and signaled Bulma that it was safe to go back.")

  - [Deal] (#s "Bulma is going to suggest cooperating on the wish in such a way that they both get what they want (and then probably betraying Pilaf in some way). Doesn't quite seem right, but otherwise I don't know what they have that Pilaf and co would be interested in trading for the last DB, I don't think Goku would be ok with them holding Mai hostage.")
