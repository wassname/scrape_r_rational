## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Also, looking for recs for any recent RR stories for Conpetence Porn.
  Ideally Isekai style.


  Best example from current rising stars is Blue Star Enterprise's. That's the exact format I enjoy most :)

  Does anyone have any recommendations for something like Ghost in the Shell? Specifically a story about a small squad in an urban sci-fi  setting (near future/post-apocalyptic) where the action is mostly gunfights. 

  I've also liked Rebuild World manga, but it's focused on the solo protagonist, where as I'd really prefer a group.

  I used to Love HFY, now it's a bit too hard to comb though it to find the gems. Even the majority of featured and must read feels boring.


  Any recs for good stories from that subreddit or with a similar vibes recently?
  ```

  ```
  Looking for recs on superhero stories that are similar to Worm/The Boys/Steelheart.

  Have tried Super Supportive but itâ€™s not my cup of tea.
  ```

- u/Irhien:
  ```
  Are there good reverse portal fantasy stories where the protagonist(s) end up in our world without much magic/supernatural abilities? And their "normal" (not for them) life here is what the story is about?
  ```

- u/ImaginationSome9763:
  ```
  I am looking for a fantasy, or a romance that has a clever, intelligent and witty protagonist! Greatly appreciate all suggestions!
  ```
