  Been following this over on SV, and it is insane in all the best ways. You'll either love it or hate, and you'll know in a dozen paragraphs which is the case. Well worth checking out.

  How much similar is this work to the author's other work, "The Game of Kings"?  I really liked that one.  Nasubabble concentrated to such a point of insanity that it wraps around and becomes sane and consistent on its own terms.

  Edit: Two chapters and I think I am going to like this story also.

      So I've finished reading what you have up so far.  Some additional thoughts:

      We use the property of "Area" as square unit of length because Area correlates with many useful equations and measurements.  If a universe had radically different enough physics that some other more useful analogous property we might use that instead... however you seem to be trying to describe something even more abstract and bizarre... Also, the nonexistence of our integers seems a little bit too weird and out there, basically any event in the story with numerical values is now questionable and likely the result of an unreliable narrator failing to accurately communicate his world.  Also, if causality exists, then succession exists and thus our numbers would at least make sense as ordinals I think even if they have no other relation to universe...

      Some of the weaknesses of TGoK are even more pronounced here for a few reasons... TGoK matches the immensity of its prose with the immensity of the events they describe, even when the sheer complexity of the description of everything gets long and wordy, the epicness of the events going on balances it out and makes it fit.  Here, many events are entirely mundane, if exceedingly eldritch, and as a result the story seems to lose itself at time to the weight of the protagonist's introspection.  I imagine if things pick up in scale this problem will go away...

      Btw, do you know any other stories/fandoms/settings that are similar to your work in their sheer level of introspective and philosphohical depth that borders on purple prose at times... The closest I can think of is some of Dullahan's stuff on nrvsnqr (Maybe I'm a Lion, a KnK fic) and Fallacies' stuff (Sword Vector FSN  and Angel Notes crossover).  You've got me started on rereading these things and I am hoping I can find more similar stuff before I finish my reread.

      Also, if you don't mind me asking and you don't mind answering, how is TGoK progressing?  Not dead, I hope?  Need any brainstorming help or such?  I've never beta'd but I'd be willing to try if it would help your progress...

  Delightful thus far (that's chapter 5 at the moment of writing), although I'm liking the Naruto bits way more than all the higher-level stuff.

  Any special significance to the ç„¡ on the avatar? Aside from the usual koan/unasking the question, I mean. (yes, I know the obvious signalling is unsightly, still couldn't resist showing off)

  EDIT:  
  Just hit the telation bit and I've got to admit: I can't really imagine a universe in which there are recognisable human-like agents and at the same time integer arithmetic is different from the familiar one. I mean, what does it mean for integer arithmetic to be different? Does this mean that ZFC *doesn't work*? First-order logic *doesn't work*? How can a formal system *not work* anyway, isn't it just a bunch of symbols and their relationships? 

  Any universe sufficiently different from ours that familiar formal systems stop working surely would not behave in a superficially familiar way, would it? Perhaps there is some metamathematical insight that'll allow me to break through this confusion? I'd very much like you to share it, if you have it.

  I've got to say though, it's been a while since something sent me on such a wiki spree. I think you've inspired me to finally start learning math again, just so I can express my confusion coherently.

      This correspondence is even more enjoyable than the story itself. Thanks for replying.

      > Well, right now, I'll explicitly state that first-order logic is functional, because for axioms to instantiate any universe with human-like intelligences, it seems to be a hard requirement that rules of inference and decision-making be preserved, and the possibility of first-order logic seems to me to be a hard requirement for that to hold.

      Right, I've been thinking along the same lines myself. I think I can infer that inhabitants of this world are capable of using familiar formal systems. They have a natural language with an alphabet and grammar after all, so the concept of arranging symbols according to rules still works fine. This leads me to believe that ZFC should still behave properly from a purely formal standpoint. And once you define ordinals within ZFC you can extend them to integers and go from there. 

      Now, this itself doesn't mean that the familiar "natural numbers" thus derived actually correspond to the way things behave in this particular natural universe: perhaps there is some magic op, which allows one to divide five apples into three equal groups without splitting any of individual apples into parts at all and at the same time conforms to enough conservation laws that universe doesn't become some eldritch mess incomprehensible to human mind (personally, I wouldn't consider it likely, but what the hell, it's fun to think about anyway). But from a formal standpoint there should still be a familiar theory of numbers in a sense of sentences in a formal language, right?

      I'm really struggling to imagine a world in which formal systems themselves behave differently though. All you have to do is take a bunch of symbols (which don't have to carry any particular meaning at the onset, the important part is the concept of multiple distinguishable things existing) and a bunch of rules about how one can and can't put the symbols together into sentences. That's it, isn't it? The semantic part is more tricky, but I can't imagine formal systems themselves not behaving in a familiar way, at least not in a world where human-like agents exist and use a natural language with comprehensible grammar.

      I'm going to go on reading the story now and see how things develop. Regardless of how it turns out, I respect the attempt to actually make a substantially *different* universe, instead of just putting a new coat of paint over the familiar rules. This has been a pretty unique experience thus far, and the narrative is enjoyable too. Keep up the good work.

  The truth is, integer math is basically counting. If it does not exist, you cannot have any distinguishable concepts in your story. As soon as counting becomes possible, like saying "there are two people, or three people, or twice as many people", then you already have the basic foundation of math in your universe.

  If didn't exist, as in truly exist, then you end with its results being violated. What that means is bringing two people together, counting again, and seeing 3. Or bringing 3 together and having one disappear for no reason. I think it's the most likely that he is subject to a genjutsu or delusion, possibly brought upon him by the other breaker or a ninja in the village. The concepts of integer math are even fundamentally present in human language. You will not escape them while writing your story using the same.


  This is basically a justification for saying " magic!" But it's not a rational one, despite your attempt to present it as such. 

  And thus, I choose to believe that something is still screwing with his head. Who knows, maybe that's just the result of having the residual brain damage from having your memories ripped out and your self fused with another person's whose mind's fundamental structures will not be compatible without some time for adjustment.



  I already started reading this story a while ago, but dropped because it was quite frankly, retarded. Your editing has made it better, but it's still obvious that you intend to use this "foreign" "logic" as a tool to make the story bend to your whims. Because ultimately, if the statements by narrator were true and reliable, nothing in that world is conventionally predictable, and thus not rational because it's claimed to be so Alien as to be non-understandable.

  Here's a comparison: 4-dimensional math is hard to imagine with 3D mindset too, but 3D math is easily imaginable with a 4D one, since it is a subset of the 4D space. Go watch/read flatland if you want to think about that concept more.




  So if you're going to pull the "it was all a dream" card later on, I can only say that I called it.
