  It's a compelling story but deeply non r/rational, i.e. the moral determined how the plot flowed which determined if the technobable worked.

  EY recommended the manga adaptation [back in August 2013](http://hpmor.com/notes/98/).

  This has been available since October, but only recently did the ebook versions appear.

  I read the manga.  I wasn't impressed.  As I understand it, the author took high-level concepts and used them as fodder for new age technobabble, with poorly-understood quantum mechanics acting as plot handwavium. ("I don't have to explain anything.  A quantum did it.")

    As someone who used to believe in New Age pseudoscience, this manga has nothing to do with that. It's still super weird and utilizes quantum phenomena in absurd ways, but I didn't get the impression that the story was intentionally spreading nonsense ideas that it expected to be taken seriously. I think it just uses philosophical discussions related to quantum mechanics to tell a weird sci-fi story, though I thought it started going downhill after the major character death and never finished it.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yup, that was my impression too. I first thought of delaying the read until I understood more of quantum interpretations, but then I said, whatever, I'll enjoy it right now. Given what you said, I don't regret my decision.

  My absolute favorite manga! Would definitely recommend this as at least rat-adjacent fiction.
