  I'm posting this in part because I heard about some people not getting email notifications for the last update.  The text isn't very NSFW, but it's on a NSFW forum, the rest of the story is NSFW, and the page title has \[NSFW\] in it, so I'm marking it with nsfw anyways.

    Thanks for the update, Groon! 

    I'm curious, do you have a schedule for releases, or do you just post them as you write them/when you complete an arc? I've checked in on The Erogamer every few days since the last update but hadn't seen anything about when this release was expected to post. 

    Thank you again!

    Its been posted before and received well. I got mail notifications and am hyped for new content!

    I'm interested in reading this story. Would you be willing to post it somewhere that did not require a log in?

  Thanks for posting this here as well, Groon! I definitely feel it belongs here.

  I'd like to note that the *previous* arc (6.4.2-6.6.d with 6.4.1 serving more as connecting material) not ONLY had a aspiring rationalist character in it, but it explicitly had a reader of rational/rationalist fiction in it -- which uh, may be a global first? Has any other fiction had a rational fiction *reader* as a character in it? :-) I was actually thinking of making a thread here about it, but the new arc beat me to it.

  Anyway Lavelle/Ziquan (character introduced properly in 6.4.2 and being one of the two most prominent characters in the arc) is a reader of HPMOR and makes a couple of references to it, and mentions Unsong as well.

    Might not be canon, but I'm pretty sure Juniper would have read HPMOR and/or Worm.

      He's at least familiar with Fine Structure (one of his campaigns was inspired by it).
      ```

      There are too many Junipers in stuff that appears on this board to allow this without further clarification.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Ha, I meant Juniper Smith from Worth the Candle, who as far as I know is the ur-Juniper from which all other Junipers come.
        ```

        - u/ben_sphynx:
          ```
          I see 2017-07-14 on the first chapter of Worth the Candle.  
          I see August 22, 2014 on the first chapter of The Gods are Bastards.  
          I see March 25, 2015 for the prologue of A Practical Guide to Evil.

          There are probably more Junipers...
          ```

            I stand corrected!
            ```

    ```
    Nothing comes to mind from original fiction, but the fanfic [Sanity Falls](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6040516/chapters/13849945) had a Dipper and Mabel that were both familiar with rationalist work (Dipper explicitly mentions HPMOR).
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Rational Gravity falls? Sounds interesting. Do you think it's good?
      ```

      - u/Badewell:
        ```
        I liked what there was of it. There are only two chapters, and it hasn't updated in years. Dipper is also (intentionally) insufferable, just in case that sort of thing puts you off.

  >*meh* didn't seem like a strong enough word unless you repeated it a half-dozen times.

  MEH MEH MEH MEH MEH MEH.

    I really didnt catch that altough I should have. Nice catch!

        http://unsongbook.com/ by scott of slatestarcodex.com 

        A finished rationalist webfiction that deals with the bible being real. Its hilarious and great and the "half dozen Mehs" play the biggest role in it.

          It's not rationalist, I'm pretty sure. I'm not even sure it's fair to call it "rational". It's definitely rational-adjacent and a rolicking read. As AST says, the right mindset for the kaballah is like a kind of focused schizophrenia, and that's the logic the world runs on.

  this link just leads to a login page for me?

    That's because the story is only available to registered users. I don't usually like registering on websites if I can avoid it, but honestly this story is totally worth it.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Agreed. I really wish it would move to SV but until it does Iâ€™ll continue to log in to read it.
      ```

      - u/ArisKatsaris:
        ```
        I don't know what's weirder:

        (1) you believing it could possibly move to SV (given all its NSFW content that is not remotely allowed in SV)

        or 

        (2) you **wanting** the story to move to that vile bigoted cesspool where all rational fiction is despised fanatically and where every *fan* of rational fiction is called names
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          A) It actually was. I asked about that on the administrative discord, and the directors are fans of it; they consider it to have enough artistic merit to get an exemption under that clause.

          B) It's not. Well, maybe it's because of the banner I have under my name, so I suppose I'm not entirely representative, but it isn't that bad at all. Furthermore, Not all the staff is positive about ratfic in general, but The Erogamer in specific had universal approval from staff and CC. Furthermore, Marked for death is a fairly major thing on SV, and many other, rational adjacent works are very popular as well. I would't say it's anywhere near as supportive of RatFic as here is, but I most of the vitriol that does occur is from a the subset of users that will go into a debate thread about ratfic. It's very much a recipe for sampling bias, because the only people who will be joining such a debate thread are the virulent haters from any population and counterjoiners from ardent defenders, which leaves very little room for conversation.

  For easier introducibility, I really think this should be posted or syndicated somewhere which is not login-walled.

  ```
  That was way better than it had any right to be.
  ```

- u/Beardus_Maximus:
  ```
  I jumped into this late, and I'm having trouble navigating the forum. Is there a way to read the story and skip all the comments? Something available offline would be even better.
  ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    You can click "Threadmarks" > "Reader Mode", and then you'll have just the chapters with none of the intervening discussion. https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/reader

    Or you could just click "\>\>" at the end of each chapter, but make sure it's the "\>\>" of an actual chapter, not the "\>\>" of a stats post, because that would take you to the *next* stats post.

      Your >> arrows were interpreted as markdown, fyi. Use a backslash to escape them.

        Thanks, fixed.

  Is there any way to subscribe to this? I just blazed through the entirety of this in the last two days, and I'd like to know when more comes out

    You can set your QQ account up to email you when there's activity in the thread. I don't think there's any way to get an RSS feed, sorry. 

    I don't think you can restrict it to OP posts or threadmarks, so sometimes it'll email you about discussion. When there's a big gap between updates, the discussion dies down too, so overall it works.
