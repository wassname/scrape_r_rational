## How do you rationally write a character that has to achieve the extraordinary, without resorting to 'Marie Sueness' or pure luck?

### Post:

I've thought about that after reading a review of one of my favorite books ever, Red Rising.  The review is the first one on the Goodreads page if anyone is interested. For those who are unfamiliar with the books, the MC is Darrow, a member of the lowest caste in a future where different color-coded social classes have vastly different predetermined roles in society. The highest one- the Golds, are considered the most superior beings in the hierarchy and can basically treat the lower colors as slaves. They are not only considered the most superior- they actually are as they have access to gene editing and other such technology to gain every advantage.

Comes Darrow, our puny Red. On a mission to topple the **entire** galaxy-spanning social order that's been enforced for centuries by vastly superior and almost godly beings

Now how can he do that, being anything but perfect, or extremely and recurrently lucky?  In the books, this is solved by writing him as a Gary sue- an unparalleled genius amongst the Red, so smart that he can even best the godly Golds.

Thinking about it, It seems to me like the author didn't have much choice in the matter. If He'd written Darrow as a realistically normal incompetent and stupid Red, the critiques would have called out the MC's uselessness, over-reliance on more competent characters, and dumb luck.

What are your possible solutions/thoughts on the matter?

  Some luck will necessarily be involved. But the majority of the unusual-things-have-happened-to-me could be in the form of things that give them opportunities or push them outside of the normal circumstances, rather than giving them direct advantages. What put *this particular* Red on a mission to topple the galactic order? By the time they're on that path they're already unusual. 

  A Mary Sue / Gary Stu is unusual but doesn't struggle at all. Everything is handed to them.

  Don't make their innate capabilities exceptional, or at least don't rely on that. Make their chance circumstances and personal struggles in response to them exceptional.

    There's an old saying (sometimes attributed to Seneca the Younger) that "luck is what happen when preparation intersects with opportunity."

    The gripe about "lucky protagonists" is about individuals who seem to have every opportunity presented to them -- almost as if the universe is bending its shape to suit their needs.  If you want to give your protagonist opportunities without making them seem unfairly cosmically blessed, just make sure it's clear that other people were given these same opportunities, and failed to capitalize on them.  This makes it so that the protagonist's differentiating feature is not that she was blessed with good fortune, but that she had the ability to seize upon an opportunity that others might have missed or ignored or otherwise failed to capitalize on.  The multitudinous ranks of "people who had this opportunity but failed to grasp it" might include past versions of the main character.  It's possible that the main character might encounter an opportunity several times before learning or realizing something that causes them to change their perception and discover the opportunity that was "hiding in plain sight" the whole time.

    If you want to let the main character to succeed at something that nobody else has achieved, one fairly straightforward "hack" is to just make them try harder than anyone else is: having a character win because they tried harder than anyone else often makes us like them more (probably for reasons similar to why some audiences hate "overpowered protagonists" who just immediately win without really having to struggle).  I recently wrote about [the  trope of the enthusiastic neophyte](http://kineticliterature.com/the-master-and-the-apprentice/) who wins through sheer willingness to engage in arduous tasks, which is one example of this.  I think there's some amount of resistance to this within this community, because we like our protagonists to work *smarter*, not *harder*.  Some people are resistant to the idea that brute effort could substitute for domain expertise, and for good reasons: not every problem can be solved by just bashing your head against it. (The solution, I think, is to present your character with the kind of problems that *can* be solved through sheer effort early on, before they've had a chance to accumulate enough domain expertise that they can rely more on competence or "playing the system" rather than just trying really hard.)  We'd all like to "work smarter, not harder," but there's a certain rationality in realizing, "I'm in a situation where I *can't* 'work smarter,' so I guess the most rational thing for me to do right now is roll up my sleeves and work harder until I can navigate myself to a position where I'm able work smarter.  And maybe I'll *keep* working hard even after I get to that point."

    Often, the most successful people tend to be those whose immense effort intersects with immense opportunity.  Taylor Swift was born to affluent parents whose ample financial resources allowed her to travel regularly for vocal and acting lessons, and her mother was willing to fly with her to Nashville (the country music capital of the world) to distribute her demo tapes from a young age. But Taylor Swift is also the kind of girl who, when told by her parents at age 12 that her fingers were too small to play a 12-string guitar, responded by practicing the guitar for four hours a day (six hours a day on weekends) past the point where her fingers were bleeding and calloused.

    While success in the real world is often more than "just try really hard," the more I read biographies of successful musicians, the more I see the common refrain of, "I was willing to practice for 3 hours a day when my peers were only practicing 30 minutes a day, which allowed me to progress in skill more rapidly than anyone else in my cohort." Skill is one of those things that tends to have compounding returns: the person who is the most skilled in their class might catch the eye of the teacher and get extra private lessons, the person who gets private lessons is more likely to get into the more elite music schools, people at the elite music schools get the most elite trainers and often gain connections that allow them to turn pro early, the person who goes pro at an early age is able to devote more time to mastering their craft than an amateur who just practices in their spare time, and so on.  Anyone who understands compound interest and exponential growth knows that over a long enough time horizon, differences in growth rate can outstrip differences in starting principal, and when you're comparing someone who practices 30 hours a week to 30 hours a month, you can get *massive* differences in growth rate.

      The other half of "work smarter" is that the evidence is strong that working harder and persisting is the main key to success. Intelligence which is never applied goes nowhere; persistent effort goes somewhere no matter how it's misdirected. Aim at the right spot then dig in and keep trying, and you have your end result.

    Yeah. Some luck is fine. Encouraged, even. It just has to be moderated and used well. A good protagonist doesn't *rely* on luck, but when they do get a lucky break, they exploit it for all it's worth. That way, one coincidence can snowball into the protagonist saving the day, just by virtue of them using that coincidence well.
    ```

    - u/blindsight:
      ```
      I think the timing of the luck matters a lot for believability. In a lot of stories, the protagonist has plot armor so thick nothing affects them; they brazenly make poor choices then somehow get a lucky break at the end to save them. Blah.

      On the other hand, if the protagonist gets a lucky break at the *start* of an arc, then exploits that luck into advantage, well... That's how life works. It's realistic. 

      Nobody goes into bad situations deliberately expecting it to just work out. That's using luck as plot armor. But everyone has different opportunities presented to them, and most don't even necessarily notice the opportunities they ignore.

        I've been reading a lot of litRPG and quite often it shows how badly an author can handle that single starting lucky break. 

        I've seen protagonists who get some starting advantage and just coast on it without demonstrating any particular brilliance. It's particularly noticeable in this genre because - at least in theory - everyone has access to the same deterministic progression paths.

    This is almost literally how Cradle's main character sets off on his journey. He has an encounter with (someone he considers to be) a divine emissary, and all she gives him is a vision of what will happen if he does nothing, a thing he could do that might maybe change the future, and a marble.

    ideally, these circumstances should seem extraordinary but also \*inevitable\*.  That is, the social and historical climate allowed for this moment to occur - \*someone\* was going to fill that role, this is the story of the person who happened to be in the right place and seize the opportunity.  

    Revolutions occur not because one person has the unique thought to overthrow the social order, they occur because the social order is imbalanced or corrupt in a way that may not be immediately obvious but in hindsight is inevitable.

- u/Weerdo5255:

  Failure, and meaningful failure at that. Multiple times, with consequences that affect the character. You can do everything right, perform every action perfectly, and still fail. Having a character who gets back up and continues after failure will do quite a bit to keep the grounded. 

  In the same vein, compromise. Have a set of values and rules that the character follows, believes in, but then must betray. Batman is an example of this, his fight with the Joker is characterized by the fact he won't kill the deranged clown. That is where most of the angst comes from, Batman could kill him in an instant, the Joker knows it and also knows Batman never will. Establishing a rational character that won't change their rules after failing to get the desired rules with them though, would be difficult.

  I might also consider having a 'foil' as a perspective wtihin the story. It's a little more difficult to pull off switching POV but it will Humanize the enemy and allow for both characters to operate rationally against one another. This does not imply that the enemy / protagonists organizations themselves are rational, so the enemy could be a slaving, racist, misogynist, if that is what their culture produces.

  Such an enemy can rationally say slaves are 'worthless' given their life experience with them. It also allows for logical blind-spots that a protagonist could utilize, like no one of higher status noticing slaves.

  A MC does not also have to be the most 'intelligent' person of a group. Most often they are not, instead having the ability to mesh well enough with all members of it to integrate them, not to mention make snap decisions and be able to trust those beneath the. Decision paralysis is a very, very hard thing for a singular person to bypass when it comes to world / galaxy changing events.  

  I also feel like it should be noted as well, things are hardly ever black and white especially with rational operators. You can have people operate off selfishness and be mercenary with both sides of conflict, you can have people who operate like Doctors without Boarders, or someone who really does wish to watch it all burn. So long as that is established and remains consistent, reasons for the behavior would be nice but not needed so long as their goals remain the same.

    Failure, even in modest amounts, can make "good luck" a lot more plausible.

    One "cheap trick" that you can use to sometimes mask improbable luck is to break a "big break" into a sequence of "smaller breaks."  e.g. if a protagonist has only a 12.5% chance of success, and then succeeds, then it might feel like they got unfairly lucky.  But if a character has a 50% chance of success, and then succeeds, and then repeats this two more times, none of their individual successes seems too unreasonable (after all, they only had to beat 50/50 odds), even though the chance of beating 50/50 odds three times in a row is 12.5%.

    This is a bit of a "trick" that lets you do something rather implausible by masking it somewhat, but you can make it a lot more plausible just by adding one failure to the mix: flipping "heads" 3 times in a row only has a 12.5% chance of happening, but flipping "heads" at least 3 times out of 4 coin flips has a 31.25% chance of happening, which is a level of "luck" that strains our credulity a lot less than if our protagonist *never* loses.

    Letting the protagonist lose every now and then is also important for preserving dramatic tension.  Outside of a quest/RP with an actual dice system, people will generally willing to accept that the real odds will favor our protagonist slightly more often than the stated odds, but if you always "round up" a 50% chance to a 100% chance of success, you'll start to remove any sense of uncertainty from the outcome, and why would someone keep reading if they know exactly what's going to happen every time?  (Even when playing with actual dice, people will probably forgive the DM for a small amount of fudging in the absence of an auditing system for dice rolls.  If you decide to treat a 19 as a natural 20, it will take awhile before people realize that they're getting that extra crit bonus 10% of the time instead of 5% of the time.  The old Fire Emblem games "fudged the numbers" when it came to hit%, but they kept it somewhat plausible by not messing with them *too* much: if the game tells the player that they have a 80% chance to hit, and then changes that to 96% behind the scenes, most players won't notice or complain, and in fact might actually find that the "lying" numbers actually agree with their own mental model more than if the game was being completely honest about the odds: how many people have played a strategy game, seen a 85% hit rate, and mentally rounded that up to, "That's almost a guaranteed hit"?)

  Not all stories can be rewritten as rational fiction, nor should they. If these Golds are orders of magnitude smarter, and have more resources than the MC, then it’s safe to say it’s impossible to write the story, and have the MC succeed in their goals without luck, inconsistencies, and other tropes antithetical to rational writing.

  This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Rational stories are just another genera. A tool to use to write good stories. If you write a good story that isn’t rational, it’s still a good story. 

  As far as making the story you read more rational, there’d first need to be a way to limit how smart the Gold collective is. This can be done in the form of collaboration problems, or short termist leadership policies. Leaders don’t want to make a big deal about an escaped slave, as that may hurt their ability to get re-elected. Also, it’s fairly unlikely the golds actually rule the entire galaxy. Could just be propaganda they feed to their slaves. It may not be worth it to launch invasions of all solar systems, just the more profitable and strategic ones. Basically, to fix the rationality issue, give the enemy, chinks in their armor, which the protagonist can exploit.

  > They are not only considered the most superior- they actually are

  Then a story about beating them is a story that demonstrates how this premise is wrong, right?

  Knowing nothing else about the setting, here are some ways it might be:

  - Superiority isn't a total ordering. Superiority along one measure doesn't imply superiority along another. The measures that have historically been the most important for comparison might not be in the presence of big changes.

  - Even if the individuals are better in every way that matters, their society might not be. Maybe their norms push them to squander their potential.

  - A caste isn't a monolith. Not all members are necessarily working toward continuing their dominance. Maybe they take it for granted. Maybe their attention is directed toward winning zero-sum games amongst themselves.

  - Homogeneity is a structural weakness. If your nation grows crops that are all the same species, your food supply is brittle. Anything affecting that particular crop - weather conditions, pests, illness - will have outsized effects on your food supply. A society strictly ruled by a homogeneous ideology should have similar problems.

  - Being better *on average* doesn't mean every one of these is better than every one of those. If the group with the lower average has higher variance, they will still be well represented among the tails. The top percentile of Xs can be almost all red even if most reds are worse than most golds at X. Maybe nobody invests in training reds because their rigid hierarchy rewards average outcomes more than peak outcomes.

  Build up their track record. Limit their domain, and make them meaningfully struggle outside of this. Have other people on their level out there, even if not in opposition.

  I would compare what things happened historically, but at the end of the day if you do something like that you have to have some sort of sueness involved.

  If you read some biographies of the "great" people of history you'll see that some of it was ridiculous, no flaws, perfect rng. Usually however we know the ending to the story afterwards with history, so Alexander dies early for example, or look at Napoleon.

  Their rise to power and defeating the empire seems like Gary Sue, up until they are actually in power or after they're in power.

  But I don't think any single genius could topple a GALAXY empire without them being a singularity versus say the human bell curve. Just in terms of propagation I struggle to see how an individual human esque figure could emass that much power.

  Revolutions happen certainly, but they don't happen alone or by one individual. See the Great Man Theory of history versus a Marxist understanding of history versus some modern approaches. Again Napoleon is a great example. Certainly the start of Revolutionary France but how much was really him and not all the other people involved?

  Look at the story of Bernadotte for example, randomly elected King of a country he wasn't even part of. If you wrote that in any story people would say this is author bias.

  In my eyes the measure of a Mary Sue is how much the world exists on its own merits apart from the Mary Sue - it's a quality of the world and the overall approach of the story, not the specific character or their specific plot.

  A Mary Sue will be surrounded by people who are defined in relation to the Mary Sue (increasing in one-dimensionality the more Suey the story) and the story and world will also be defined in relation to the Mary Sue.  This leads to the consequences of 'everyone loves Mary Sue' or 'Mary Sue never needs to struggle' because that's the most common way it manifests, but it's also why you can't avoid making a Mary Sue by just having some people dislike the Sue or by making them dramatically struggle at certain points.  It's at the end about how robust your world is, how much your characters are real people instead of cardboard cutouts and how much the setting is a world with rich history and rational actors instead of a stage prepared solely to give the Sue powerups and stuff.

  The flipside of this is that you can have a character who is beloved and does not struggle without making them a Mary Sue, as long as you make the world and characters robust despite this (OPM comes to mind for the second factor).  Relevant to your circumstances, it's perfectly acceptable to make the MC exceptionally powerful and/or lucky, as long as you don't break suspension of disbelief.  Notably, when you are setting up a story's premise you have a lot of flexibility to set up *one* strange thing.  It's sort of the principle that this strange thing is why this protagonist is worth paying attention to in the first place, as compared to every powerless wannabe revolutionary who just dies instead of accomplishing anything.

  So, for instance, if your story is about a powerless rebel who has a magic sword fall out of the sky in front of him, and the sword makes it impossible for him to lose a fight, that hasn't made him a Gary Stu.  It's contrived, but the premise of a story is allowed a contrivance.  The measure of whether he'll be a Gary Stu or not is what he does with the sword, how his friends and companions behave, and how the world behaves in response to him.

  On the luck side of things, a favoured strategy is prophecy.  This kid isn't just some clever lad, he's the *prophesied hero*.  Events contrive in his favour because the hand of Fate is on his side, and even though he looks like the luckiest guy ever we can know that it's not implausible.  I personally don't like the Fate play for other reasons, but if all you want is to give him the opportunity to be truly exceptional without breaking SoD then some IC-explained plot armor is a perfectly viable way of doing it.

  Some initial author fiat is permitted. Think of it as a survivorship bias serving the narrative. I haven't read the book you're mentioning, but I assume there are billions of reds, and none of them too happy about the current order. So there are millions or billions of reds striving to change their dole, right? But most of their stories are not interesting, because they fail and fail again (or die as a result of a first/second failure). For the story to be interesting the author must invent a red that gets some special advantage over other boring reds. Of course, there are limits how much you can give initially, and you can't give out more fiat just to bail the protag out in the middle of the story.

  The general answer to the problem is that engaging writing can be summarized with the word BUT. The protagonist must never get a decisive victory in any act leading up to the finale (and probably in the finale as well). There's always a complication, or several, leading to further escalation. The first group of mooks is defeated BUT one of them escapes and reinforcements are coming. Or, the protag gets a full tactical victory BUT at a very high moral cost (i.e. all hostages killed). The Sue (Stu) doesn't have a good, concise definition, but as a rule of thumb Sues don't get these BUTs. They are over-competent and morally superior at the same time.

For example that story you just mentioned, i haven't read it, but can you imagine if the MC one day found out that the adminstration/government had direct control over everyones color and they could change that any moment they wanted to?

  Prefacing this by saying that I haven't read the novel, or the Goodreads review.

  In these scenarios, superfuturistic spacefaring societies you can't topple regimes by punching them into submission - unless we're talking deliberately overplayed things like WH 40k, or run of the mill bad writing. Also, with the exception of *extremely* authoritarian powers or truly henious poverty, access to some Internet - like information network should be at least plausible (not necessarily easy).

  The MC is already driven, this we already know. For whatever reason they want the system to crash and burn, or be replaced or whatever. With access to information and your standard package of Main Character's luck ™, you already got yourself a fairly good coctel to shake things up.

  It's a matter depending on setting and the flavor you wanna give to the protagonist. Is booming the economy feasible? Maybe terrorist attacks? Guerrilla tactics, cut supply lines to cities/countries/planets? Collaborating with the underworld? The possibilities are not few, what has to remain true is the core of a sufficiently inteligent character (doesn't have to be a genius, acknowledging your limits and grabbing yourself a brainy sidekick would also work) who is driven and can access valuable information.

    It's been ages since i read it, but iirc he doesn't completely overthrow the social order, but he rises in political and military status and ends up throwing a coup with the backing of various groups that would benefit from a change in leadership and sympathetic ears to leave the caste system in place but removes a lot of the coercive elements of it and allow a little more social mobility instead of absolute slavery for the reds.

    Then there's a second trilogy that i haven't read that seems to follow with him dealing with the fact that all the golds are still around, still rich, and still scheming, and trying to turn his new social order to their advantage at his cost.

  The godly gold class MUST have flaws. One possible flaw they could have is overconformity. If everyone can gene edit themselves to be "perfect" what defintion of perfection are they using? Chances are certain genes will become more trendy and popular than others either due to government edict or due to gold class votes. If everyone in the gold class is constantly conforming to their rigid social order they would likely have difficulty with thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to novel problems. If everyone around you seems perfect at everything they do, there isnt much incentive to actualy put in an effort, so that creates laziness. Plus they have the other colors to do their work for them. The golds would be stagnating, in other words. They wouldnt strive to become all they could be and they wouldnt have the incentive to try. A red class person would not have that disadvantage.

  Also, there's another risk to genetic overconformity: monocropping means that if one specimen is vulnerable to a particular disease, they ALL are. So if they encounter a novel disease they arent familiar with, the golds all get wiped out pretty easily. Unless they stop with bioengineering themselves and get robot bodies, and that would come with its own problems.

  In this particular case, I'd look at a number of possible approaches.

  A classic one is that there's some new factor which appears, and the protagonist is just the one who rides the wave of change. It might be as esoteric as aliens turning up; it might be as prosaic as the Golds expanding their territory just a tiny bit too much to be able to hold onto it with their usual methods. Or it might be that a Red stumbles on something which changes their status (directly or indirectly).

  Another one is that the protagonist effectively rides a short-circuit of changes which have been building up since before they came on the scene. If there have been secret groups of people looking to overthrow the Golds, for example, then the protagonist potentially has access to resources which aren't necessarily obvious just from looking at the surface of the society.

  Some of it can be made more plausible by having it be logical outcomes of other people's plans. Perhaps there's a Gold who wants to disrupt society in some way to gain an enormous amount more personal power, and a deliberate aspect of that is giving the protagonist (and possibly others) access to things they wouldn't normally have, or arranging a string of what looks like strokes of luck. The story can be expanded in the second and third act by revealing this. Perhaps they want the protagonist (or several people) in a particular position, or perhaps they're going to use them as a scapegoat, or as a rallying point, or a false flag, or something of that nature.

  A variant, combining the puppet-master and the unlikely opportunity, is there being a super-scientist who has the absolute latest in super-gene-editing tech or similar, and for some reason wants to stick it to the Golds, so they pick a Red and use it on them. Or maybe the Red is just a random experimental subject. Or gets lumped with the tech through some mishap.

  There can also be aspects of the protagonist's "luck" being due to the way society is actually set up. If they get Gold-level access to things, for example, then perhaps all non-Gold people will refuse to believe the protagonist is not a Gold, because they've been raised/brainwashed into obeying all Golds absolutely. Or maybe the computer systems have no protections against a 'false' Gold, because there's been no need for such protections for centuries.

  Their superiority is strictly physical and social in nature. I don't think the series ever mentions mental enhancements. They also seem to have a socialized weakness of a nearly psychotic devotion to competition, infighting, and one on one duels in power armor. Darrow is basically able to recruit anyone with a smidgen of conscience for the price of asking. This lets him become the sole pupil of the single greatest warrior in living memory.

  In the same vein of the Golds being stupidly adversarial because they are in love with the image of being hard men making hard decisions, they genetically engineered super soldiers and proceeded to enslave them all with a mix of lies, threats, and superstition rather than genuine loyalty.

  But yeah, Darrow is a Gary Stu. I love the series, but far from being a critique of hard men making hard decisions, it's the story of the hardest one of all, who is given a moral justification in order to keep him at all sympathetic.

  I don't think writing with the reception in mind will do you any favors.  Like, any time you are 'against' your audience stuff gets weird.  Writing is hard enough, if you are like 'I want the character to accomplish X but I have to make it clear that they aren't unrealistically gifted AND I have to make it clear that they acknowledge the role of fortune in their...' you are gonna go nuts.

  I mean, if you are pro, you are singing for your supper, that's a whole different deal.  I don't know anything about that.  But if you are just writing web fiction then my advice would be not to beat yourself up about it.  Write what you want, and if people call it a Mary Sue, just do more writing.  People are gonna say stuff no matter what you write, might as well make yourself happy.

  I think you're depicting a mistaken account of what a Mary Sue is. A Mary Sue is what occurs when the reader gets annoyed at the character and author because the narrative is clearly pushing an agenda that the reader feels is annoyingly self congratulatory or fanning the author's ego in some way.

  The  "[Albert Einstein Humiliates an Atheist Professor](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-einstein-humiliates-professor/)" meme is a Mary Sue. What you'll notice is that although the author wishes to portray the protagonist as exemplary, in reality there actually are *no*  exemplary characters in the story. Nobody in the story is admirable- the whole thing is mocked because of the clear wish-fulfillment agenda of the author.

  Writing a truly exemplary character - a character we *actually* aspire to be ... rather than just someone the author *wishes* people would look up to - would make your story truly exemplary.

  And of course, one person's exemplar can be another person's Mary Sue - often happens when the reader and the author do not share a worldview and value system.
