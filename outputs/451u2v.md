  Inside the Box.  With half a dozen supervillains, lots of history, hats, and the oddest word I've ever used to start a conversation with a stranger.  And a cliffhanger.  And mice.

    Obligatory, question is obligatory: I'd like to have this all in one file.  I use text to speech where I don't have pod-casts or audio-books while coding  to help in the flow state and after >1. year the lack of inflection doesn't matter.  Do you mind if I collect a personal copy of the volume?  (I will be buying a hardback to put next to my hardback of [Unicorn Jelly](http://www.lulu.com/shop/jennifer-diane-reitz/unicorn-jelly/hardcover/product-1435783.html) when it comes out and would at least contribute to the Patreon for an assassination that could be causally linked to an audio-book or fan-cast.) Before you answer, alternately what does your copyright lawyer,or sufficiently dillegent research say?
