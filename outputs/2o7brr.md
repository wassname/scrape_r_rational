  I'm surprised at how mundane Suze has been acting the past two days, and that Herr√∫n took all that time to just go talk to her about basic godhood rules. Given Loki can just generate the full library of all knowledge about the gods at will, and given the senior magicians of Flobovia were similarly capable of implanting rulebooks into Jake's head, should Suze even need someone to tell her explicitly?

  I don't know how much I should expect of eaglejarl, so for now, I'll just stick to noticing I'm confused.

    The Archmagi's summoning ritual didn't create information, it took all the written information within the summoning circle, burned it, and implanted the contents in Jake's head. It was effectively a reversed Scholar's Touch spell -- it let him memorize the written information very quickly. 

    Loki created a set of books containing things that he knew. He's a lesser God so his power is limited, but he's a very old and clever God, so he's had a long time to learn stuff. 

    Suze doesn't have the knowledge to start and is currently facing unknown unknowns -- she doesn't know what she should be asking. She's also been a little busy these past few days flexing her newly divine muscles to really sit down and think through the implications. 

    There's a little more to it, but I'll stop there.
