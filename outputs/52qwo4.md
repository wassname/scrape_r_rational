## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  A common feature of cyberpunk stories is to feature corporations in positions of power equal or greater than that of governments in developed nations. The simultaneously best and worst example of this trope is Shadowrun, where the Supreme Court granted megacorporations the same rights as sovereign nations, which I frankly find absurd even if it does a good job at justifying the dystopia. So I tried to think of a way to make the shift in the definition of business a bit less absurd, and I think I found the answer with superheroes.

  In the setting I've come up with, all sources of superpowers require substantial infrastructure to produce and maintain, so large corporations are the only ones who can create them. However, new anti-trust laws and military treaties heavily regulate the usage of powers, so companies are severely limited in how they can profit from them. The only loophole is for when powers are used to be a good samaritan, so they decide to create superheroes and pass them off as a form of charitable donation.

  The heroes end up being a huge success, and soon develop a celebrity culture around them and their exploits. The companies recognize a marketing opportunity and become sponsors of people that fight crime and save lives on TV. This is what causes a shift in the idea of what a corporation is. Suddenly, businesses are no longer just out for themselves, they are spending money solely to support the actions of real-life Supermen and using that money to hold them to high standards of behavior.

  The appearance of supervillains backed by organized crime, which the police can't handle do to a a backlash against militarization, finally cements corporations as responsible protectors in the public consciousness. The brands people buy and work for become a mark of identity as much as the heroes themselves, and the companies that support those heroes are swimming in cash as they promote the image of responsible capitalism. Businesses begin internal crackdowns on abuses of power, even publicizing arrests of their own executives to prove their integrity.

  Soon there are calls to loosen superpower laws and even deregulate other industries, and the liberals capitulate because the system does seem to be working. With the majority of corporate income now coming from what are basically taxes on customers, they begin building new subsidiaries to supplement public institutions as a way to further compete over PR. A few public controversies later, and people are demanding for-profit organizations be granted new legal protections from the tyranny of ideologues.

  Where the typical cyberpunk megacorp comes into effect is that companies are more obsessed with their public image than actual business. They've taken every step they can to avoid or discourage accountability while also trying to slander each other, so private investigation and espionage is now an industry in and of itself. Workers and customers are also encouraged to become cogs in a machine while innovation has been stifled by a new kind of monopoly. The glitterati cape culture is social satire that writes itself.

    Was it inspired by Tiger&Bunny or Ratman? Also how do powers work in your setting?

      I've heard of stories where superheroes are celebrities, but never read/seen any, but I am familiar with stories where characters' special abilities require infrastructure to support them, like Ghost in the Shell. I want to leave the mechanics of powers open to whoever decides to use this setting, I'm no writer, so I just imagine the world having as much weirdness as any superhero comic.

        Ah, I asked because I am worldbuilding [a very similar setting](http://imgur.com/gallery/H3kK9), so I was curious what were your inspirations.

        BTW have you checked /r/worldbuilding?

  I've got a story idea.

  In my world, there is an Eldritch Abomination at large in the ocean, every person is aware of its existence. In fact the biggest tragedy of the world had happened only because humans had attempted to kill it once. The disaster was so big that it had killed off 80 percent of the entire population and sent a civilization on the cusp of the Singularity back to the medieval ages, technology wise.

  Modern technology still exists but is treated as artifacts of an arrogant culture that didn't know its place. There are churches of said Abomination.

  And there are a group of people that believe that the abomination was sent to halt the development of the human race because somewhere, something was *scared*.

  Obviously I need to hammer out the details and stuff but I think the premise needs some tweaking before that. 

  Edit: The majority is heavily indoctrinated by the abomination's worshippers from childhood.

    > In my world, there is an Eldritch Abomination at large in the ocean, every person is aware of its existence. In fact the biggest tragedy of the world had happened only because humans had attempted to kill it once. The disaster was...

    Honestly everything from this point forwards seems to deviate from the core of the setting.

    Do you want the major source of conflict to be the discussion between allowing the Eldritch Abomination to roam freely(with occasional high number casualties I expect), versus trying to destroy it when the retaliation potential is far too big? Or is it about pulling out a twist to surprise the reader?

    Because if you reveal the truth in the status quo on the beginning(like you did here) then the reader will be slogging through descriptions of the society that do not address the main problem. If you pull it somewhere along the 2nd act, then it's sort of only a grimdark twist "if you try and kill it, 80% of the world will die like once before" isn't as impressive as it sounds in story terms because it's such a huge impact that it loses all meaning, you can get the same effect by scaling it to a nuclear explosion level of destruction of a single city for instance.

    Also, this might be because I've been reading [Shamus Young's Final Fantasy X retrospective lately](http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=32341), but it really reminds me of its themes? It's not necessarily bad, just a point of comparison to keep in mind.

    There isn't a compelling set up for conflict. We have a sort of Luddite establishment and a creature that will kill people if you poke it, and that's about it. It could work as background for a fantasy setting, but it sounds a little too straightforward to me.

  So I like some ideas from Naruto and want to homebrew a setting that has those ideas but not some of the other ones.

  The ideas I love in Naruto:

  >3rd generation warfare in a medieval setting. You have small highly trained armies like in the modern world.

  >Jinchuriku are human atomic bombs.

  > Intelligent ninja animals.

  >Lot of throwable weapons. The fights in general are close and personal, not the bullets from 500m away like in modern times.

  >Clans and a highly devolped biology understanding.

  Things I hate:
  > Shonen power levels. Tailed beast should be the most powerful unstopable thing around. No exceptions.

  >We have electricity and computers but still use knives to kill each other. 

  So let's make a working setting out of it.

  My ideas so far:

  >Normal word with humans

  >Thousands of years ago 9 tailed beasts appear. They are natural disasters that sleep for decades and then go on short rampages destroying everything they see. When they are tired rampaging they find a baby human and go sleep inside him. This baby human become a Jinchuriku. He now has a chakra sytem and a nearly unlimited chakra reserve. If jinchuriku is hurt of seriously enraged the biju awakens (partialy  or totaly) and tries to eleminate the disturbance (sometime along with the city he is in) and go back to sleep.

  >Jinchuriku descendants have also a chakra system but a more limited chakra reserve. This is how ninjas were born. 

  >Each Jinchuriku is particular and his descendants show variations in chakra systems creating a clan.

  >This coninued for many years until 1500 years ago a great disaster wrecked humanity. In this adverse condition life was hard and many normal human died while the ones with chakra system survived.

  >In current day 20% of population have a chakra system. Of those around 3% are from clans. The other are descendants of long forgotten clans. [spoiler]The disaster was introduced to explain how in such a short time a large fraction of population obtained the chakra system[/spoiler]

  >In the last  century many clans united in city states and created Hidden villages as we know them today.

  >Currently they are at peace as all have jinchuriku and a MAD scenary is very likely. A common use of Jinchuriku in wars was smuggling him in the enemy city and then pocking him until biju awakesn and destroy the enemy city. Also using a jinchuriku this way makes biju go to sleep on enemy territory and basicaly gives the enemy a new Jinchuriku. This offers intresting warfare tactics.

    I have never seen Naruto, but I have an idea of how handle the intelligent animals that could also explain the unusual mix of technology. If there are at least some animals that can communicate with humans, they've no doubt voiced their grievances over our effect on their environment. As a resolution to a Princess Mononoke-esque conflict, there is an international accord restricting the use of industrial technology. It's been in place for so long, though, that reverence for nature has become part of culture and spiritual practice.

    This means that post-medieval technology can exist, but the infrastructure necessary to produce it is rare since you need to reach an agreement with the animals before you build it. Even something as simple as a mine requires a lengthy process of ritual negotiation until the animals grant you access to their territory. Hunting is usually allowed, but restricted. Both humans and animals have rights to defend their territory from intruders, but pursuit or retaliation is forbidden unless they are acting at the behest of their social group.

  On a note from a conversation with /u/GabeRocking, what are some of the more obnoxious premises for stories?

  Trekie already mentioned one, the evil corporation premise, and that one bothers me a lot, but another one that annoys me a bit more, is the "radioactive spider" premise of spider man.  Not that the spider gives magical powers, but that the company wouldn't realize it works on real people at some point down the line.
  ```

  - u/trekie140:
    ```
    It actually does make sense in the original comic. The spider was irradiated by accident during a demonstration of some science device, without being noticed because it was so small, and then it bit a bystander in the back row who ran out of the building. A lot of superhero origins work the same way, it was just an accident that the company couldn't have foreseen and doesn't know occurred so they don't try to repeat it. Even in cases where the company does know it happened, they event is such a fluke it can't be repeated.
    ```
