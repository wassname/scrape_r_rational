  It's a nice story but I fail to see how it is rationalist. If the devil had lived for millennia and made multiple mistakes, surely he would lie more effectively. There is a danger that Mr. Murphy would meet the Chaplain or any doctor (who would tell them that soul cancer does not exist). He would have restricted Mr. Murphy's movement more to prevent this. This can't be the first time he tried and failed to trick someone into signing a contract in a similar situation. And why not delegate to a demon or use demonic help in other ways? I'm confused.
