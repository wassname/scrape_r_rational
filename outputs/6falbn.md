- u/Quetzhal:
  ```
  I'm concerned with Zorian's attitude towards his simulacrums. Not only is he starting to treat them like tools rather than people - he's also broken the rule about letting them last for more than a day. At this rate, he'll eventually get truly defiant simulacrums.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    He decided a while ago that they were behaving well enough to be allowed to live longer, starting with the scout who visited Koth.
    ```

    - u/Quetzhal:
      ```
      Well, yes, but now he's insulting them and demeaning them. If he lets himself continue with that attitude, there's a chance they'll decide to rebel.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        > If he lets himself continue with that attitude.

        Quite.

        It's all the more foolish since they are recently-diverged copies of himself, so we can reasonably suppose that the original would have done exactly what he is now berating the copy for. If he wants his copies to act differently, then he'd better look inward and make some changes to the template.
        ```

        - u/Vakuza:
          ```
          It also seems completely out of character for Zorian to act like that at all... For me it makes the chapter feel rather weak compared the the rest.
          ```

          - u/thrawnca:
            ```
            Nah, he's always been impatient and irritable. Just look at how he responded to the mandatory dance in chapters 3 and 4. He may have improved, but he's still Zorian.
            ```

            - u/Vakuza:
              ```
              That's not the thing though, the simulacrum just saved Tavien and Zorian responded so aggressively​ without much reason. I can see him being telling the simulacrum to hurry up and be more conservative with mana, but shouting at it and calling it stupid? Seems a little off from the Zorian who usually internally complains, and seldom by demeaning others unless it's warranted.
              ```

                > Seems a little off from the Zorian who usually internally complains, and seldom by demeaning others

                Maybe this is his new version of "internal" complaining?
                ```

                  ```
                  Yeah, I can see this. Zorian's surliness is very similar to my own, and I can see myself yelling a a simulacra in the same way if I was under as much stress as Zorian was at the time (under attack, plan not going to spec, close friend about to be murdered, etc). It's basically externalized self-criticism, because I'd damn well be yelling at myself inside my head just as much as I'm yelling in my head at my simulacra.
                  ```

- u/AmeteurOpinions:
  ```
  We finally see what it looks like to create a simulacrum, and spend more time with their short little lives. It wasn't always clear if the original or the copy was narrating, though.

  Also, tearing the gate out of the ground, lol. That's one way to do it. I wonder what would happen if you put it inside the Orb Palace.

      - u/None:
        ```
        To be fair, those portals just pop on moving (in terms of their planet as reference)
        ```

        - u/Kuratius:
          ```
          Actually, there is a level in Portal 2 that has a moving portal. Checkmate.
          ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  So. There is a way to persuade the Ibasans to abort.

  The real world just became possible after all.

  OTOH, we haven't finished the iteration yet.
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    'Persuade' seems like not the best word for that. Beating them, that's more like it. But yeah, gotta wait until the restart and then there's always the fact that in the real world everything will be different due to spirit realm being functional.

      - u/HeroOfOldIron:
        ```
        Well depending on exactly how the Sovereign Gate works, Red Robe could actually be walking away from it while the remaining loops go on. If Z&Z make it out, they'll have a chance to ambush him while he thinks he's completely alone and already won.
        ```

        - u/HPMOR_fan:
          ```
          I assume it would work by replacing the original souls with souls from the Sovereign Gate. So wherever their bodies were in the real world when the Gate was activated, that's where they would be when they get out. Except that some time has passed in the real world. Probably not much, seconds, minutes, hours? If RR's soul was replaced sooner he could do something like walk away, or kill Zach. We know too little about the pre-loop situation though. Zorian would be in his bed but we don't know whether RR entered with Zach or found out about the loop when he was inside. We don't even know if Zach had to be present at the Gate to enter it. Maybe it's tied to Zach's bloodline and RR activated it. Since Zach wakes up in his bed each loop it implies that's where Zach was. Or maybe he gets to choose a starting location when activating the Gate?
          ```

          - u/FlameSparks:
            ```
            I would guess seconds, minutes at the most, as the time RR has spent out of the loop is a small fraction compared to the life time Zach has spent in the loop so you have to multiply that time by at least 5 for the time the time loop takes in the RL.

            Just had a thought. There is a few hours between where Zorian wakes up and the loop starts, found when the Aranean were soul erased from the loop, that could be a buffer period for when the projected time estimate of when the loop starts and ends in the real world ... potentially.
            ```

          - u/serge_cell:
            ```
            I don't think there is any soul replacement going on. In real life all the simulation happens in some very short (quantum scale?) interval of time. The soul just stop interact with real life at the start of the interval, experience complete simulation timeline and start interact with real life again.  Red Robe early exit would not be noticeable.
            ```

            - u/HPMOR_fan:
              ```
              Actually I thought the soul exchange part was told to them by the Gate spirit guy.

              Edit: Yea, here is from Chapter 55. 

              > "Because only the Controller has their real soul pulled into the time loop," the Guardian said. "Everyone else is a copy. For a Controller of the loop to leave, I only have to re-anchor their soul back to their original body. For one of the copies to enter the real world, I would have to switch their soul with the soul of the original. This would effectively kill the original."
              ```

              - u/Nic_Cage_DM:
                ```
                So Zorian and whoever the other non-Controller is (probably RR) are both copies. Maybe they could soul-meld the copies with the originals to get around having to kill them?
                ```

  - u/Laser68:
    ```
    Maybe, real world they can bolster their forces with the local areana, but they might have a lot more trouble recruiting helpers given they are no longer in a loop, and their confirm-able proofs wont work anymore. Plus I assume there was a lot of losses involved. xvim will be harder to convince without the spiritual plane being cut off, and i am not sure how easy it would be to convince into actually spending resources on it without xvim to help allay his fears.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > I assume there was a lot of losses involved.

      Sure, but their whole strike force only included a few hundred sapients. If the invasion actually goes ahead, that many would likely die just in the opening artillery barrage.

      > "their confirm-able proofs wont work anymore."

      Um...if we're talking about eradicating *an underground base full of Ibasan invaders and a dimensional gate*, then somehow I think it won't be hard to find sufficient evidence.
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        Don't forget about the library of books that Xvim is getting transferred every restart. He would probably quickly realize the veracity of Zorian's claims.
        ```

      - u/Laser68:
        ```
        True. I am not fully convinced they would not be able to dredge up the same amount of support in the real world. I am however skeptical that they could do it as easily, and that they would be willing to do it. Sacrificing people if they are already doomed to die is one thing, but actually setting up an assault in the real world would be a much more impactful undertaking. That said, this was not a mission to stop the invasion or minimize casualties, so it would probably be much easier if that was their goal from the start.
        ```

        - u/ddaonica:
          ```
          You say that, but very very few of the force that assaulted the Ibasan base knew about the time loop. All those forces were making this assault thinking they would die.

          And with Zorian's memory books of Xvim and knowledge of Alanic i'm sure he would be able to convince them again (without the cutting of the spiritual plain) and i'm sure they'd think 50 deaths is worth stopping a whole invasion...

          In fact, knowing that all it takes is destroying the dimensional gate to stop the invasion, i'm pretty sure Zorian and Zach can spend a good few cycles finding out how to convince more officials of the threat, so that they could basically send an army to the base, or even a way to stealth destroy it?
          ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Don't forget that if the invasion really *is* canceled, not just rearranged, then ZZ are likely to keep doing this every loop so they can refine it. Being able to reliably shut down the invasion would be a major step forward.
          ```

          - u/Laser68:
            ```
            That is a bad idea, the areana being still alive, and red robe being an active element means refining invasion counters is a waste of time. Like they can refine their stealing the gate for study, but refining a tactic for use in the real world is not something they have the time for, nor would it be reliable.
            ```

            - u/thrawnca:
              ```
              > not something they have the time for, nor would it be reliable

              What's the alternative use of their time? Zach tried to fight the invasion head-on for *decades* without success, and that's without summoned demons being added to the mix. Sure, there are missing factors here, but it seems like repeated gate theft attempts have pretty good payoff. If they can identify all the priority targets, find good counters to the anti-aranea wards, etc, then even with further complications in the real world, they might have a chance to nip the invasion in the bud. And that's worth a whole lot of effort.

              (And they want to steal the gate for research, anyway; if they can make that theft more efficient and take it with the portal still open, great!)
              ```

          - u/ddaonica:
            ```
            Red Robe currently throws that plan into the wind. For that tactic to work they need to figure out exactly who Red Robe is and where they start the cycles, and then essentially eliminate Red Robe the moment real life starts.

            Also they won't ever be able to practice exactly how it will play out in the real world due to the absence of the Cyorian Aranae.
            ```

- u/Laser68:
  ```
  Some interesting stuff. I feel like they should try and deal with silverlake soon, that or try to find more keys. Poor Taiven.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Taiven survived AFAICT...although she would have been rather upset by watching Zorian get blown to bits. And then mad at the original, most likely, for letting her worry like that.
    ```

    - u/Laser68:
      ```
      Well ya, it was more a trauma pity then oh shes dead.
      ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      Tavien is in limbo until further notice about her, but as she's quite capable she should have been able to get away yes but we simply do not know.

      but yea she'll probably chew him out as long as she's fine.
      ```

- u/DocAutomata:
  ```
  Ever since they were introduced, I've been kind of uncomfortable with how the characters view simulacra, so I'm hoping this incident with Taiven brings up the moral issues surrounding them. Given her views on the timeloop, I can totally see her getting angry at Zorian for completely dismissing his simulacrum's "sacrifice".
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Considering the loop slaughters people by the billions, her point would be pretty weak.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    She wouldn't know that he mentally yelled at his simulacrum. She might even be touched that he sent someone to help rescue her (although she wouldn't want to admit to needing help). But she will be mad, because he let her think he was really there and caused her to fight on unnecessarily.
    ```

    - u/DocAutomata:
      ```
      When I say "dismissing his sacrifice", I'm envisioning a scenario where Taiven is at first relieved, and then horrified when Zorian explains the mechanics of simulacra (if she doesn't already know them) in the most flippant way possible. Simulacrum or not, she still saw a sapient being with its own separate experiences die for her, and it probably wouldn't help that said being was for the most part identical to someone she cares for.
      ```

- u/HotDropMarble:
  ```
  I can't wait to see how this loop ends since there won't be an invasion, which is a first.

  Also, did Taiven just die? It sounded like she was by herself after the simulacrum popped...
  ```

  - u/-Fender-:
    ```
    I think that she knows how to teleport, so she may have gotten away. On a side note, the trauma of seeing Zorian die might be enough to convince Taiven to declare her love to the original, if she does feel that way. I think that that was the reason why nobody103 included the scene in the first place: to be able to make more character development for her.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      > I think that that was the reason why nobody103 included the scene in the first place

      Actually he's made it clear before that he doesn't plan to write romance, because it's hard to do well.

      Taiven hitting Zorian for being an idiot and scaring her, on the other hand - that I can see happening.
      ```

      - u/-Fender-:
        ```
        And we already got a declaration of love from Akoja. What's another one? Not like Zorian would be able to do much about it while he's still stuck in the loop, anyhow. But it might affect the endgame, when he's out of the loop. Just like his meetings with Raynie convinced him to try to befriend her once he's outside.
        ```

  - u/HPMOR_fan:
    ```
    I have a hunch that Ichl will investigate how this happened. Just this chapter it mentioned he is one of the only threats to Z&Z.

    RR and Ichl had a deal where RR would provide him info. I wonder if that deal was made before the time loop started or after. If it was before, Ichl might suspect it's related to RR in some way. Otherwise he could just track down Alanic as an organizer of the raid and learn about the loop from him.

    Edit. Ichl may also want to get his gate back or destroy it. He's getting his forces out to make the defenders feel relaxed, then strike where they have the gate.
    ```

- u/aeschenkarnos:
  ```
  Zorian needs to start making his simulcra with numbers on their foreheads. (Because as with the old story about the three pigs released in the rival fraternity labelled #1, #2 and #4, the enemy will waste a lot of time looking for the missing numbers.)
  ```

- u/cjet79:
  ```
  So stealing the gate cancelled the invasion, but it wasn't *just* stealing the gate. The way they stole the gate told the Ibasans a few things:

  1. Plans of the invasion are likely leaked. No more surprise attack.
  2. Someone had enough knowledge of their base to come in with a strike group and steal a portal. What more might this group know?
  3. (Ibasans might not figure this out) The raiding group had enough knowledge of the Ibasans internal structure that they knew who to kill to prevent the calling of the Lich, and they knew the Lich was involved.
  4. The Ibasans just lost a bunch of officers and trusted subordinates. Sure, they could probably still pull off the invasion, but losing a bunch of trusted and competent personel is going to set them back.
  5. Finally, we don't know how the gates work. It might be that the Ibasans are now worried about a counter invasion if they continue to leave their gates open and active.

  Overall I don't think it would have the same effect on the invasion, if Z&Z just snuck into the base and quietly sabotaged the portal.

A part of me scoffs at this, dismissing it as simple cowardice, but there is another part of me that can't help but wonder whether the time loop had eroded away my ability to recognize what is and is not appropriately cautious behavior. What if we manage to leave the time loop and deal with Red Robe, only to die two months later because we did something completely stupid out of sheer habit?"

  >The projectile slammed into the wall of the building and then burst into crescent spatial distortions that sliced through everything in the vicinity with no visible resistance. The whole heavily warded building fell apart like an apple thrown into an industrial blender machine, burying everyone in it under several tons of rubble.

  This is an impressive spell. It's small and quick to cast, but it ignores a heavy warding scheme and uses spacial distortion to destroy an entire building. I wonder why we haven't seen him cast this before? It would have been nice against that hydra or Quatach'Ichl.

    the Lich can just tp away, it will not hit just like he does with any other threatening spell he just tanks the ones he know he can take.

    the hydra have a simular problem, we don't know how easy the dimension cutter is to dodge or how volatile it is, if it activate on touching anything the hydra can just spit poison breath to stop it for example.

  - u/None:
    ```
    Zach also has a frankly ludicrous repetoire. It's possible that we haven't seen it before because it simply didn't occur to him. Maybe it was something he learned a while ago, that's quite tricky to cast exactly right, so he'd been practicing it off-screen.
    ```

    - u/warsage:
      ```
      > Zach also has a frankly ludicrous repetoire

      I can't wait to find out why he has so much mana capacity. What does Zach say early on? That magnitude 60 is an exceptionally high capacity, but that Zach is 243? Yeah, something happened to give him that much power.

      They talk about it again in the black box when Zach mentions that his shaping skills are much better than they should have been for someone with such high capacity.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I'm not talking about his mana capacity, I'm talking about the sheer volume of spells he knows. He might not be an archmage per se, but he is practiced in the use of a large variety of stunningly complicated and esoteric spells, so long as those spells can be used to cause massive damage.

      Can you imagine performing hundreds of simulacrums and never teleporting inside the mind of one?

      - u/Lybile:

        I perfectly understood your point, my argument is that he did not say it first degree but second, just as a joke. Which is why i pointed out that Zorian is smart and as such able to emotionnaly dissociate himself from the situation. It's kind of like an abstract mathematical problem, you do not necessarily visualize it but can still resolve it. He doesn't feel simulacrum yet can imagine what he would have said if he was a full-fledged one.
