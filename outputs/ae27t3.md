## Rational Star Wars?

### Post:

For all the lurking I've done on this sub I'm surprised I never heard of any Star Wars rational fic. The potential for this should be enormous!

For exemple it would be insanely interesting to follow the story of a rational Sith (whether he/she studies the Force or just wants to take over), or a rational Jedi (struggling with keeping balance or not falling to the dark side etc) or even non-Force users for once. I'm really curious where this would go.

If there ARE such fanfictions please do recommend me some- or all of them.

EDIT: thanks for all the replies, never got that much karma before :D

  Some fics:

  - The Son of Suns trilogy, which is an AU where Vader captures Luke at Cloud City, and the Emperor raises Luke as his newest apprentice. This series is comparable to *Worm* in terms of torture and brainfucking of characters. Comes in three separate works:
      1. [Into the Storm](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4302076/1/Into-the-Storm)
      2. [In Shadows and Darkness](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4344112/1/In-Shadows-and-Darkness)
      3. [At the Brink of the Dawn and the Darkness](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4520729/1/At-the-Brink-of-the-Dawn-and-the-Darkness)
  - [The Trial of Darth Vader](https://archiveofourown.org/works/4121383/chapters/9290023), where Vader survived Episode VI as the Rebellion's prisoner.
  - [Random Headcanon](https://prokopetz.tumblr.com/post/152005706762/random-headcanon-owing-to-differences-in-certain) about why Star Wars' worldbuilding feels off. I'm not going to spoil it here; it's a short thing. But I'll add my own conclusions: The Empire never developed radar, and there's atmosphere in space.

        Man, I always find those political opinion pieces about Star Wars so bizarre. The guy actually \*praises\* the new trilogy for having black-and-white morality and villains with no discernible motivation. I actually thought the weakest part of the new movies was how I still have no idea what made Kylo Ren or Snoke or even Hux do any of the things they did.

        If it's the story I'm thinking of, that I read a while ago (Emperor tortures Luke and turns him), it doesn't particularly emphasize intellectual problems and solutions IIRC

        > Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

        Not more than any other story.

        > Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

        Yes, definitely, but that's just good writing.

        > Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

        Not really.

        > Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.

        No.

        > Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.
        > 

        Yes, to the extent it can, though it's set in the SW universe, which certainly doesn't abide by this rule.

          Yes, it's probably the story you're thinking of.

          Sure, it's not rationalist fiction, but I thought it satisfied all the other criteria.

  rational? space opera often is not, even if specific characters may be. 

  I tend to see the jedi/sith divide as being a flase dichotomy. the force is not just two conflicting groups and their ideologies, those are just the two we see in the films. sith want control at any cost, and are sociopaths at best, psychopaths at worst. the jedi were an order that refused all emotion out of fear, and cut off all emotional contact out of fear. fear of the dark side, of the sith, of losing control.
  ```

  - u/boomfarmer:
    ```
    Pretty sure I've read someone's Star Wars headcanon that had examined the Force in light of modern statistical parables: there are only 0, 1, or infinity of things, not two. The Force does not have infinite sides; it does not have zero sides. Therefore, it must have one side. And based on observations of Force weilders, it's a continuum from being immune to the Force to being the worst of the Sith, and Jedi are only an emotions slip away from becoming more-adept Force users. There is no Light Side to the Force; there is only the Dark Side, which the Jedi skim.

      Do thing and anti-thing not figure into that somehow? Acid and base, positive and negative? It seems to me that opposites are fairly common phenomena, but I'm not a scientist (nor a statistician).

        He's misremembering the quote a bit:

        >Zero, one and infinity are the only numbers that need no justification

        is the actual quote. I'd say phenomena that come in sets of two do need a justification for why exactly two although in many cases the justification is easy to do.

      - u/Hust91:
        ```
        I think that is more in the sense of "more or less of 1 thing".

        Could acids and bases not just be seen as more or less acidity?
        ```

        - u/vimefer:
          ```
          pH is a ratio of relative concentrations of hydronium and hydroxyde ions that form spontaneously in water. Acid and base don't have absolute definitions, anything can be an acid to something and a base to something else.
          ```

        - u/turtleswamp:
          ```
          Acid/base is a poor example, but positive and negative charge is a better one.

          &#x200B;

          If the force worked like charge then people who try to balance dark and light end up with week or no force power, those who exclusively use dark Xor light get stronger but only in the direction of the one they use. And reversing course would directly weaken them until they cross the neutral line. 

          &#x200B;

          Further if the reflect vs cancel behavior is relevant it may explain why a week light side user can benefit from using the dark side when fighting a strong dark side user. They don't have enough light charge to cancel the stronger dark side user's charge, but even a small dark side charge will repel their charge rather efficiently. While in the long run this brings their total charge closer to neutral (or even to net-dark) in the moment it can mean surviving an otehrwise hopeless fight.

          &#x200B;

          Technically you could argue that this is an "infinity" case as there are infinite distinct charge levels between negative infinity and positive infinity. However that's kind of missing the point which is that when two charges interact it matters what combination of positive and or negative they are at least as much as it matters what they respective magitudes are.
          ```

    - u/Radix2309:
      ```
      This seems based on a flawed understanding of the force. It isn't really divided into 2 halves.

      There is the Force, and then the dark side which is corrupted. The Dark Side has a tangible impact that can be felt, and is distinct from sacred force areas. Places like the cave on dagobah or Sith shrines. 

      Philosophically the force is about being in harmony with the world around you. The Dark Side is like a ripple in the pond when you try to bend it to your will. This creates a corruption that expands as you continue to feed it.

      There can be things of 2 as long as they are justified.
      ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    The idea is that the Force itself pushes certain behaviours. If you start "going Dark", it exerts a corrupting influence. I liked Eliezer's idea (posted below) because really there doesn't seem to be such a feedback mechanism for Jedi: they are simply trying their hardest NOT to fall for the Dark Side, *all the time*. The Sith are the ones that stopped bothering.

    If I wrote a rational fic about Star Wars, I guess "destroying the Force" might be the ultimate objective. It really seems like it's more harm than good. At the very least, it's a semi-sentient force of nature that likes screwing around with human affairs.
    ```

- u/BigBeautifulEyes:
  ```
  The problem is the Dark Side doesn't make any sense.

  They don't seem inherently more powerful then a light side user.

  The only advantage they seem to have is lightning coming from their hands, which is easily deflected/absorbed by a lightsaber, "Don't throw your lightsaber away Luke you dumbass!"

  So it just seems to be a belief that your more powerful, as well as other massive personality changes.
  ```

  - u/turtleswamp:
    ```
    A possible rationalization of the Dark side (also the Jedi prophecy about Anikan, and the rule of 2).

    &#x200B;

    Premis: The Light and Dark sides are not opposites. The cycle of life and death, and the balance of opposing forces is the Light side. This balance is the "natural" state of the Force. And Light side users learn how to maintain that balance when they interact with the force. The Dark side, is a 'corruption' of that whereby the force user doesn't bother maintaining the balance. The result is easer access to flashy effects and exclusive access to some things that require not "balancing the equation" like eternal life.

    &#x200B;

    The ethical issue with using the dark side is that the force does still have to balance at the large scale. So the Dark side is essentially imposing a large externality on the force as a whole. For every dark side user living forever the life of every other living this is shortened slightly to make up for it. Similarly any dark side technique creates local disruptions in the force that have to be smoothed out at the cost of spreading them across the whole of the universe. This is what ultimately creates the seemingly random regions that are "strong with the dark side".

    &#x200B;

    The temptation of the Dark side is that it's easy. Any trained force user can just stop worrying about the balance thing and get an immediate boost in power, and a force user learning for the dark side for the first time has less to learn. It is also a gateway to the ever tempting eternal life. The problem with using it is that it's a tragedy of the commons. The more dark side users there are the shittier the force as a whole gets from the lack of matiannce, and at some point it even starts to backfire on the Dark side users themselves. 

    &#x200B;

    So, The Jedi interpreted the "bring balance to the force" line in Anikan's prophecy to mean "cut all that Dark side nonsense out for good" because the "imbalance" is the existence of the dark side. The Sith have the rule of two, because the fewer dark side users there are the less work using the dark side is. And the Dark side continues to be tempting because it's a shortcut, with no obvious down sides if you're the only one doing it, plus eternal life.
    ```

    - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
      ```
      This isn't just a rationalization, it's literally what the Force is according to Lucas.

      The Dark Side is a perversion of the Force. Not an opposite of the "light side".
      ```

      - u/turtleswamp:
        ```
        Yeah, I got the idea from vaguely remembering he said something like that.

        However, that never actually appears anywhere in the canon, and Disney holds the reigns now so Lucas lost his chance to make it canon. Most people think the force is a Yin/Yan deal, and some stuff from rebels and Last Jedi reenforces that.
        ```

  - u/DerTrickIstZuAtmen:

    In my perception 'the dark side' was always a parabel of 
    [With Great Power Comes Great Insanity ](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WithGreatPowerComesGreatInsanity), with the risk increasing the more someone opens themselves to the ~~magic~~ Force. The Sith even encourage letting your emotions rule. Psychosis can be pretty emotional.
    ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    > They don't seem inherently more powerful then a light side user.

    One Sith somehow manages to hold at bay multiple Jedi. Consider this: Palpatine might be an equal with someone like Yoda or Mace Windu, but he completely slaughters less skilled Jedis in almost no time. So perhaps he was never that talented to begin with, and the Dark Side automatically makes you the best possible Force user?

    That said, it's still not much. But if we hold to the idea of the old Expanded Universe of Palpatine keeping a mental hold over *the entire Empire*, that's released upon his death, well, that is *some* power.
    ```

    - u/kraryal:
      ```
      To support your point, Yoda is nine hundred years old and has been a Jedi almost that entire time. Palpatine is roughly an equal with him, with what? Forty years of experience or so. That's a big boost.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        True, though Mace Windu would too have a comparable period of experience as Palpatine, or even less. In fact according to this logic, if the universe has races as long lived as Yoda's, and if ability with the Force depends more on knowledge and mental clarity than outright physical prowess, all the top Force users should be incredibly old. A human could never hope to reach those heights with such a puny lifespan. 

        On the other hand, every Jedi in the Temple has had many chances to train by sparring with other Jedi, and has fought many battles on the ground against multiple weaker enemies. Palpatine has had forty years to... huh... train with whoever his master was, kill his master (probably in his sleep, if it was Darth Plagueis), train alone, maybe spar a bit with his own disciples such as Darth Maul and Dooku. That's it. The rest of it, he had to pretend to be a honest Naboo politician so he didn't really get much time to train at all.

        Yeah, I'd say a "Dark Side boost" is a thing.

  Not a rat-fic, but an actual published Star Wars pastiche that rationalizes the two sides of the force is the Mageworld books by Debra Doyle ([https://www.goodreads.com/series/53631-mageworlds](https://www.goodreads.com/series/53631-mageworlds))
