  Great chapter! The Animorphs have leveled up to the point of having a space fleet. I'm not convinced the Visser doesn't have his own secret ability to self-destruct all the ships at the flick of a switch or something - otherwise why let the Animorphs take them so easily - but at least the Animorphs get to feel like they're doing something.

  I would guess that the Visser specifically constructed a clone emissary with tweaked values optimized for negotiating with the Animorphs. Assuming he had time to do this after Telor landed their blow, that is. (The fact that he seems to be able to control so many new bodies suggests he does have copies lying around). I love the interactions with the Visser in this chapter.

  \>  Where do *wants* come from?Â  What are they made of?Â  How do you change them? 

  I would love it if the Visser were actually sincere here, since this seems to leave open the possibility of him being redeemed by, say, using his biotech to explicitly change his own values. But currently I do not trust him one bit. Even if he follows through on his promise to leave humanity alone with the cube, are the Animorphs really prepared to let him take over the rest of the galaxy for himself? What kind of a future for humanity is that, trapped in one solar system surrounded by copies of a greedy alien psychopath?

  And we've yet to hear from Tobias and his trump card Puppyship. (Or to figure out what the deal with Rachel is, or what the deal with the apparent time travel is).

  So all in all, I'm very excited! Keep it up, TK17!

    I don't think he'd be willing to modify himself like that. We know he's single-mindedly, pathologically focused on the preservation of his self, to the point where he would execute his own clones upon waking them up if their perspective had drifted too far from his own. I think he would view changing his own mind like that as being too much like death for him to go through with it, especially if he was modifying himself in such a way that he was less devoted to his goal of beating death.
    ```

    - u/Quibbloboy:
      ```
      Yeah.

      He spent pretty much an entire chapter one time explicitly pondering the issue of *value drift*, and how best to avoid it; he seems to consider it a fate as bad as (or *worse* than) death. I'd be enormously suspicious if he even LOOKED like he was considering that to be an option.
      ```

      - u/Evan_Th:
        ```
        Yeah.  I think he's sincerely thinking about values here, but he's not actually considering changing his.
        ```

    - u/FenrirW0lf:
      ```
      I think he'd also be worried about any overly modified self somehow gaining an upper hand and outcompeting all of his unmodified selves. He wouldn't want to risk potentially creating a new ally for the Animorphs that doesn't share all of his values.
      ```

    That would be one hell of a twist if the POV of V3 noticing he's a single entity now is actually the POV of someone who's been set up as a clone. With the original V3 happy little Alloran-Esplin marriage still being out there pulling the strings.  
    Though.... that clone just being made to negotiate with the Animorphs doesn't make sense, as we see him neutron-bombing the West. \[unless that V3 made another clone, but.... eh\]

    Though it would be hilarious if Marco or Garret thinks of this possibility (whether it's true or not) and V3 freaking out, because this hasn't occured to him yet.

  I like how they just bluffed their way into having total command of an entire fleet. There are times when they all just feel like teenagers frantically running around and pretending they can make a difference while the world crumbles around them, and then there are times where they do shit like *that*. It feels really good that this chapter spent most of it feeling like the first way, only to end on that note. It reminds you that they do have a lot of things going for them, that they *can* make a difference, that there *is* hope, even if it usually doesn't feel that way.

  It worries me a lot that we had that interlude earlier about where the Crayak put the Drode in as a helpfile.  The Visser is much more of a glove than it thinks it is, and I'm concerned that notion is bleeding over to our crew.

  The pieces go back in the box once the game is over, no matter who wins.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    By Drode do you mean Howlers?  I haven't referenced the Drode yet, but V3 got access to Howler DNA.
    ```

    - u/WalterTFD:
      ```
      Ah, my bad, I was thinking of the thing it added in Interlude 13.  Somehow I'd gotten it into my head that that was the Drode, being used as a helpfile to guide the hacking efforts, really/not really as a way for one of the players to steer V more directly.

  Great chapter <3

  Just noticed I don't really have a model of Yerk command structure. Are pools given an allocation of ranks that they fill as they see fit, or do Vissers and such have relatively enduring personalities? I guess Yerk society is changing, becoming more individual based with the greater availability of hosts and ways of feeding outside of the sharing.


  Oh no, Jake invoked the unspoken plan guarantee.

  I always think this stories at it's best for me when the Animorphs are talking things over with multiple threads going at once in thoughtspeak, so yay for more of that.

  Ooo, and Marco got with Rachel, I'd forgotten that he was interested in her. Yay for them!

  Also not sure why Garret thought Ante should have gone first in the role call. Maybe for alphabetical order reasons, but the rest weren't quite in alphabetical order anyway.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    "Ante" is a prefix meaning "before."  =P

    - u/Dick_Hammond:
      ```
      Haha,  went right over my head
      ```

- u/DavidGretzschel:
  ```
  Yes! Garrett came up with the same solution, I did (eventually).

  If V3 is honest about wanting to only be a leet Hyperhacker, why not ask to help with that and stay in the loop, not giving up control of the cube! \[though knowing as a reader about how absurdly smart V3 is, they likely have not much to contribute, unless Quadruple-Marco scales similarly to Esplin-Alloran in the brains-department\]Also Rachel and Marco are cute. And Rachel made a good, very concise point.

  " *Actually,* whispered a cold, indifferent voice in the back of my head, *he killed* Jakeâ€™s *mom and dad.*Â  You *never* had *parents."* ðŸ‘»

  I have no idea how the fleet takeover is supposed to work exactly. And half the time, I thought they were talking about Europe the continent instead of Europa the moon, because in German Europe is called Europa, but that's on me.

    You're right from a strategic perspective, but also note that he's fourteen.

    He's good at *understanding* other people, which doesn't automatically translate to being good at manipulating them.
    ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  As if we need further evidence that the Animorphs and V3 are being manipulated into conflict, consider how much easier it would be for them to take this deal if they hadn't all personally lost people to the war already.

  V3 is right in hammering home the earlygame-midgame-endgame point. When you're waging war, unless extermination of all enemies is your goal, there's always a balance to be struck in killing as many of the enemy as possible in the hopes that you cripple their ability to resist and they'll surrender sooner, without doing something so horrendous that you just strengthen their resolve to fight longer.

  Earth would never surrender itself to an alien that didn't demonstrate the ability to rain hell down on it. So, once subtle takeover was no longer possible, V3 had to rain hell down on it. Wiping out a small city wouldn't really matter to the people in charge of getting the nations of earth to surrender; it would normally just be a demonstration of power, a way to say Take Me Seriously.

  But instead, enslaving and killing the people of Ventura in specific also made it that much more likely that the Animorphs (who by fate are the most agenty Earthlings) would feel *personally invested* in stopping and killing V3, making even good deals like this one seem that much more unpalatable.

  I also really like Jake pointing out that V3 having "got got" might have been enough to change his strategy and goals. V3 is pathologically against any form of value drift or change, but that doesn't mean he's incapable of *learning* or *updating on new realities,* which means when he found himself facing enemies that actually needed to be taken seriously, he also might have to legitimately compromise.

  That doesn't mean he won't grab a new advantage that has no costs if he can, of course. But his offer seems credible, to me, especially with a leeran being used beforehand (normally I'd say V3 could just send a copy of himself that genuinely believes in the deal while another version of himself intends betrayal, but the way he's set things up I'm not sure if that would count as too unaligned a V3 to tolerate).
  ```

    > (who by fate are the most agenty Earthlings)

    There's also the fact that interacting with the fleet at all was *only* possible thanks to Ax's cradle; Yeerk cloaking tech is sufficient to cloak ships from other Yeerk ships, meaning that even Earth-built Bug fighters hanging out by Europa wouldn't have been able to find/see the cloaked fleet.
    ```

  >â€¹Okay, that was fucking amazing.â€º

  Yes. It was.
  ```

- u/PretentiousSmirk:
  ```
  I love V3 in this chapter. I get the feeling he really does want peace in the short term at least, but that doesn't stop him from seeking out an advantage in the morph cube. Very much in line with what he was saying about chess strategy earlier.

  Hey, Jake did the Perdao infestation! Although that was very...uneventful, compared to how Tiyagi experienced it. There's a few ways I interpret that:

  - It seems consensual infestation is no-big-deal compared to unconsensual (ex Tobias with Temrash). 

  - Jake's been through so much shit that infestation trauma doesn't even phase him.

  I'm curious, Perdao is a fairly large Yeerk in terms of mass compared to Visser 1/4 and Maninho. She's also bigger than Temrash which I'm assuming is about average size for total human control. Did she leave parts of herself back in Ax's brain when infesting humans? Seems kinda like an Esplin situation here, more Yeerk than necessary for the host brain.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    She's only very slightly larger than Temrash, who was a normal human-takeover Yeerk.  Maninho is like the human version of Temrash/PerdÃ£o relative to an Andalite brain.  Visser 1/4 is smaller than that.

    It depends a lot on how lit-fic you want to get, and how much you want to read between the lines, but I like to think that Jake very much *was* traumatized by it, and is just straight-up ruthlessly suppressing it and thinking about it **not at all** because he doesn't have any spare resources to deal with it.

    This isn't evident anywhere in the text, but it's *compatible* with the text and it's my headcanon as author.
    ```

    - u/KnickersInAKnit:
      ```
      I had to go back and check:

      > There was an echoing sensation, as if of laughter.  â€¹Not Temrash,â€º corrected the Yeerk.  â€¹PerdÃ£o, of the first pool of Terra.  Though half of Temrash three-one-three makes up nearly half of me.â€º

      Ah, so Perdao's like 110% of Temrash's size. Ok, I'm curious now. How much did Cirran overshoot by when it made Esplin for Alloran?

      Yeah, I would agree that Jake being hella traumatized and ignoring it isn't evident to me from reading the text. But it'd be interesting to see if/how that trauma manifests itself down the line. Maybe if faced with another NEED-THE-INFO situation Jake might not ask that of Perdao again.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        I haven't sat down and done the math on, like, estimated cranial space or whatever, for Andalites, but my rough guess has always been "they put in 3x more Yeerk than they needed, for an Andalite, which is already close to 2x what's needed for a human."
        ```

        - u/KnickersInAKnit:
          ```
          Holy shit poor Alloran didn't stand a chance
          ```
