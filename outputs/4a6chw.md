  ```
  A couple chapters ago we saw Rob in the races.  Now it's time for the fights.  The very dangerous, very 'bloody', fights.

  welp

  [Speculation/wishful thinking](#s "Rob gets rebuilt and surprisingly turns out his consciousness is retained from earlier even though it shouldn't because of magic stuff")

  If this doesn't happen I'll be extremely sad, I cried when [Spoiler from To The Stars](#s "Clarisse, who too is an AI, came back with her previous consciousness").

  I guess I have an emotional thing for badass AIs
