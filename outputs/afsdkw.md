  YESSSSSSSSS

  Best quote:

  "Given Catherine’s continued absence, I imagine an amount of brutal murder was involved"
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Lines like this puzzle me. Characters keep depicting Catherine as brutal... and yet she lives on the same continent as Warlock, who blew up an entire city and everyone in it, goblins, who skin their enemies alive to send a message, dread emperors, who have a room full of screaming tortured heads, Masego, who kills anyone who tries to talk to him, Hasenbach, whose brilliant plans include "trap Black in a non-evacuated city so the terrified civilians keep his troops in place while they burn alive".

    Catherine is incredibly tame in comparison.

      ```
      Saliency bias, you do a few public brutal things and it gets associated with you disproportionately
      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:
        ```
        Like goblinfire in the first few books. Speaking of which, this fancy new alliance may pay dividends there.
        ```

    - u/Banarok:

      i don't disagree.

      However it's probably about expectation, if you expect someone to murder you sadistically and eat your children, then you dont call them brutal, you'll call them goblins, basically their name means they are expected to be.

      The black knight i don't think is known for being brutal but for being efficent, at least the current iteration, and the squire not probably either since they can go either way, both white and black.

      so if you don't expect someone to do something brutal it sticks to memory more then goblins being goblins.

      It's the difference between drone strikes and executions in embassies.

  I've been waiting for the Battle of Princes' Graveyard since book four started.

    Oh, yes, that looks like it. Hopefully she'll reuntie with the Legions first, because I doubt general Rumena managed to drill the sigils into a proper army while they were marching through Arcadia.

  I love that this chapter is this picture in word form:

  Yes! It's back!

  They have a sense of humor!

    Yeah, I've been missing my tri-weekly fix, too.

  It's funny how the news about Catherine is so outdated. Nobody knew she went to the Drow?

  How would the Dead King react to Catherine rejecting/losing apotheosis?

      Followed by disappointment, dismissal, then murder.

    - u/RynnisOne:

      That's certainly my reaction to it.

      Seems the whole story did a 180-degree reversal toward the end of the Drow arc.  Writer seemed to balk at the slavery thing (even though it wasn't even close) and wanted her to get her 'humanity' back for some reason.  The main character is *all about* self-mutilation to achieve her goals, it's just weird seeing her go on about being 'gloriously mortal' and giving up all that after the journey we went through.
      ```

      - u/Jangri-:
        ```
        I think, the quote of Masego is relevant here - "To think like a god is therefore to be a god". Cat has been slipping away from herself, without realasing it, and I think even us as readers didn't really notice it because the change is so gradual.

        Then however, once she loses winter, the contrast is sharp and she realises how far gone she truly was. I think Warlock was right in a sense when he said Catherine died at second liese.

  ```
  Catharine is finally whole as a villain, for at last she found ~~Jesus~~ The Gods Bellow.
  ```

  - u/Rice_22:
    ```
    She is finally the practical Guide to Evil.

  Can someone give me a quick rundown on this piece?
  ```

  - u/Rice_22:
    ```
    A story about Good vs Evil in which almost every major character is medium-aware and use it to their advantage.
    ```

  - u/M3mentoMori:
    ```
    On the chapter, or the story as a whole?
    ```

    - u/Matija_Saljic:
      ```
      The story as a whole please
      Didnt manage to find a good summary or plot description on the site
      ```

      - u/lolbifrons:
        ```
        A young, cynical orphan girl is approached by the most dangerous and Evil man in the entire Dread Empire.  She becomes his apprentice to help the Kingdom he helped to subjugate.

        Also everything is governed, in-universe, by narrative logic, and the orphan girl's main advantage is that she's exceptionally genre savvy.

        But whatever impression you got from my shitty summary, it's better than that.

        Also if you're a fan of heroic banter, you've never heard villainous banter.

          Holy shit that sounds amazing, I've only read HPMoR and one of my favourite elements was the genre savvy of Harry, looking forward to reading it
          ```

          - u/tavitavarus:
            ```
            Whatever you do, don't start with Book 5. It would require a lot of explaining to understand the conflicts that have been building since the first book.
            ```

            - u/Matija_Saljic:
              ```
              I think its counterintuitive to start with anything other that the beginning itself
              ```

          Thank you for this description. I've never been able to describe PGTE adequately enough when trying to get my friends to read it!
          ```

- u/Morghus:
  ```
  I found the last part the best. The image it invoked in my head was reminiscent of every badass from a starcraft marine to the Lady, to the evil Queen to Morgoth's armies marching out of Angband

  >Somewhere in eastern Iserre

  I thought she'd be going somewhere in the north to fight the Dead King, but since shes in eastern issere it looks like shes going to take a swing at that creepy Tyrant.
