    > On the other hand, I really disliked the main character. She had almost no agency whatsoever and as far as I could tell never made an effort to learn anything about her new world. Immortality was wasted on her.

    I hear you on this, but that's sort what I was going for. Not unlikabiility per se, but definitely a lack of agency. There are moments of agency, like going to a butcher's and getting some animal blood, but they're shut down. Or, like the proposal to go public, just languish somewhere in the head office for twenty years. Or, like running away, are ultimately countered.

    Consider it a meditation on working in corporate culture, if that helps. It's possible that I might have been able to make her more likeable (but still ultimately without agency) by showing her working within the system more, coming up with clever stories and false evidence to mask the tracks of the vampires or something like that. I think maybe I leaned a little too far in the direction of powerlessness. Or maybe reading a story about a powerless person having what little agency they possessed forcibly removed by circumstances beyond their control is just never going to be entertaining.

  This story is mostly about how you keep a masquerade going and probably has a few clever bits that you'd enjoy. It's 15K words, which isn't even novella length, so you can probably get through it pretty quickly (yes, I know most people on this sub like things measured in gigawords).

  I'm curious how there are eleven separate bloodlines. 

  Also, I've been kicking around this idea that it would be hilarious if there were a whole bunch of magical masquerades hidden from the world *and from each other*, and eventually a couple of them bump into each other.

    All eleven descend from a common progenitor. At a certain point, they decided that it was far too dangerous to just have the father of all vampires walking around, so they ganged up on him and stuck him in a hole with no light or sound, force-fed blood once every twenty-four hours like clockwork, since this is safer than having him moving about. This is a closely guarded secret that I couldn't work into the story.

    I've been kicking around a similar idea! I'd be interested to see how you develop it, and would be willing to have ideas bounced off of me.

      Some day I'll get around to writing the story where the masquerade is mostly enacted by the population that is not "in the know". Certain knowledge is discouraged because ultimately it's about as dangerous as a tank full of small pox virus (visible volume of actual virii protein) wrapped around a tube of nitroglicerin when it gets inside your head.

      the individuals that survive such knowledge end up as some flavor of supernatural.

  This story kind of reminds me of Daybreakers, which had a similar concept to the ending (vampires ruling the world). There's very little in the way of fiction about vampires ruling the world, and I think the concept could be further explored. I would love to see a sequel to this story!

  And that, kids, is why you don't try to shoot super-fast monsters with semi-automatic handguns. A C4 charge in a wooden box would have been a much more serious threat.

  Also, grenade launchers. Like any self-respecting monster, vampires have three weaknesses: sunlight, wood, and grenade launchers.
