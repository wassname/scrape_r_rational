  So some of you may remember this survey from just over two years ago (It was posted on Jan 9, 2015). About 500/2050 members submitted at that time. Since then, we've grown from about 2,050 members to a little over 6,500. Plus we've all aged two years! So i decided to redo the survey for the lulz!

  I've made it a little bit more complex than last time. Before, the survey took like 5 seconds. Now it may take 15-60, depending on how hard you wanna think about it. It's all completely as anonymous as you want it to be; feel free to comment and, as I did last time, I'll post the link to the results spreadsheet if this idea gains traction! The old data is there too, for anyone curious.

    Might the additional complexity impose a (marginally) higher entry cost to participating in the survey?

      Maaaaaybe, but it seems like people in the rationalist community enjoy taking long surveys, if previous surveys are anything to go by.

  I'm sad that I can no longer (honestly) put "Less than 18 years old" as my age.

    ```
    Well, my great-grandmother told me "better old than dead" and so far she's been right!
    ```

  The comments are few and far between (as expected) but they range from amusing to downright odd. I'll be posting the spreadsheet link later tonight most likely. It will be view only but of course you can download it and do what you like. 

  Edit: I also screwed myself by making the favorite question cheekboxes over multiple choice bubbles but I can salvage this! Minor changes to the form have occurred (commas have been replaced with hyphens) as a result!
