  I've been checking out some of the new rising stuff on RR, and I was pleasantly surprised by [Weeaboo's Unfortunate Isekai: The Necromancer's Gacha](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/83045/weeaboos-unfortunate-isekai-the-necromancers-gacha) by Warby Piscus (To The Far Shore, Slumrat Rising). Despite the degenerate sounding name, this one is more horror than harem.

  It reminds me a lot of [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that), a deeply troubled but fundamentally caring individual finds himself thrust into a vicious setting, and the stories he uncovers give him a heavy hatred toward the creators of the setting.
  ```

  - u/Naitra:
    ```
    All of Warby's works are total bangers. This one looks good so far, but I'm a bit worried that the setting is too game-like. I think things would've worked better if the setting was more realistic.
    ```

    - u/CatInAPot:
      ```
      Not my favorite setting of all time or anything, but I think the game setting adds a good amount of existential horror to the story. Like the fact that time doesn't move unless you use a "turn" giving orders, knowing you can't beat a wave, how long can you endure a confined space that doesn't change, with no entertainment, and dolls for companions before accepting a grotesque and humiliating death?

      Patreon spoilers: >!Versai's uncle who figured out that he has some leeway to communicate despite his forced service as a hostile NPC by monologuing during a "cutscene" was very cool.!<

      Idk, to the far shore and the banking one were great, TOP TIER.  Slumrat was just boring OP cliche, and Weeaboo seems to be readable so far while still fitting the tastes of the larger demographic Slumrat attracted., fitting in-between.
      ```

  - u/Dragfie:
    ```
    It's pretty good, only thing that turns me off is the protagonists constant complaints about the morality of the setting comes off a bit too much like "oh no I feel so bad I have all these slave girls under my control, I'm not totally not enjoying it or trying to give the reader an excuse to enjoy their fantasy!"

    Nothing wrong with a bit of wish fulfillment but complaints from our mc who then participates anyway really turns me off. Just own it lol.
    ```

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      There should be a trope name for that. "Pandering to the censor", perhaps?
      ```

    - u/CatInAPot:
      ```
      I'm a little confused by what you mean. The MC is put into a world where he can't hold a weapon, can't leave his tower, and will die a horrific death if the monsters reach him. He's especially disgusted that some of the golem things that are his only recourse look like little girls. How is he supposed to not participate? Just accept death?

      At least personally I feel like the story did an admirable job of making the whole thing unsexy despite the premise, perhaps I just missed it. Giving scouting/building commands to something capable of like two lines of dialogue doesn't appeal to me personally.
      ```

      - u/Dragfie:
        ```
        Ah its more of an Author criticism than a character one:

        A good example is the trope of slaves in Isekais (japanese ones in this case), for some reason every MC is both against slavery, and gets hot female slaves, and they apparently like being slaves.
        There's nothing wrong with that in itself, but I personally dislike when the author tries too hard to justify the fantasy in-world, and in this case the constant "woe is me" from the protagonist about the slave girls just makes me roll my eyes and feel the desperation of the author to not feel guilty about his fantasies XD

        We have some sick fantasies... own it not try and moralise it through a proxy.
        ```

        - u/CatInAPot:
          ```
          For me, the fact that everyone, even the MC was put into some sort of artificial meat-doll body missing most bodily functions makes it feel more like a grotesque parody than anything actually titillating.

          I see where you're coming from though, I share the opinion on shows like Rising of the Shield Hero or whatever. I will say the fact that the summons are exclusively cute girls so far is a negative point I'd give the story, though simply because I find it boring variety-wise.
          ```

          - u/Dragfie:
            ```
            Nah, summons only being girls, being super hot, by circumstance completely infatuated with our MC is totally a selling point. I just don't like the compaining about it XD

            If anything shield hero is better than the others, because the MC isn't justifying his actions but just doing it.

            My point is porn is porn, calling it anything else is just cringe, but there's nothing wrong with enjoying a bit of porn.
            ```

              ```
              The 1 stars can't speak beyond a couple lines. Versai, the most sentient among them killed a previous tower master for trying to do stuff to the dolls, and has a policy of not getting attached because she expects tower masters to die very quickly. 

              Obeying combat commands and saying "yes commander" does not imply anything approaching infatuation. I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree on how sexy it is, we clearly have very different interpretations of the story
              ```

              - u/Dragfie:
                ```
                >The 1 stars can't speak beyond a couple lines.

                What, like every character in every gatcha game? And people play gatcha with hot anime girls in it because of the plot right?

                >Versai, the most sentient among them killed a previous tower master for trying to do stuff to the dolls, and has a policy of not getting attached because she expects tower masters to die very quickly.

                So? How does that impact her sexual appeal? In fact it raises it (by doing exactly what I am complaining about earlier) by excusing her servile position (she isn't REALLY a slave) and highlighting how special our MC self-insert is (she's never liked another guy like she does him, he (read: the reader) is special \*wink\*) the MC literally can't go a paragraph without stating how hot she is.

                >Obeying combat commands and saying "yes commander" does not imply anything approaching infatuation.Â 

                Sure, not yet, but I'll bet you money they all star liking the MC more and more as the story progresses right?


                I'm a little confused at how you can think this story isn't intended to appeal to the.. Not sure what to call it, "being liked and surrounded by many hot chicks"? fantasy (which pretty much every story appeals to in some way some more and more overtly than others). Why would the author write all the dolls as girls? Why would their appearance be described in such detail? Why would they all be hot? I mean, if the intention was to make it not-sexy just don't make it sexy?  
                - and in-universe explanations are not explanations, they are excuses the author adds to write such a setting with logical consistency... Which again is perfectly fine, I'm not saying any of this is wrong.

                The only specific counter example to this is subverting and/or satirizing the genre, which this is clearly not.
                ```

                - u/Amonwilde:
                  ```
                  I feel the same way about a lot of story tropes. Your MC is a dungeon that gets rewarded for killing things, but there has to be some weird reasoning to justify it. You wanted to write the story where the dungeon kills things, just own it and write it.

                  I feel like people are drawn to a specific kind of story, but not able to recognize why they like it. Obviously they're not the kind of person to like harem, / psychopathic dungeons / NEET to hero transformation, they're only here for the article / "worldbuilding" / etc.

                  Some of the best stories just play things straight. Not everyone is Wales and not everything has to be an overwrought genre deconstruction. Genre deconstruction is the fig leaf that allows some to write their porn and wish fulfillment with a clear conscience.

                  The arguments you're getting are pretty amusing.
                  ```

                    ```
                    I get you and u/dragfie but I would probably wait until more chapters are posted before making that call. I thought something similar to you guys about Warby's Slumrat Rising until the somewhere mid book 2 and beyond. Not saying you guys should read anything you don't want to -- as someone who decided not to read this because he doesn't have unlimited time and other books just seem better, I don't really have a leg to stand on. Just a heads up that this probably isn't a thinly veiled fetish. (Man, I would look silly if it were, huh.)

                    Spoilers for Slumrat Rising:

                    >!A bit hard to reference if I'm spewing BS or not with the book taken off RoyalRoad but I remember clocking it as a story about a big bad corporation taking advantage of a rat (wow) from the slums (really?) who will need to rise (whoa!) up the ranks and take over with a lot of killing set in magitech Korea. (Which, like, he sort of does later but my reductive summary really misses the point.) When I dropped it, the MC was being set up as maybe Murder Jesus and I didn't think the hooks about the sinister corporation were enough to keep me invested in this Cyberpunk 2077 playthrough when if he was going to be that one note. !<

                    >! I ended up restarting it a bit after Book 2 started mostly because I remembered that I really liked To the Far Shore and I had forgotten how much I didn't like Book 1. That, and now I can skip all the chapters I technically read. Turns out this was all building to a point where it could be said that the message Slumrat Billionaire is trying to convey goes something like this: "Some losers are gonna point to nature in the wild and spout something about survival of the fittest and eating the competition but as thinking, intelligent humans we should not look to actual animals for life advice. If we are not helping our fellow man when we can afford to and striving to create a world where we can all be happy and healthy, why even be born a human."!<

                    >! All the violence in Book 1 that we were all enjoying? The hook that brought in readers? Psych. That shit is bad, bro. A world that rewards murder and actively promotes it is not it, dawg. Look, even our super soldier MC feels bad about the things he did. Not bad enough to stop, mind you, but he's trying to be better.!<

                    >! I dunno. I guess I'm trying to say that I am inclined to think the unpleasant stuff you find objectionable will be addressed later. Build up the fantasy with the expressed purpose of tearing it down, you feel?!<

                      Maybe you're right re: Warby specifics. I think what we're saying is, just write the thing. It doesn't always have to be a deconstruction, and you don't always have to have your characters wring their hands.

                  "There was a little more going on in there than in the Level Oneâs, but the glassy eyed stare and fixed smile was getting to me."

                  "The sheer hate in those words. The realness of it hammered at me. The desperate terror in their voices. I didnât want to hear this. I didnât want to know this!"

                  "Trapped with mostly mindless dolls."

                  "On the one hand, I was quite certain nobody on my side of the violence was âhumanâ in any biological sense. On the other hand, if these really were souls being shoved into golems, was âgirlâ appropriate?"

                  >The only specific counter example to this is subverting and/or satirizing the genre, which this is clearly not.

                  Repetitive lines from animated mannequins for those of low sentience to PTSD from an endless hell for those of high sentience, illogical time, being trapped to the HUB screen, in a body that isn't even human... it's a horrific view of a gacha game reality taken seriously. Plus the story *literally having the satire tag*.

                  Like I said, agree to disagree.

                  - u/IICVX:
                    ```
                    I actually had an even more fridge-logic horrifying reading of it myself - IMO the main character's sexual orientation has been forcibly changed so that he finds Versai attractive, regardless of his opinion on the matter. It's a lot easier to take it as a joke, but I do think his internal narration about preferring 2D girls is genuine. It'd be a lot more obvious if his previous preference had been, say, 2D boys. 

                    That being said this is probably similar to all those fascists who love Fight Club - in a thoroughly uncritical reading, satire can easily become the thing it's satirizing.

                      ```
                      I think it's a little silly to take his "preference for 2d girls" at face value. His narration barely makes an attempt at taking his own claim seriously. He knows he was just too afraid of rejection to interact with women and his entire inner monologue is a coping mechanism for his cripplingly low self-esteem
                      ```

    - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
      ```
      I completely understand your point. Having a charachter indulge in X, for an audience who wants to indulge in X, while complaining about the morality of X, just comes across as hypocritical. 

      However this story doesn't indulge in the sexiness of anime waifus so there's no hypocrisy. Its the gatcha game equivalent of a story with the theme about how that playing dark souls is fun but living it and actually feeling pain would be horrible.
      ```

      - u/Dragfie:
        ```
        Except he owns tones of hot wifus... you can make the rest of the setting as horrible as you want, it doesn't change that he owns tones of hot sexy wifus that like him. It's going to appeal to people who like that.
        ```

        - u/Susquick:
          ```
          I would be very surprised if more than a small subset of the "enjoys owning sexy waifus" demographic still found the story appealing on that basis after having read through more than a handful of chapters.

          Besides, unless I've missed something, I haven't yet had the impression any of the waifus actually like him, let alone in a romantic way. His "ownership" of them is also very constrained - he can't really order them around except for the specific purpose of defending the tower. He can't force himself on them, nor can he compel them to talk to him or interact with him in other ways against their will. I'm not sure what the fantasy could even be here, at least at this point in the story.

          The only "hope" I would have from this perspective is for the author to subvert expectations yet again and play the usual tropes straight later on in the story, but I strongly doubt this is what he's going for based on what I've read so far.
          ```

        - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
          ```
          And there are people who side with the Empire in Star Wars or think Homelander did nothing wrong. It doesn't matter.

          What matters is if the story is self consistent in its themes, and this one is. Its not hypocritically indulging in the sexiness of owning waifus while saying how immoral it is to own people. Its self-consistantly portraying it as an awful situation with no indulging.
          ```

          - u/Dragfie:
            ```
            Except it's our mc who is doing it and is absolutely indulging? - indulging in this case doesn't mean f****** them, it means owning them. An anti-hero fic from darth Vader's perspective indulging in the empire is absolutely appealing to those who'd like to feel such power, and is very different to him being the antagonist. 

            As a side point since im not sure this is clear, you don't need to think owning girls is right to enjoy the fantasy.

  Firstly I recommend a fanfiction called "[An Uncertain Magical Index](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/an-uncertain-magical-index.1127309/)" which is about "What if Index was actually the protagonist of A Certain Magical Index instead of just the titular waifu? Let's find out together." Second I would like to request any fiction with a protagonist who is very intelligent or has a perfect memory, fiction that fit that criteria is the "[Ash and Sand Series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/233409-ash-and-sand)" and the fanfiction named above.

    - u/Naitra:
      ```
      I really wanted to like Practical Guide to Sorcery, but it has some of the worst pacing and pointless exposition I've seen. It's about a million words, and 80% can be cut without affecting the plot in any way.
      ```

      - u/xjustwaitx:
        ```
        Admittedly I didn't feel the same way, but it's possible that's because bad pacing is such a common problem on RR that I've become immune
        ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          There has to be something structural about RR that encourages terrible pacing. Even if they start strong so much pacing drags.


          I don't remember fanfiction.net having as many problems with this, it's struggle was always finding the diamond in the dung and straight abandonment.
          ```

          - u/Naitra:
            ```
            It's mostly due to monetization. Horrible pacing = more chapters, and more chapters keeps the money flowing in a Patreon/Kindle Unlimited monetization model. Especially since writing a bunch of word vomit is much easier than writing actual plot developments. Gotta milk your patreon subscribers out of most money with least effort.
            ```

          - u/ProfessorPhi:
            ```
            The monetisation is a the big one one. Having regular updates results in more patrons so you're encouraged to put out stuff often instead of bangers rarely. Patrons also pay by month or chapter, both of which encourage regular posts -> quality> quantity.

            I find that once the initial set of chapters where the plot points are all thought out, the story tends to meander as stopping to plan the next arc out is death for the story. Some authors do this, but just continuing to write is the default meta and most readers are too bought in to leave.

            Additionally, it's actually really hard to be concise, "I tried to write a shorter letter, but I didn't have the time". Editing allows you fix this issue after the fact, but in a seralised format you rarely have the chance. Some authors are pretty good at being concise from the getgo, but it tends to be a rarity and a learned skill with some of them having written a lot ahead and releasing from a backlog that's been edited down.

            With practical guide to sorcery in particular, it was a meandering mess from the start with too many plot points opened up from the beginning.
            ```

      Does she? I honestly don't remember anything about her having a perfect memory. She's very smart and driven though.
      ```

      - u/aaannnnnnooo:
        ```
        There's a plot point concerning drugs that affect memory and her not remembering something is shown as unusual. A couple of times, the protagonist quickly remembers information and seeing it briefly/once, and it's frequently stated that she has an amazing memory.

        Most characters in fiction have astounding memories, because making 'incidentally forgetting something' a narrative obstacle feels contrived and arbitrary and weak no matter how realistic it is. Rather than a conceit of the story being the protagonist always remembers important stuff, it's an explicit part of the character in PGtS that she has an amazing memory.

  Mixed opinions. I enjoyed the setting and the author does an excellent job of really pulling all the various lore tidbits together into a compelling world. Initially it was great, but it started compounding and compounding, and I started to get lost with the sheer number of characters and factoids. Though I'm less enthused where I am now, I still tentatively recommend it.

    It's good, but at this point I'm hoping for a cast reset/timeskip. We're many millions of years pre-transformers canon right now, and the protagonist is (hopefully) about to achieve something momentous and heroic that we've been building up to for the entire runtime so far. Once that's done, I'm hoping she's frozen in carbonite (or equivalent) until canon starts.

  Hey guys! A bit of self-promo here, but some of you enjoyed the original, so I wanted to let you know that we are currently running a reprint and expansion campaign of Cosmos: Empires on Gamefound!

  https://gamefound.com/en/projects/bigger-worlds/cosmos-empires

  It is a 2-8 player tablue/engine-building card game, simple but deep, and the expansion adds a whole lot of cards and a-symmetrical start abilities.
  It's $35 AUD (~$22 USD) for BOTH expansion and origional together and both games come with sleeves for the cards in the box :)

  A print and play is available as well and the origional is on Board Game Arena so you can try it out.

  If you check it out thanks so much, it really helps, and I'd love your feedback as well! Thank you!

    [Cultivating Magic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cultivating-magic.1118890/) is a DnD/Xianxia double isekai crossover. Sadly it went on hiatus right as the plot was getting interesting. I also recommend the author's other story, Skitterdoc 2077, a cyberpunk2077/worm crossover that's the only wormfic I'm currently following. It's that good. 

    [World of Prime](https://www.goodreads.com/series/129874-world-of-prime) is a blessedly complete series where the setting is based off of DnD 1.5e, or so I've been told. The latter books especially reminded me a lot of the more cerebral Star Trek TNG episodes, with the plots often about acting within the limits of the MC's alignment (essentially a lawful good Paladin) in morally ambiguous situations and with bad faith actors that know how to exploit someone like that. Pretty groovy. 

    [Legends Never Die](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/legends-never-die-ahistorical-ckiii-gamer.1030193/?post=85884743#post-85884743) is a Crusader Kings isekai rather than DnD, but it's in the same spirit I think. It jumped the shark a bit for me with a sneaky Fate/whatever crossover, but still pretty good. 

    There's also [HP and the Natural 20](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8096183/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Natural-20), which a great crossover crack and kind of an isekai. If you squint. It's a frequent rec on here, though it's been abandoned for a long time.

    Planecrash (aka *Project Lawful*, aka *Mad Investor Chaos*) is a rationalist isekai set in the world of Pathfinder. It's Golarion rather than FaerÃ»n or Toril, but it's close enough, I think?

    Oops, I missed the setting distinction when I wrote my other comment. Here's two wormfics set in eberron, if that counts. Both are good, though the second suffers from too-many-POVs-itis imo.

  I'm looking for any slow burn progression story where the main character does not become immediately OP. I want a story that takes it time building its world building and characters before the MC is throwing hands with the strongest characters in the setting. Bonus points if the MC actually grows along other characters rather than just leaving them in the dust. Something like Super Supportive would work.

  Thanks

    **[Elydes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/67742/elydes/chapter/1195353/prologue)**: a sickly teenager reincarnates into magic not-Hawaii as it is being colonized. He finds that he's a second-class citizen in his own home.

    **[Bog Standard Isekai](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/69512/bog-standard-isekai-a-litrpg-progression-fantasy/chapter/1236585/book-1-chapter-1)**: a man is reincarnated into the body of recently-murdered child, in a ruined village patrolled by zombies.

    [Forge of Destiny](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21188/forge-of-destiny) has ~8 ranks of cultivation, story is 400 chapters in and the MC isn't even halfway to the peak despite being a very talented cultivator. A few of her friends started ahead of her, and remain ahead.

    [Pale Lights](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/65058/pale-lights) doesn't have concrete level scaling, but the strong can get *very* powerful. Multiple PoVs so despite more focus on a couple of MCs, there's a number of characters that grow alongside.

    Super Powereds by Drew Hayes, another multi-PoV situation where a group of outcast kids try to make it in a Superhero University. Kind of similar in setting to Super Supportive's current arc.

    Lord of the Mysteries, one of the most popular Chinese webnovels, this one has concrete numbers to the powerscaling. The journey takes about 1400 chapters, nearly 3M words. MC does advance rapidly, faster than others, but many characters remain extremely important for the entirety of the saga.

      Re: Forge of Destiny - Wait, she's *still* third rank?

      I stopped reading about half a million words ago to let the story build up, but I was expecting her to have progressed *much* further than that by now. She made it to rank three in less words than that.
      ```

      - u/CatInAPot:

        I believe so, though I'm slightly behind, there's like 8 stages within 3rd rank and it is *slow*.

          Alright, well. That's not good. 

          When a progression fantasy just stops progressing for *that* long, it generally indicates the author has lost track of the pacing. The story has been going for quite a few years at this point, so the author will be long dead before the protagonist becomes an actual powerhouse of the setting at this rate.

          Bleh.

    My [Touhou isekai](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/82051/yakumo-yukari-gapped-me-to-another-world-now-im) story is slow-burn progression where the MC grows alongside his friends, not immediately leaving them in the dust.

    The gist of the story is that an AI researcher from the future gets isekaied into Gensokyo. Once there, he finds out that things aren't as rosy as he'd been led to believe, and that a few hundred other Touhou fans were brought in with him. The genre is comedy horror.

    Also, I wrote it to be understandable to people who don't know anything about Touhou.

  I read all that's available of [*Brainpunch*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/75798/brainpunch)


  So far, good stuff. It's a superhero setting *heavily* inspired by Worm and features many similar mechanics: everything from how powers work to kill orders to endbringer-like regular disaster events. Its not really fanfic, but it's very adjacent.



  One thing that's particularly interesting, is that unlike Worm, the capes we've seen so far "play for keeps". It's generally much more viscous, cruel, and lethal--maybe it's just that we weren't shown this as much in Work, but the protagonist has already killed multiple people or been with (heroic) cape groups while they went out to explicitly kill villains (and unpowered mooks).Â 


  Compare this to Worm, and all the capes are downright gentlemen. Sure, it's alluded to (?) that hostile groups like the E88 white supremacists regularly beat minorites and *might* be responsible for young cape disappearances, but *Brainpunch* is just no holds barred.Â 


  Only real point of criticism that I have is that there isn't more of it and the chapter release rate has dropped off to an optimistic 1x per month.
  ```

  - u/Audere_of_the_Grey:
    ```
    the RR description is putting me off because it should be extremely obvious to characters in a setting with actual superpowers to try applying the ten-pounds-of-force power to enemies' innards, across extremely thin lines (for extreme amounts of pressure and therefore cutting power), etc. it's sounding like a story where characters hold idiot balls and miss obvious power uses sitting right in front of them. is this impression inaccurate?
    ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:
      ```
      I dropped it for other reasons, but my understanding was more that the world has a Manton effect and her power is not manton limited, so the story tends to find her trying to avoid using it to not be outed.
      ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      The protagonist, who, in true Worm style, has a whole host of issues, is the main person who writes her power off as dumb.Â 


      Others are quick to point out that she's just being stupid and with the right tools, it's fine, and she quickly starts using cool tricks like TK moving a cloud of pepper spray or forcing multiple Kg of cocaine up someone's nose.



      While the protagonist has her blindspots and dumb moments, I wouldn't really call that "idiot ball".

    I wonder if the author ever read the fanfic *That gnawing worm, cancer*.

  - u/ReproachfulWombat:
    ```
    'Worm, but even *more* bleak' is certainly *an* idea. I'm not sure it's a good one, though.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Interestingly, I wouldn't really call it "bleak", just more... hardcore? realistic? Not quite sure, but it really made me think about how few people actually get killed "on-screen" in Worm when everyone's running around with deadly superpowers.

      Specifically, I didn't find *Brainpunch* particularly depressing, and it is significantly funnier than Worm (not that it's a comedy though). Where Worm has this pervasive sense of spiraling doom and "one step forwards, fall down the staircase backwards"-pattern this just isn't a theme in *Brainpunch*.
      ```

      - u/thomas_m_k:
        ```
        I'm not sure it's more realistic. Most people generally don't like killing others. And, maybe more importantly, they don't like to be killed themselves. If everyone agrees to not kill one  another, and punish those harshly who do (put them into the bird cage or set a kill order), then you yourself are also less likely to get killed.

        I guess this sort of thing requires that people with superpowers are able to recognize that they are better off if they coordinate to not kill and punish killers. I guess it could be more realistic if superpowered people fail to coordinate and defect against each other by frequently killing others.

        Though, in that situation, I'd imagine the unpowered public would not sit idly by (like they kind of do in Worm) while these maniacs kill each other. They might start having ideas like deciding the police should shoot people with superpowers on sight.

        As a voter, I certainly wouldn't like to have people fight to the death in my city.
        ```

        - u/Dragongeek:
          ```
          I think it's more realistic in the sense that people are really fragile. Over a thousand people die globally every day from falling down, and while sure, many of these unfortunate fatalities probably happened to the elderly or otherwise with pre-existing conditions, the point remains. 

          More generally, a lot of the violence we see in the superhero genre that's "non lethal" on screen would absolutely be lethal in real life or have serious medical consequences that last for life. People don't just get knocked out and then wake up ten minutes later and continue living their lives as normal. A single hit to your unprepared knee can cripple you for life. Unless the individual is a "brute", they could just get shoved, bang their head on a curb, and bam, they're dead. Happens in real life all the time. 

          The idea that in Worm, many individuals with eminently lethal power sets, aren't just accidentally killing people left and right is wild. Like, one of the heroes (Miss Militia) literally has the power to summon guns, and while she uses "non-lethal" ammunition like beanbags or rubber bullets in the book, the reality is that "non-lethal" doesn't exist and this type of stuff is actually  classified as "less-lethal" because while not as deadly as bullets, people still get killed by them. 

          My point is that once you have the power, being non-lethal is *extremely difficult* to do and takes a lot of time, skill, effort, and willingness to endanger oneself. This is part of the reason why the police in the US shoot and kill so many people: if some guy is waving around a knife and refuses to surrender and charges towards a cop, they get shot. In this case, it's the ""easy"" solution, if the alternative is to get real close and  try using a Taser (hit or miss) or attempting to beat a crazy dude with a knife in hand-to-hand and possibly ending up stabbed themselves. 

          The idea that basically all of the villains who are tolerated in Worm are competent enough to successfully keep basically every fight non-lethal? Please. Especially once you start considering all the wacky powers: maybe someone has a conditional brute power where they are tougher when their feet are touching the ground, so you blast them with your laser, but oops, they jumped just a split second before and reverted to normal durability. Bam, dead. Or, you've got a forcefield, and someone telekinetically fires a stick of rebar at you to break it down--only the rebar bounces off your shield, goes through a wall, and impales some random dude half a kilometer away. All very possible. 

          As to your second point about voting, obviously I'm not you, but for a large portion of human history, people were perfectly fine and even supportive of simply killing outlaws in an extrajudicial setting. Classic "dead or alive" bounties only died out a bit over a 100 years ago. Even today, the death penalty is still a hotly debated topic with three sides who are all firmly convinced in thier position. 

          About how the public at large would react though... I'm not sure. In Worm, at least, it's implied (or mentioned via WOG) that the Cauldron conspiracy explicitly takes steps to reduce civilian-on-cape violence. This presumably means everything from pushing through strict gun laws to making armed non-cape vigilante groups fail/disappear.
          ```

          - u/aaannnnnnooo:
            ```
            The unrealistic sturdiness of people in books is a problem in any genre that features frequent action. Humans heal slowly and if a person has a 5% chance of dying in a fight, it takes an astonishingly low number of fights for the culminative probability of death being 50% or higher. With how often heroes fight crime, unless they have durability or healing powers, they will die within a year of starting their crime-fighting careers.

            If a story wants to be realistic, then the only way a protagonist survives the story will be if they have durability or healing powers available to them. If powersets are specific, then a minority of people will have durability or healing beyond baseline human so fighting with powers will inevitably kill people. That is a feature of the world.

            The most realistic thing would be making power usage on other people the same legally as shooting a gun at another person. Unless a regulatory agency have extensively tested a power to be confident that it cannot kill or even seriously harm a person, the powers should be treated as deadly as guns. Only point a gun at something you intend to shoot, only use your powers if you're prepared to kill a person while doing so.
            ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        Higher lethality isn't actually more realistic - That sort of social setup is unstable as heck.

         Either the heroes or villains win, or they all make themselves unpopular enough that both sides get suppressed by whatever means necessary. 

        The whole colorful people in capes thing actually works best when "playing to the crowd" is a big part of the point for all involved. Which needs rules that keep the "game" within bounds acceptable to the public.
        ```
