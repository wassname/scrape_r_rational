## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Battle-school worldbuilding, pt. 4 ([pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7vwof7/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dtw306v/), [pt. 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7xim6q/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/du8n1im/), [pt 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7z66gn/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/dulzjqx/?context=3))

  Now for some social stuff. I realized early on that I wanted trial-by-combat, but not in the form it takes in, say, *A Song of Ice and Fire* where it's an exceptional or noteworthy thing. In the Fencer trilogy by K.J. Parker, there are fencers-at-law, which is an awesome title, but there they serve more as hired guns rather than people with an actual stake engaging in the combat/trial, and given that they're hired, fencers-at-law seem like they don't actually change the society *too* much, in that the rich can still effectively buy their way out of problems with the poor.

  Instead, I want the trial-by-combat to have personal stakes, so:

  * Anyone fighting in your place must be a *direct* blood relative (mother/father/sister/brother) or legally married to you.
  * In certain extreme circumstances, the fights are "naked", e.g. without the magical arena putting you back together after

  This means:

  * People have a pretty large incentive to marry a skilled fighter, especially if they have a trial coming up
  * Bastards are left out in the cold unless they're formally recognized
  * Orphans are left to fend for themselves
  * Parents have incentive to raise at least one strong fighter who can take care of them when they become to old to effective fight
  * Parents have incentive to raise a large number of children, both in order to ensure that they will be legally protected, and to ensure that the children will be able to protect each other

  All of which are probably good for the setting and the general martial culture it's intended to have. *However*, you might have noticed the immediate problem, which is that a good enough fighter could just steamroll their way through any legal problem, to the detriment of society as a whole (not really a problem) including the other elites (definitely a problem). To remedy that:

  * Adjudicators exist as pseudo-judges, with a little bit of detective mixed in; they weigh evidence, listen to testimony, conduct investigations, and while they don't actually pass judgement, as that's the purpose of trial-by-combat, they *do* set the terms of the trial, and are endowed with the power of setting asymmetric rules that favor one combatant or the other in especially egregious cases. This would never be to the point where one combatant is *assured* of victory, only to the point where one is disadvantaged because some burden of proof has been met.
  * Adjudicators come from the elite class, usually as third or fourth children that are of less value to the family, or as sickly, infirm, maimed, etc. that would never be more than a burden. (I don't think that there are enough elites in the setting relative to the commoners that there would be enough adjudicators for all the commoners, so perhaps there are two classes, with elite/commoner disputes being handled exclusively by the elite adjudicators.)
  * Adjudicators also have wide latitude in setting the terms of the battles, but it's often expected that the battle will have some sort of theme or ironic twist such that the battle is representative of the legal conflict (e.g. if it's about fishing rights, both combatants might be forced to use nets or tridents). This might be a little too Rule of Cool though.
  * Because there has to be some additional lever of power against the adjudicators, any individual adjudicator can be put into their own special trial-by-combat on the say-so of a quorum of adjudicators. Family loyalties *probably* help to prevent the entire adjudicator class from going rogue.

  And then there's one additional problem to be solved, which is that legal battles aren't just person against person, they're person against corporation, or person against state.

  * In legal disputes between an individual and the state, the state combatant is selected from a "jury pool" made up of volunteers from among the elite. It is considered an honor to defend the state, combatants are given a generous influx of funds, and you are granted the goodwill of the adjudicators. Adjudicators can refuse members of the jury pool due to conflicts of interest, or for a few other reasons like being unfit for combat.
  * In legal disputes against a corporation, any member of the corporation with at least 20% stake can fight for the corporation. In the absence of anyone having that much stake, the person with the highest stake will be selected.

  I *think* that both covers everything, and gives a lot of fodder for plot/story, as well as helping to hit on some of what I hope are the themes of the story, like inadequate equilibria and the difficulties inherent in changing entrenched systems (plus the way that those in power are the ones who benefit from the system being as it is).

    Interesting, if only because it disincentivizes anyone from holding a particularly large stake in a corporation that is large enough to be sued. Another thing that could be exploited is insider trading. Suppose some people have information that a case against the company is coming up, then they have the opportunity to liquidate prior to the case being filed and maybe force some poor schmuck to fight to the death. I think there are some serious economic ramifications here.

    Re: adjudicators, you might be interested in *Legal Systems Very Different From Ours*, specifically this passage from the Slate Star Codex [review](http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/11/13/book-review-legal-systems-very-different-from-ours/) of it:

    >The Somali system seems to be somewhere around here: if two people have a dispute, they find a mutually agreeable judge to arbitrate; the judge will decide who’s in the wrong and what fine they need to pay to make it right. If someone refuses to go to the judge, or refuses to abide by the judge’s decision, then it’s family-member-killing time. Needless to say, Somali judges’ services remain popular. And since judges gain status by arbitrating, and since only judges who make widely-regarded-as-good decisions get invited to keep doing so, there’s economic pressure for the judges to make good decisions (which then go down as precedent and inspire future cases). 

    TL;DR: 'Judge' is just another job on the open market.  People can choose to arbitrate their disputes using a mutually acceptable judge, or they can refuse and make a blood-feud.

    Some quickfire plots/stories (I recommend this exercise for any large worldbuilding project):

    * Due to an upcoming match and an ailing patriarch, a bastard is legitimized
    * After the death of her brother and a separate social disgrace, an accountant marries the most martially proficient commoner she can find so that she has someone to defend her
    * People begin selling stock in a company that's due for a trial that will almost certainly be adjudicated extremely unfavorably, shareholders attempting to escape with as little loss as possible. A fifth son buys up the stock for pennies on the dollar, gambling that he can win and make a name for himself.
    * Two sons fight over which of them will defend their father, in a family drama type of situation (both were raised as fighters on the theory that one of them might not make it to adulthood)
    * Due to some rather unusual circumstances, an adjudicator in a rural area is forced to adjudicate for a dispute that his own family is involved in, and must walk the line between family and justice
    * An adjudicator makes what he believes is a just ruling in setting up a match, but background pressures mean that his censure is demanded, especially since otherwise the ruling he made might be cited as precedent. He's forced to fight for his life.
    * In a high-profile case, members of the jury pool begin recusing themselves, until a single man must choose whether or not he will fight for what he believes are the correct politics, or bow to social pressure.

  Just something I've been thinking of after seeing Black Panther. 

  Is there any way to build a rational Wakanda that keeps the outline of the movie world intact? Isolationist, highly advanced and so on?

  Cause I can't see it. If, as the movie says, they've always been more advanced it seems like the most "rational" Wakanda pushes out from its home with the vibranium weapons and trying to pacify the tribes around it till it gets to the sea (or Egypt, depending on where it's located and...we just don't know). The mere possession of vibranium and time doesn't necessarily give Wakanda a hundred year head start on people. Especially given their steadfast refusal to sell it.

  Or is there some use case for vibranium that I'm missing that makes what we see in the film possible?
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    Vibranium infuses the plants and soil, making all land outside of Wakanda worthless for agriculture.  They *could* rule over a colonial territory the size of Africa (or larger), but they would rather stay at home.
    ```

    - u/RynnisOne:
      ```
      Wait, how does this make sense?

      Either Vibranium is *good* for the soil, in which case why would it make the surrounding land bad?

      Or Vibranium is *bad* for the soil, in which case Wakanda needs to import food, in which case it pretty much *has* to be an Empire to survive.
      ```

      - u/ulyssessword:
        ```
        Vibranium is good, which makes the rest of the world bad by comparison.  Leaving Wakanda means leaving the superfood behind, a sacrifice that only spies and politicians are forced to make.

        If needed, that could be a change introduced as AU to rationalify the setting.
        ```

  - u/RynnisOne:
    ```
    I've wanted to take a crack at a "rational" Wakanda myself, but pretty sure some people would be grumpy at my approach.

    Generally any country which has one singular, amazing resource is just going to be rich from outside money as others come to acquire it.  On its own, however, it's just got a funky material that may be used commonly where everywhere else its non-existant (the movie mentioned them weaving Vibranium into their clothes, but we never saw much practical application of that).

    Movie Wakanda isn't thought through very well.  OK, so some meteorite landed in prehistoric times.  It's also made of this nigh-invulnerable metal.  So how did the tribes mine it in the first place?  Did they already have metallurgy?  Did they somehow spontaneously develop it from working with a material much more durable and damage resistant than, say, copper, tin, or iron?

    How did their society advance so quickly?  Just having a magic metal won't cause that.  Being isolationist won't do much either, since, similar to various turn-based civilization building games, you're going to miss out on a *lot* of possible developments simply because there aren't enough people to randomly discover all of them.

    We have evidence of some 7th or 10th century Viranium weapons, but it's just an axe or pick looking thing.  OK, why is that special?  Iron was used anywhere up to a millennia before that.  A melee weapon made of the stuff would be good against other weapons of 'standard' metals, but it's not as crazy as the Vibranium based blasters (nevermind how, if Cap has a shield of the stuff and Panther a suit, and it *absorbs kinetic energy*, it should be functionally useless as a weapon, because it would absorb the energy of its own impact).

    Why are the herbs not eaten by everyone to turn them into an entire society of Superhumans?  I mean, they won't be Kryptonians or anything, but they'd be much better off if everyone had the "power of the panther" than just one guy at a time.  I get there's some mystical things going, but how does that tie in to an alien metal from the stars?

      "Movie" Wakanda is hardly rational at all.  It can be fixed, but it would change a *lot* of the backstory to have it make sense.
