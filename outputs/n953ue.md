## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I picked up Andy Weir's new book *Project Hail Mary* over the weekend and tore through it in 2 days. It's an awesome book of the stay-up-til-3am, laugh-out-loud, miss-the-characters-afterward variety. While there are a few elements that strain belief, they're easy to accept for the sake of the narrative; Weir loves exploring edge cases of technology & engineering, so I'm willing to give him a pass or two to get where he wants to go. Highly recommended, so much fun.

    I really enjoyed this rec (and previously enjoyed _The Martian_). 

    It's been a long time since I've read 'optimistic' sci-fi where humanity bands together and pursues a single titanic goal. _Project Hail Mary_ really scratched that itch for me. 

    The numerous mini-crises + problem solving sessions were well executed, although they did feel a little repetitive after a while. "Oh, things are going so well right now, I guess it's time for something else to go wrong in 3... 2... there we go." This formulaic approach might have been exacerbated by the fact that I read the book in a single sitting because it was nevertheless a gripping read.

    All in all, two thumbs up, very enjoyable.

    I read it because of your rec and it was great. It's cool that he replies to emails. He lampshaded a bunch of stuff to justify the probabilities but it's obviously for the sake of the story.

    Only two minor mistakes I spotted:

    >!The spaceship atmo was 40%, they gave him 1 Oxygen and 29 Ammonia, that means that it's not 29 Atmospheres it's more like 12, or the alien should've gave him way more !<

    >!At the start he could've been British not just English, and he could've simply said colour or some other word to identify what nationality!<

  If you are at all into Interactive Fiction (think "Zork") but haven't done it in a while, check out [Counterfeit Monkey](https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=aearuuxv83plclpl). You are on Atlantis and have linguistic magic. You can remove a letter from words to transmogrify them (ie, turn a clamp into a clam) and later can do more complex manipulations. Honestly that's one of the greatest rational magic systems I've encountered --  a simple rule that you can exploit. ([My full review](https://taogaming.wordpress.com/2021/05/07/counterfeit-monkey/)).

- u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
  ```
  I'm reading [*Demesne*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne), and it's pretty good so far. It's about a group of people who set out to build a town in the middle of nowhere. It's not really kingdom building, more like homesteading. But in a magical land with monsters and where the land around you is poisonous.

  The MC is a magician who leads the group by virtue of being the only one who can "purify" the land and keep everyone from dying. I'm pretty sure she has antisocial personality disorder (i.e. she's a sociopath). She's not evil or killing people left and right, but she does lack empathy and has a pretty weak conscience. She's helped by Rian (Ryan) a guy who got isekaied and ends up her second in command. The story isn't about him, he just provides help and advice to show up the MC's shortcomings.

  The world is pretty neat. It's filled with monsters, but not the "really fast with lots of fangs" type. More like exposure to magic over time causes mutations, so you end up with plants with teeth or animals with three limbs and two necks but one head.

  The writing is well done. No spelling/grammar mistakes that I can recall.

  If you like people building stuff with magic, I'd recommend this story.
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    Note that Rian being an isekai is teeeeeechnically not canon - the "Ryan is an Isekai" chapter was published on April 1st and is now thread marked as Apocrypha on SB. 

    I mean he still probably is (Ryan is even a classic isekai protag name), but it's not proven in canon yet.
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      I dunno, he seems to have >!invented the sandwich.!< Classic Earther move.
      ```

  - u/CreationBlues:
    ```
    Actually, while magic causes mutations it's canon that the biosphere is absolutely not the one we're familiar with. Those mutations were caused by a dragon storm, which basically randomly transmutes everything. Rian is also only being heavily teased as an isekai, though from a lot of examples, such as knowing what bacteria are but not the common name for them, it's pretty obvious what his deal is.

    I'll also second that the magic system is interesting and limited, with lots of it not yet revealed.
    ```

  - u/callmesalticidae:
    ```
    Hm... I think I'll have to put this on my to-read list. It does sound interesting. 

    Does it feel like the author has done their research, or does it come off more "dude who has never stepped outside a city nevertheless tries to write about farming?"
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      I have no idea how actual homesteading works, but it does seem like the author has put a fair amount of thought into the actions/decisions the characters make.

      The MC does use her magic as a huge crutch, but while it's powerful it isn't all-powerful, and there is a limit to what can be done. They're really focusing on building shelter and securing their food supply (mainly via hunting/gathering), which makes sense to me.
      ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Bit unrelated but is there any button I am not seeing that will bring me straight to last chapter?   RR seems super clunky compared to other reading sites?
    ```

    - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
      ```
      If you have an account add the story to you follow list, then it will show the latest chapter uploaded. If you set it to set the page to "V2" it's easier to see.

      If you're using the story page, you can click on "Release Date" to order it from latest to oldest.
      ```

    - u/MagmaDrago:
      ```
      There is `Open Next Chapter` in the follow list if you've followed the story and `Continue Reading` in the fics main page. 

      Or do you mean the last chapter of fic? There is none except for choosing from the ToC.

  Any recommendations for rationalist or adjacent Star Wars fanfics? Ideally something that explores Potentium, or where characters take the approach of exploring the limits of the Force, sorcery traditions, etc.

      Thanks a lot for the recommendations. 

      I'm fascinated by A Voice Across the Void. I felt both dread and amazement.

      Reading it feels like seeing many trains going off the rails. Some crash with each other, some fall down, others manage to find their intended destination faster. One exploded, and this is good because baby Hitler was on it. 

      Very appropriately, it feels like watching the start of events that have been foreseen by a master mind. A pity it's not any longer.

    > I hate Jedi and how their philosophy makes no sense.

    You're supposed to hate the Jedi. The Star Wars prequels make the most sense as a story the failure of a liberal democracy to effectively combat the rise of fascism. [Here's a nice blog series on this theme.](http://prequelsredeemed.blogspot.com/p/prequels-table-of-contents.html)
     You might get more out of them from that viewpoint.

    (None of this invalidates the stuff you're looking for in your rec though; that stuff still sounds cool.)
    ```

  - u/loltimetodie_:
    ```
    Not a fic, but you may be interested in Noah Caldwell-Gervais' recent video on [Knights of the Old Republic & Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OI2iOB8ydGo) (other people are recommending playing the latter, so maybe give that one a shot first if you're worried about spoilers).

    Yes, it's a video essay - don't go! hear me out! - but it's treated like an *actual* essay, with a thesis, proper structure, etc., as opposed to the usual four hour behemoths that manage to ramble over every aspect of something without going into depth on any of it.

    The structural focus is about Joseph Campbell's 'Hero's Journey', and the how each game engages with its use in the Star Wars franchise/universe: the first straight on, and the second aggressively subverting it. **Why am I recommending it to you here?** It turns out that basically **everything** weird about the force and Jedi are the way they are because Lucas basically **directly adapted Campbell's weird-ass book** and all the spiritual frameworks for what the hero must do into aspects of the Force and Jedi. Jedi can't fuck? Campbell. The demand that you utterly annihilate your ego? Campbell. Jedi masters somehow surpassing all good, evil, and lesser mortal concerns in their unity with the universal will? You'd better believe that's Campbell. *The Hero With a Thousand Faces* can basically be read like a foundational religious text for the Jedi.

    Really eye-opening for me, highly recommended, listen to the first 10 minutes and if you fw it, put it on in the background like a podcast or something.
    ```

    - u/bigbysemotivefinger:
      ```
      Man, I haven't read Campbell in like a million years. I knew Luke's story was a textbook hero's journey, but the rest I didn't put together.

  - u/Kachajal:
    ```
    I think you might like [Star Wars: The Penumbral Path](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/star-wars-a-penumbral-path.60200/). It takes place a few years before the clone wars, and follows some original characters - two trainee jedi who are taken as padawans by two very unorthodox masters.

    So far the story has delved pretty deeply into jedi philosophy and why it may or may not be correct, as well as a little bit into other force-sorcery traditions. It has a fairly interesting and reasonable take on the dark side, too.

    The two masters - one of them once a padawan of the other - are very unusual, and at odds with the jedi order, but still very much consider themselves jedi. They're both interesting characters with very differing approaches to most aspects of the jedi.

    It's one of my favorite fics I've read recently, it *really* nails the feeling of a journey.

  ```
  I have been reading [Fairy Dance of
  Death](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2393225/) [warning: incomplete] by
  [Catsy](http://ayashi.net/sao/). It's a very good Sword Art Online fanfic, an
  epic from multiple character points of view, narrating the story of several
  fantasy states and their diplomacy and wars. I found it in r/HPMOR's
  recommendation thread.

  The characters are trapped in a game where you die for real, but this time the
  creator was obsessed with Norse mythology instead of swords, and created the
  game of [Alfheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lfheimr) Online. The
  players choose one of [six fairy
  factions](http://pm1.narvii.com/6023/acff8330b15ad004cf6297c1d85e6837f19e47b0_00.jpg),
  which each have their own territory, capital city and monthly-elected faction
  leader. The race that manages to clear the World Tree, Yggdrasil, can choose two
  allied races who all obtain the power of unlimited flight, and can thus escape
  the world.

  As whenever you [divide humans into clearly delimited
  groups](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MBpj3QKfPg9xKNeXW/the-robbers-cave-experiment),
  the relationships between factions quickly devolve into xenophobia and war. It
  (doesn't) help that only the first race to arrive at the tree is guaranteed an
  escape from the death game, so there is further pressure driving the factions
  apart.

  I don't want to say too much, lest I spoil it. It's very long and well-written,
  and has been in the works for 9 years now. The last update is from January 2020,
  though, just before the whole COVID thing. I hope the author is OK and merely
  has moved on from writing it. Much less important, the desire to know what comes
  next has prompted me to write this review, and ask if someone knows whether the
  author will write more?

  Another one of Catsy's SAO fanfics that I really enjoyed is [Man in the
  Middle](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9303028/1/Man-in-the-Middle), which I found
  in r/rational a few years ago. It's a story about the world outside the game,
  and how they deal with the fact that players are trapped within.
  ```

  - u/Badewell:
    ```
    Another second for this one, great story.

    Catsy is still active in the story thread on SpaceBattles with a post as recent as last week and has confirmed that the fic isn't dead. He'll post smaller updates of the chapter in progress there as well, though nothing has been posted for a while and I normally like just waiting until the full chapter is done.
    ```

    - u/Aqua-dabbing:
      ```
      > Catsy is still active in the story thread on SpaceBattles with a post as recent as last week and has confirmed that the fic isn't dead

      Thank you, I'm very happy to hear that! They seem to be OK too, just some writer's block.
      ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Seconding this for those who don't mind an unfinished fic.

    It's the kind of fanfic that leans hard on worldbuilding the parts that were window dressing in canon. Like Naruto fic that asks "what the hell is a jutsu anyway," or Harry Potter fic that asks "what is the entire rest of the planet doing while Voldemort is rampaging around Britain?" In this case, it does double duty by presenting ideas that would be *incredibly cool* in a game. This is probably a little trite to say on this subreddit, but the magic system really stands out, and gave me ideas for my own ongoing project.

    The drama comes from the politics and interpersonal clashes as well as the mechanics of the game in a way that's much more satisfying than canon.

    Also, Man in the Middle is both complete and much shorter than Fairy Dance, so if you're looking to try the author's style, start there.
    ```

    - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:
      ```
      > Harry Potter fic that asks "what is the entire rest of the planet doing while Voldemort is rampaging around Britain?"

      Do you actually happen to know any fics like that?  The closest thing I can think of is the [Alexandra Quick series](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3964606/1/Alexandra-Quick-and-the-Thorn-Circle), which takes place in the United States, around ten years after Voldemort's second fall.  Iirc, the effects in Britain had major geopolitical effects that were felt even in the States, and the story's overarching conflict has to do with dealing with those aftereffects.

      I actually didn't end up following the Alexandra Quick series after book 1, but I'd be interested in learning of anything similar.
      ```

      - u/netstack_:
        ```
        I also read the first AQ book and never got around to the others.

        It was harder than I expected to dig these up, but here’s a few that I think fit. They tended towards canon divergence rather than AQ’s canon avoidance.

        * [Arithmancer series](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/10070079/1/The-Arithmancer) seems to expand out from hogwarts after the first book. Haven’t finished it though.
        * [Mountains of the moon](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12306845/1/The-Mountains-of-the-Moon), in which Harry transfers to a wizarding school in Uganda. Haven’t read this but quite like the author.
        * in general crack fic seems more willing to fly off the the canon settings
        * there was something I read but can’t find in which a retired Auror from Australia is an important character
        ```

        - u/surt2:
          ```
          The one with the Australian Auror might be *The Accidental Animagus* and its sequel, which are by the same author as the Arithmancer series.
          ```

  - u/Roxolan:
    ```
    Seconding *Fairy Dance of Death*. 

    It's a slow burn (and I've actually dropped it for now until more chapters have accumulated). Characters are mostly reasonable people interacting with complex game mechanics. Because it's a *large* amount of people who all got thrown into the game at the same time, and because the game was designed around factions to begin with, some of the discoveries alter the whole social dynamics instead of just one character's personal munchkinry. That's an under-explored area in litRPG IME. Game theory is a bitch.

    It's a shame this fic has a kind of awkward title, when *Immortal Object* was right there.
    ```

    - u/Aqua-dabbing:
      ```
      Good analysis.

      > It's a shame this fic has a kind of awkward title, when Immortal Object was right there.

      Huh? Why should that be the title? Immortal objects are not featured prominently.
      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        Immortal objects exist as a constant reminder that the world's physics are ultimately game code no matter how many layers the players build upon them. It's also a dark joke about how the players themselves are very much *not* immortal. And >!a major plot point is that weird maybe-NPC tempting players with true immortality.!< 

        Other titles could work of course, I just found that term particularly striking.

  I recently read Double Fold, which a long nonfiction book about the history of microfilm within US library systems (heard about it from a friend who heard about from the SSC book review contest).

  It's not an unbiased book; it's angry and very against the proliferation of microfilm as a substitute for storing old newspapers and other documents. I'm looking for more books written in the same style: nonfiction, extremely polemical, biased, or opinionated, *but only about extremely niche, ultraspecific issues that very few people actually care about*. I want "old man yells at cloud" energy.

  I'm also looking for reading lists of good nonfiction in general, preferably ones that offer summaries/reviews of the works being recommended. I like Gwern's list of books, so anyone with anything like that would be fantastic.
  ```

  - u/andor3333:
    ```
    [Novum Organum](https://oll.libertyfund.org/title/bacon-novum-organum) by Francis Bacon is an interesting read.  Bacon is sometimes called the father of empiricism and wrote Novum Organum in 1620 to introduce learning through observation, and as a rejection of the idea that philosophers like Plato and Aristotle were always right and their knowledge could never be surpassed by modern societies.

    It is the opposite of biased really, since if anything it is polemical against biases in particular. I wouldn't call it niche exactly, but not many people read about the origins of scientific thought.

  hot take: i've decided i don't particularly care for Unsong (I am 85% of the way through by my Kindle's reckoning). My husband loves it so we've had a discussion. Seems to boil down to:

  - while I find the kabbalistic puns interesting/clever they don't carry the day for me (they are by far my husband's favourite element, whereas I was sick of the biblical whale puns like one page in)

  - the characters aren't interesting to me (most interesting are Uriel and the comet king's wife, who seems to be a very minor character, and Sohu)

  - a lot of characters are broadly similar and hard to distinguish (e.g. Ana and Erica, yes I know the difference, but I forget who is doing what - like who is with Booyum, who is on the ship, etc, especially with the time skips, I thought Erica at Booyum was a flashback of Ana's life for longer than I should have)

  - the fact it jumps across time a LOT makes it  hard to follow things 

  - all the little factions aren't easy for me to follow or integrate together: I don't really care about booyum and i don't get how placebomancy comes into it (are booyum placebomancers? they're not are they? they just have placebomancers?), the drug king seems like a whole thing, the other king is maybe the same as the drug king, the *Not a Metaphor* was interesting but felt ultimately pointless, all the American politics stuff doesn't seem to tie in

  - i don't find myself rooting for anything/anyone. a lot of stuff is happening but i don't particularly care about it.

  - the premise of "turns out religion is true and the world is cracking" is really, really cool, but I don't care for which parts of it are being explored. maybe i should look into fanfic of it? 

  - my religious background growing up was catholic and I consider myself well-versed in catholic lore, which is obviously not as intense as jewish lore


  The point of this post is not "ELI5" all the elements I've no doubt misunderstood, it's more, "If you didn't like unsong, you're not alone", and maybe if there's some element of its awesomeness that I've overlooked then let me know. 

  FWIW I will of course be finishing it. I don't know if there's a twist at the end that makes everything make sense or something like that, but my opinion on that sort of thing is that books with twists at the end have to be enjoyable all the way through because one mind-blowing twist  doesn't make up for hours of mediocre story.
  ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    I don't expect the ending to revise your opinion of the whole thing.

    I did think the ending was well executed, but then I enjoyed the moment-to-moment experience of reading the whole thing (puns, weird references, interludes completely derailing the main thread, etc.). Part of this may have been due to reading as it released, as there were mysteries that really didn't get addressed until weeks or months of meatspace time. These also drove a lot of theorization and discussion on SSC, which was fun to watch.
    ```

  - u/Luonnoliehre:
    ```
    I feel your critiques are pretty fair. What I loved about Unsong was the unique world, the weird and quirky alt-history, and the witty dialogue between Urial and Sohu and others. 

    Unfortunately the plot splinters into 5 different povs across 50 years, and the pacing is just abysmally slow. I too pretty much lost interest in the characters, as no one really has much agency and seems to just move from scenario to scenario. The ending is okay but really the whole thing should be reworked to be viably read as a novel.

      I mostly disagree with the characterization of Unsong as a "mystery box", at least in the sense that, say, [qntm uses the phrase "mystery box" when describing various Star Wars films](https://qntm.org/mystery). In Unsong, the central mysteries and uncertainties of the plot are in fact *resolved*, and the mysteries' solutions were baked into the plot from the beginning with foreshadowing and authorial intent, not a result of haphazard flailing. It has a bunch of *mysteries*, but pretty much every mystery of importance gets a solution by the end of the book that seems pretty satisfactory to me - a "mystery box" work and "the story has mysteries" are very much *not* the same thing.

      (On another note I actually love flashbacks and nonlinear storytelling in general as a method, when used well - e.g. my single favourite of Iain Banks' Culture books was Use of Weapons, in no small part because of the brilliant structure of the book. This is not a disagreement about facts, though, so much as a disagreement of taste, and de gustibus non est disputandum).

      I completely disagree with this. Unsong is not a mystery box in any way. It *is* a contrived crazy system of coincidences and kabalistic puns, but that is the nature of the beast. It does not make it a mystery box.

  I just finished reading Kazuo Ishiguro's *The Remains of the Day* a few hours ago.  It's the story of an aged butler at a high manor in the mid-1900s taking a vacation for a week while his employer is away, and him reminiscing over his life so far.  

  I really enjoyed it.  There's no real plot to speak of, but the main character is fairly intelligent and spends quite a bit of time thinking about ideas like "dignity" and our place in the world, which was handled fairly well in my view.  It was shorter than I expected, so if you're looking for something comfortable or wistful to read, I recommend this highly.

    I love this book. Not exactly rational, since as with most Ishiguro novels it seems to center around a character whose delusions slowly become apparent to the reader. But as a deep character study it is beautifully done and sentimental without being cloying.

  A couple of recommendations from me:

  [Desolada](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41670/desolada) is a rational fantasy serial dealing with magic, philosophy, and >!pacts with demons!<.

  [Evil Eye: Hexcaller](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/41836/evil-eye-hexcaller) is a litRPG involving elements of character build optimization and a whodunit.
  ```

  - u/WISHFULFILLMENTSUCKS:
    ```
    Some parts of Hexcaller does not make sense. When the undead attacked the MC decided not to go because he was untrained and he won’t be that much useful which was smart. However, He then convinced a noble girl not to go to when she even said she has a lightbringer class and can help out in range. The author made the noble agree to his sensibilities because the author made it seem like she’s a weak beginner too. But then some chapters later the noble girl was apparently a badass that can fight of assassins and the like? Why did the noble girl not go to help fight the undead with her childhood friend? All for a pretty face? 

    Also this novel is blatant wish fulfillment. Not going to delve deep into that too much you got what you paid for.However, some worldbuilding does not make sense. Apparently you can buy ranks by buying essence with money. There is this one character that is your typical arrogant rich noble who lost a bet to the MC and apparently lost a fortune worth of contribution points because of that bet. Why in the world is the nobles in the world not increasing their ranks with money? Someone should at least comment on why not every noble student with old money has not done so already. 

    I kind of got baited by the reviews in royalroad which stated the MC knows what it’s like to be an outcast so he goes out of his way to make everyone included and befriends the lonely. We have that sort of but from what I seen so far the MC does so only after his god gives him a quest to help the misfortunate. I never seen him do so with his own volition. I am probably nitpicking and you can construe that it’s the same thing with the same results but the intention matters. Magnanimous hero or opportunist? Is he helping the misfortunate only for the quest rewards or he’s helping because he wants to because he knows what it’s like to be an ugly outcast? Why not both...? Lol, again I am nitpicking. I guess I am tryjng to find a reason to hate the MC because of the so much blatant wish fulfillment. I mean he even tried to weasly marry a noble damsel just to be protected by other noble families going after him! This wouldn’t be a problem in the first place if you followed society and still have your peasant sensibilities to know to treat nobles with respect. I never seen the MC demure or give face to a noble once even though he is a peasant. I guess he’s ascendant now so he’s no longer a peasant and apart of the high society but the author doesn’t even mention the class dichotomy of his word building and makes us the readers go confused and assume the cliche. 

    All in all it’s a good popcorn read if your into wish fulfillment and turn your brain off but I dropped it around chapter 30 due to the inconsistencies.

      Answering point by point, below. Given the details of the story being discussed, please be warned that both the points and my comments are very spoilery.

      That said,

      &#x200B;

      >Why did the noble girl not go to help fight the undead with her childhood friend? All for a pretty face?

      To maintain her cover. She was attempting to get a scion from a very shady noble house to court her at the time. This came out in-story, perhaps after the point /u/WISHFULFILLMENTSUCKS (user name checks out) stopped reading.

      &#x200B;

      >Why in the world is the nobles in the world not increasing their ranks with money? Someone should at least comment on why not every noble student with old money has not done so already.

      The fortune in points the MC obtains is enough to get him from Rank 3 to Rank 5, at which point, it's spent. Wealthy people do, in fact, spend their points like this, but the cost quickly becomes restrictive. Also, training up skill ranks is enormously important, and generally best done while increasing class rank by defeating monsters or completing quests. Harold's life is apparently under constant threat, so he has opted to rank up immediately to improve his chances.

      The protagonist's attitude toward nobility isn't very respectful, and it absolutely comes back to bite him. The entire reason he's an Ascended is his justifiable contempt for others who think they're his betters enraging him to the point where he punched a godstone. Being spiteful toward his betters when they give him attitude isn't rational, and certainly is self-sabotaging. At the same time, I suspect the reason his goddess has been so kind to him is that she wants him to humble those who have it coming.

    My absolute favorite monster MC and one of my more favorite litrpgs is the Japanese light novel series So I’m a Spider, So What? The MC is very personable and quite competent despite being silly at times, which is real nice compared to all the stupid decisions and casual nature(despite the supposed life or death situations) a lot of other series has. She has to eat disgusting monsters and even her siblings, and you can really see her struggle, growth, and the danger of the situations. There’s a lot to her character, especially as she changes throughout the story and through certain changes and events, like her torturous training to grind up her abilities, how she accepts and views killing, and even her interactions, or lack of social skills, and how she has to justify to herself about caring for others.

    And it has one of my favorite litrpg Systems. It’s nothing unique or mindblowing, but the way it’s integrated to the story and universe is really well done, because it’s there for an important reason. It plays into the mystery real well, with a lot of the more mysterious skills like n % I = W or Taboo having meaning and being teased throughout the volumes. It’s by far my favorite monster MC and isekai series. There’s also an anime of it currently airing, but it doesn’t really do the serious story or litrpg elements justice, and uh, the animation isn’t the best. Decent though.
    ```

  - u/MagmaDrago:
    ```
    Only two of these has a litRPG element but if you can overlook that then –

    - [Crystal Society](http://crystal.raelifin.com/)
      Follows an AI, Face, (whose Purpose is to "understand and gain the adoration of all humans") housed in a single body with multiple other AI each having their own purpose. The book did a very good job at depicting the AIs, Face in particular (she is the MC after all). It dips a bit in the second half but it's pretty good overall. The book is the first of a larger series but I haven't read the sequels: one, because I... kinda forgot it existed, and two, because the sequels don't hold up that well apparently.
    - [The Great Core's Paradox](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40888/the-great-cores-paradox)
      Description and the first chapter should give you an idea of what to expect. We are 254 pages in and not much of significant note has happened yet though the writing flows well and it feels much shorter than that as a result. The POV of a dungeon minion who regards its creator as more akin to God and sometimes has faith problems is also rather interesting to read. My only complaint is how our snek seems to live through situations when the writing makes it seem like it should be dead on its tails. They can be rationalised somewhat but yeah.
    - [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion)
      Shapeshifting bioweapon gains unintentioned sapience and escapes into the wider world which apparently has superheroes. And supervillains. The story isn't a pit of despair and tension like _Worm_ but it's no lighthearted romp either. The writing is a bit bland but the memorable characters, especially the MC, make up for it. A warning though, author updates irregularly and the story has been on hiatus for the last few months.
    - [Everbody Loves Large Chests](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/8894/everybody-loves-large-chests)
      Completed litRPG story following a >!mimic!< who becomes much, _much_ more over the course of the story. Read at least until the start of the elven city arc and maybe a few afterwards. It slowly becomes more of the same except on a few occasions.
    - [The Last Angel](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-last-angel.244209/)
      Multi-POV, sci-fi space opera mixing horror with epicness. Characters consist of one very angry AI, >!a bunch of humans and one alien,!< who has been exacting retribution (more like bloodying their nose) on a theological space empire who nearly wiped out humanity — her creator — a few centuries ago. Very atmospheric with top-notch writing. Red One, the AI, just has that slight touch of inhumanness and madness that really sold me on her as a non-human lead.

    **Edit:** Right, forgot these two.

    - [OCTO](https://zalbert.net/octo/)
      Hard sci-fi xenofiction with horror elements. I won't say more except it has been recommended here a few times before and in one thread dealing with Outside Context Problems which is how I found it. >!It follows the alien for the first half but then shifts POV, so there's that.!<
    - I'd be remiss if I didn't mention [Blindsight](https://www.rifters.com/real/Blindsight.htm) by Peter Watts. (The whole book is free!) While it doesn't follow an in-human lead, it does deal with first contact with aliens that are truly aliens. And it has vampires; biologically explained ones. Now, who doesn't love those?

    I extent recommendations for the next two a bit hesitantly since I personally enjoy them and don't know how well they would hold up to scrutiny, but here they are –

    - [Summon Imp!](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33295/summon-imp)
      Journey of a demon (current young) that gets summoned to other worlds, each running on its own rules, and gets PTSD from being killed repeatedly. Well, the last one is not entirely accurate but yes, it's a thing and that makes me happy. The beginning is rough since the author wanted to show us baby MC but it gets better. The worldbuilding, especially in regards to summoning mechanics, raises a lot of questions that I hope get answered beyond 'lol magic' (there hasn't been any yet and I hope that continues). Anyhow, writing is rough around the edges but the story has a lot of potential. This story has also not been updated for a month due to the author's medical issues.
    - [Outlands](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/12557/outlands)
      Wonderful writing, amazing atmosphere, characterisation that can leave a bit wanting, and plot that stumbles here and there but I very much enjoyed it overall. Story is complete.

    I would also de-rec _Shade Touched_ since there was not one chapter where I felt that MC was a peculiarly smart beast rather than a normal human with heightened curiosity, and maybe empathy, stuffed inside of an animals body. MC whining about that every same observation multiple times helped endear her to me even less.
    ```

- u/incamaDaddy:
  ```
  I've been really enjoying [The Way Ahead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42202/the-way-ahead), I think the system in this story is one of the closest to being rational in the whole LitRPG genre next to The Daily Grind even if a lot of people (not me) seem to dislike the narrative style. I'm looking for either completed or ongoing (no hiatus or dropped pls) stories with similar systems, I don't mind if they are published or web novels but the longer the better. and assume I already know anything commonly recommended here or listed in top web fiction.
  ```

  - u/MagmaDrago:
    ```
    What is it that makes a system rational for you?
    ```

    - u/incamaDaddy:
      ```
      the problem with most litRPG's is that their systems assign meaningless numbers to things like strength, dexterity, or hp and then fail to accurately depict what that means or keep things consistent. in the way ahead there are no levels, the system is based on skills and achievements. your class is not an archetype of abilities you can get but a system label for the sum of your skills and paths. or in the daily grind, upgrades are not something like +1 agility but +14m/s\^2 to acceleration, and we get to see a more accurate depiction of what that would do. and spoiling a bit of what happens further into the story >!when the second dungeon does give things like +1 accuracy, we see how that vagueness results in an overall improvement to everything related to the concept of accuracy!<. In any case, I don't think any of these systems are rational but they take a more rational approach to describing what a character can do.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        The problem with that amount of specificity is similar to the reasons authors don't generally give the reader specific amounts of money a character has, or makes an entirely new language to use for character dialogue. 

        &#x200B;

        While moderately interesting to a few people at the end of the day it doesn't actually matter and the amount of effort required to do so is too high for the minimal benefits.

        &#x200B;

        In my view you'd just avoid litrpgs, and system based stories if you don't like how systems are portrayed in them. There are millions of books out there, and just as many if not more webnovels around. If you're planning on writing a system based story, want more inspiration or is doing research sure. Otherwise just avoid things you don't particularly like, there are more things for you to read out there that you'll like than you'll ever be able to read.
        ```

        - u/echemon:
          ```
          The way the system (and the resulting metagame) is set up in the world depicted, people become superpowered in a small set of activities; a specific set of activities forms an implicit class; societally defined occupations/classes are restricted (in the particular empire the main character's in right now) to specific builds.  Seems pretty interesting.
          ```

        - u/incamaDaddy:
          ```
          the thing is that I do enjoy litrpgs in general. for example, I like the Azarinth healer just fine even though the system is absolutely meaningless and the story, in general, is at best a popcorn read. but I do enjoy better thought-out systems more and that's why I ask if someone knows any more that fit my criteria. Hell, I'm not even asking that they be as specific as the daily grind's, the system from the way ahead goes the completely opposite direction, I just ask for systems that actually succeed at depicting something consistently. so no offense, but going if you don't like them don't read them is not a useful answer.
          ```

          - u/fassina2:
            ```
            My main point was mostly talking about why high specificity is rarely seen, because that's interesting to me, and that imho looking for stories that have that trait is akin to looking for 'bad' stories from amateur writers. 

            Who often write mundane, plotless, follow along stories with glacial pacing. 

            Now I can see that what you want is not necessarily meaningless information, but rather a well thought out power / magic system. I agree with you, those are desirable and a sign of good writing.

    - u/Missing_Minus:
      ```
      Prior Note: I haven't watched DxD and only had vague knowledge of it previously. It was understandable what was happening though. This is obviously mild spoilers.  
      I didn't *dislike* this, but it felt like the story was spiraling towards the end. The main character early on is rather capable and dedicated (though focusing seemingly entirely on martial ability rather than knowledge, aka no making explosives at the home), and takes the chances they're given to uncover magical knowledge. At first the descriptions of the >!World Script!< are interesting, but as the story progresses its essentially a "main character spends several hours, and then they do whatever they want". We hear some hints early on of others using it, but no one except a single ally (>!Pua!<; >!Ignoring the ending stuff of first book, but that's essentially outside of focus and affect on story!<) bothers learning it. None of the enemies do, despite the extreme capabilities it brings. Sure, she's a very dedicated person, but she is also human. Seeing some of the higher-tier beings even think about using it would be interesting. It essentially feels like a cheat ability.  
      More egregious is the main character getting even worse at planning as the story progresses.  
      Another aspect is that it.. doesn't really give much character to everyone else. Obviously spoilery examples: >!Early on, MC is justifiably annoyed + wary of whatever-his-name-is main-character of DxD. Author notes that they plan on making him not entirely stupid. That never really happens, and he serves purely as a person to insult whenever he appears. There was an opportunity for some actual interaction with him being trained by MC, but that got skipped.!<; >!Rias is mostly there to be 'what the hell are you doing', but does have more (existing?) characterization than DxD-MC. This gets tedious after a bit.!<; >!Sota seems to be almost entirely there as a love interest? Like, she enjoys chess, and something about being romanced by whoever beats her in chess.!<; >!Pua was more interesting than others, but still felt kinda flat in that all she does is really help main character and a few bits about protecting her village.!<; >!Sarah has a good chunk of time early on, but mainly serves as that normal person she knows. There was some potentially actually interesting interaction between the MC's murderous attitude and Sarah's more moral perspective, but its just ignored as they drift apart.!<  
      Despite this negative review, I didn't dislike the story. The problems with it are: not really rational; bad characterization; MC is lauded for planning ability but she jumps into things without planning more and more as the story goes on; and cheat powers that should have been picked up by some remotely interested supernatural at least five centuries ago. I probably won't be reading too much of the second book, but that's more of not really liking Naruto than thinking the story isn't worth reading. I just wish the story managed to be more than what it is, because it could be excellent.
