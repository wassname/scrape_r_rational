  Unrelated to the chapter, but I just got why the image for Thou Shalt is a necklace with a pair of fangs: they're Learn's.

  I feel that Learn gotta fail here. He doesn't have the academic baseline, having prioritized learning about dwarven society rather than magic, and he doesn't seem inclined to cheat.

    My understanding was that he learned a baseline of everything and philosophy came last.

    Edit: such as he could anyway. We don't really know how much advantage a Command like Learn gives in it's chosen area. Tasked mages are mentioned as being the strongest a couple times in this chapter. Seems relevant.
