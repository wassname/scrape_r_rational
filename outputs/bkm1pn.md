## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  All humans have the ability to plane shift to alternate versions of Earth, subject to the following restrictions.

  * Each person has exactly two planes that they can plane shift to.  The first is the plane of their birth.  The second is a personal plane unique to that individual.
  * Each personal plane contains an alternate version of the world, identical to ours except that sapient humans never evolved.
  * When a person plane shifts, they can bring people and items with them, so long as they are in physical contact with all items being transported, and the total amount being transported is less than one ton of material.
  * Performing a plane shift requires significant effort, equivalent to about an hour of physical labor.

  Standard fantasy safety measures apply as follows.

  * Plane shifting occurs relative to surface of Earth, or the nearest celestial body as applicable.
  * Plane shifting will place a person at ground level, at rest relative to the surface.
  * Plane shifting will not place any transported objects inside of solid or liquid.
  * Plane shifting swaps the contents of a physical volume, preventing vacuum booms.

  What cultural changes would take place as a result of this ability at various points throughout history?

    Keeping anyone captive becomes almost impossible; societies wouldn't be able to use jails or prisons.

    Similarly, physical barriers and fortifications will be very different if anyone can travel from their birth plane to their personal plane, walk past where a wall would be, and travel back, like a 10-minute teleportation.

    You might like to have a look at Charles Stross's Merchant Princes series, it involves a similar powerset and does a good job of exploring the implications.

    Here's a few possible ways to maintain a secure location:

    * Keep it on your personal plane and never bring anyone there. If you die, it becomes inaccessible.
    * Keep it on your personal plane, use conventional barriers, and ensure that nobody gives birth there.
    * Make it impossible to plane shift into using the safety measures: away from any celestial body, above or below ground level (justifies wizard's towers and dungeons), inside a body of liquid (use scuba tanks or drain the location when you need to access it), or moving at high speeds (constantly moving train vaults? centrifuge vaults?)

    This could lead to the development of an aristocracy based on birth location: if a personal plane is settled and the person who it belonged to dies, only those born there would be able to leave the plane and return to it. They could ensure the security of their fortifications by forcing everyone else to give birth in an aristocrat's personal plane before being brought back, so that anyone else who shifts planes will be unable to return.

    If everyone's personal plane is an identical copy of the same alternate earth, natural resources become much less of an issue: locations in the personal plane with the most accessible resources will be mapped and become centres of industry. If someone finds a vein of iron in their personal plane, they can return to their birth plane, tell their friends the location, and their friends will find the same vein of iron in their own plane.

      > Keeping anyone captive becomes almost impossible; societies wouldn't be able to use jails or prisons.

      Absolutely.  I think that punishments would veer toward being either more or less humane than imprisonment, with nothing in-between.  If it is something that could be immediately identified and sentenced, then physical punishment is possible.  If the person can be immediately identified, then they could have fines imposed, since their goods/household would take longer to move.

      > This could lead to the development of an aristocracy based on birth location: if a personal plane is settled and the person who it belonged to dies, only those born there would be able to leave the plane and return to it. They could ensure the security of their fortifications by forcing everyone else to give birth in an aristocrat's personal plane before being brought back, so that anyone else who shifts planes will be unable to return.

      Correct, planes could be entirely cut off from each other.  I hadn't thought of a plane managing security by requiring all births to be performed off-plane, but that would make sense.

      > If everyone's personal plane is an identical copy of the same alternate earth, natural resources become much less of an issue

      That is correct, natural resources are in the same locations across all planes.  This makes precious metals be much less precious, as surface-level deposits that on our Earth were exhausted in antiquity are readily available.

    Ideas not entirely dissimilar to this were explored in Baxter and Pratchett's Long Earth books. A warning before anyone gets their hopes up - the books are much more Baxter's style then they are Pratchett's, IMO. If you've liked any of Baxter's other stuff, the might be worth a shot - if you're thinking about reading them on the strength of Pratchett's name instead, you're likely to be disappointed.

    Anyways, in those books you could travel to alternative realities in two different 'directions', each of which contained Earths that were slightly different but without humans when the story begins. The alternative realities are shared, not individualized. The story begins with the invention of a device that allows the majority of humanity to do this dimensional travelling cheaply and easily. The number of alternative realities in each 'direction' is extremely large and not known when the story begins.

    The books are pretty decent about exploring how this radically reshapes human society.

      If you prefer Pratchett's writing more, the series is based on his short story The High Meggas, which I found far more fascinating. I felt the same way you did about the Long Earth series, and gave up on it halfway through the second book.

    How long does it take to plane shift? It is equivalent to one hour of physical labor, but does it actually take 1 hour to charge up the plane shift, during which time you must always remain in contact with all items and people? 

    Also, can you plane shift to your worlds even if you were plane shifted to someone else's personal plane? That's probably important to prevent plane shift kidnapping.

    Furthermore, what does the following mean exactly?

    > Each personal plane contains an alternate version of the world, identical to ours except that sapient humans never evolved. 

    Are these worlds going to be full of giant predators that now didn't go extinct because of humans? Full of jungles with unknown plants? Full of bacteria, viruses and parasites that our immune systems have never seen? That sounds rather dangerous to enter by yourself. And also an easy way for people to kill everyone by going to their personal plane, contracting some never-seen-before plague, and returning to the plane of their birth. Cultural changes will then involve tons of people dying to plagues and a few safe bunkers under total reverse quarantine that are in highly inaccessible places to prevent people from plane shifting in. Like deep underground or underwater or in space.

      >How long does it take to plane shift? It is equivalent to one hour of physical labor, but does it actually take 1 hour to charge up the plane shift, during which time you must always remain in contact with all items and people?

      About 5 minutes, during which you need to maintain contact.

      >Also, can you plane shift to your worlds even if you were plane shifted to someone else's personal plane? That's probably important to prevent plane shift kidnapping.

      Yes.  No matter what plane a person is on, they can always plane shift to their birth/personal planes.  The restrictions are only on the destination, not on the departure location.

      > Are these worlds going to be full of giant predators that now didn't go extinct because of humans? Full of jungles with unknown plants?  Full of bacteria, viruses and parasites that our immune systems have never seen?

      Predators, yes, along with any plants that were driven extinct by humans.  Bacteria/viruses/parasites that are adapted to humans would be less common, as they wouldn't have any native humans to infect.

      > That sounds rather dangerous to enter by yourself.

      Quite so, apart from brief expeditions for resources, or for dumping waste.  I imagine that there could be colonization pushes, with a slow building of structures/farms on one person's personal plane, followed by emigration.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        >Bacteria/viruses/parasites that are adapted to humans would be less common, as they wouldn't have any native humans to infect.

        Are there no apes or early primitive humans around? Even if there weren't, there are a lot of plagues that start in animals and somehow get transferred to humans because our physiology is close enough.

        But let's look at the crime aspect instead of the disease aspect. Plane shift kidnapping doesn't work, and criminals can't be kept in normal prisons since they can just plane shift, move out of the prison's location, and plane shift back. Which means special prisons would be needed, like prisons on zeppelins or prisons in the ocean, that way plane shifting is death. These prisons would cost way more, so I imagine that there will be a strong shift in cultural perceptions towards favoring cheap capital punishments.

        But before that, how would one catch a criminal? It only takes 5 minutes for them to escape to their personal plane, and if they are born on your plane they can return at any time, bringing with them drugs or bombs or whatever they please. Every person born on a plane is effectively a potential near-unstoppable villain for that plane. Which means that in order to have safe planes, one must impose laws where every baby is born off-plane except for a few heavily monitored exceptions for the purpose of bringing people into this plane.

        Countries would also invest in building safe bunkers that criminals cannot plane-shift into, otherwise they could plane shift a bomb in, plane shift out, and the area gets destroyed by the bomb. Fortunately, a person can only plane shift to ground level, so building underground bunkers would work well. Ground level rooms can also be made secure by half-filling them with water, so people cannot plane-shift into the liquid water.

          For most of those diseases, they jumped from livestock to humans simply because of how much opportunity there was for the jump to take place. 

          Also, rather than water, it would probably be more useful to use something like styrofoam or some other similar light material. Or have a bunch of strings hanging from the ceiling. Much easier to contain.

    Physical security is wiped out. Walk up to a locked door, shift, walk past where the door isn’t, shift back.

    You can’t really use personal planes to get around that, beyond a certain point, because if you put the gold in Sgt Bilko’s personal plane, and he dies, it’s all gone.

    You can’t easily colonize a personal plane for the same reason... it’s like you’re going to a new planet. Children born in the colony can only come back to Earth by hitching a ride on returning Earthfolk, though a pool of colonist children can serve to relay people to the new world and come back with one of their passengers. Kind of like in Haldemann’s *Mindbridge*.

    Unpopular worlds might end up permanently lost, once the original opener dies.

    >identical to ours except that sapient humans never evolved.

    I think, with respect to the Far Future of that world, the most relevant fact that we need to understand is whether the starting map of the other plane increments with age (e.g. do two newborns a thousand years apart get the same pre-human template of a plane? Or does the later newborn get an "updated" plane of a thousand years later?)

    If it's the latter....this society is eventually going to have a big problem as the template world degrades and eventually becomes uninhabitable, or evolves intelligence of it's own.

    But as for the near term...

    >What cultural changes would take place as a result of this ability at various points throughout history?

    -Due to every new-born having an entire planet, compulsory agriculture never happens. People will just hunt and gather in their ever-expanding plane-worlds forever. Going by modern hunter gatherers, and considering that this world would be *even more lush* than that, it would have been extremely easy for any lone adult to sustain themselves *and* 1-2 other persons through hunting and gathering. Humans are ridiculously effective as natural organisms even with stone age technology...and then consider that eventually they will invent technology *anyway* and come into this lush world hunting with guns and such. (Unless they don't bother inventing tech until they're hungry, in which case they'll be hunter gatherers forever...but I doubt that)

    -Since anyone can secede from any thing at any time, most of society exists as an anarchist's vision of utopia (though pockets of psychological control and aggressiveness may exist, it would be hard for them to affect anyone who isn't already inside of it)

    -Some planes, especially the one where humans evolved and where the power started, will be default hubs. They may eventually become a bit crowded, but that's more or less okay (for us) because it doesn't really effect humanity if we destroy the ecology in those planes. Within those planes, scarcity over hub-resources begin to take hold to some degree, although this will ultimately be solved by anchoring additional hub planes together. 

    -By default, a plane is lost when a person dies. If society wishes to prevent plane loss, two planes can be "anchored" together by sending people to be born in them, then having the progenitor of that plane send them back. Those people can then take additional newborns to their "birth plane". In effect each plane can maintain a population of people who have been born in the other plane.

    -two planes can "secede" forever by preventing the sending of new babies to be born in the other plane, preventing the incoming of new babies born on the other plane, committing genocide upon, or forcing out everyone who was born on the other plane, since there will then be no way for anyone to go to that plane and bring new immigrants. (Easy fodder for plot drama, as it would be easy for one or two people to be the "last link" between hub planes.). 

    -I imagine most conflict in this world would center around right of access to important planes, as most things humans usually fight over are no longer an issue. It would be incredibly easy for any individual or group who was sufficiently motivated to not want to be part of a conflict to escape from it (perhaps at the cost of losing access to an important plane), so most fighting would be between motivated combatants.

      > If it's the latter....this society is eventually going to have a big problem as the template world degrades and eventually becomes uninhabitable, or evolves intelligence of it's own.

      The personal planes do age along with the original.  On astronomy time scales, this will become an issue in about 1 billion years, when the sun's increase in power output raises the global temperature significantly.

      > -Due to every new-born having an entire planet, compulsory agriculture never happens. People will just hunt and gather in their ever-expanding plane-worlds forever.

      I'm not sure on this one, since to my knowledge the transition to agriculture happened in order to have a more steady supply of food, not to increase the total amount of food available.  Hunting/gathering provides more food on average, but runs more risk of famine.

      > -I imagine most conflict in this world would center around right of access to important planes, as most things humans usually fight over are no longer an issue.

      Agreed.  Land would no longer be a primary resource, though developed land still would be.  While a person could leave their home dimension at any time, it would require leaving behind much of the infrastructure that their home dimension provides.

     * if #2 is "sophonts / life can exist in alternate versions" and #3 is "yes", then default Earth eventually gets destroyed (e.g. pandemics, “alien” WMDs, etc); or becomes a hub connecting multitude dimensions of sentient species; and/or becomes an extremely tightly controlled territory with draconian laws and regulations.
    * if #6 is "yes", then general security measures and protocols are very different from ours.

      >1\. For how long did humans as a species have this ability?

      There exists a threshold of intelligence, above which any creature has this ability.  For humans, this occurred after socialization, but before the development of agriculture.

      >2\. What does the "no evolution of sapient humans" description mean, more exactly? Is it only the H. sapiens species, all the apes, anything humanoid, anything sentient, anything alive, etc?

      The other great apes still exist in the personal planes, but are all below the threshold of intelligence necessary to have the ability to plane shift.  The history in personal planes proceeded as in the same manner as ours, except that any newborn that would be above this threshold of intelligence was never born.

      >3\.Can things be brought back from personal dimensions to the default one?

      Yes.  Resources can be brought through any plane shift.

      >4\.What happens when c_B is born in c_C’s unique dimension? Does c_C’s unique dimension become c_B’s default one and c_B’s unique one two degrees of separation away from the global default dimension?

      That is correct, c_C's unique dimension is the home dimension of c_B.  c_B can plane shift into that dimension, and into her own unique dimension.  c_C cannot travel to the global default dimension, except by being transported by another person.

      >5\.What happens if char_A transports a group of people to her dimension, then dies for whatever reason? Does the group get irreversibly stuck in c_A’s dimension?

      c_A's dimension and anyone in it continue to exist independent of c_A's death.  The group that was transported can, at any time, return to their birth dimension or their personal dimension.  The limitations are only on the destination.  That does mean, though, that unless somebody else was born in c_A's dimension while they were there, it would be possible to lose access entirely.

      > * can people give their unique "keys" to others, swap "keys", etc?

      No.  There is no way to gain the ability to plane shift to any additional planes.  That said, while individuals could not, groups of people over long periods of time could by strategically choosing the birth dimension of their children.  For example, trading families across dimensions might ensure that they have sufficient children born in each dimension they trade with that disease would be unlikely to disrupt trade.

      >6\.What happens if someone performs a journey like this A→A’, A’→B’, B’→B? Does it look to others like a teleportation with a delay in default dimension?

      That is correct.  Physical travel across a different dimension would appear as if it were delayed teleportation.

      > (important for the DM and players but rhetorical to me) does the research / experimentation regarding this dimension-hopping ability bear any results and answers?  does magic exist? Its capabilities, limitations, etc.  are laws of nature the same in the parallel universes?  is there a time dilation effect between parallels?

      The laws of nature exist the same in all parallel universes, with no time dilation.  Magic does not exist, though some of the rules of plane shifting may be relaxed through advanced research.  For example, being able to travel to the birth plane of any creature, not just sapient creatures.

    Hopefully this doesn't retread a lot of what people have already answered with.

    **Prisons**

    Prisons become completely impractical. Shifting automatically to ground/sea level makes it very hard to keep someone from escaping a hazardous cell. While initially people might think to build huge prison complexes on artificial islands, deserts, or other places prisoners wouldn't be able to survive shifting to, all it would take is one disgruntled individual to pull 1 ton of prison with them and effectively break everyone else out. (This is assuming you can shift parts of an item with you)

    The only way it could work would be if A) the preparation to plane shift can be reliably detected and B) it can be disrupted, in which case you could have prisoners outfitted with taser collars to shock them if it detects and imminent shift.

    **Security**

    Keeping people out of things would be difficult, but at least not impossible. Security would be focused on keeping person-sized spaces from existing in secure areas when not in use, which could be done by lowering layers of mesh netting from the ceiling. Safes, depending on how discrete your material must be when shifting, would either have to be done away with entirely if someone can telefrag the door off, or be attached to building foundations to prevent them from being phased out.

    Personal security would be a great deal more concerning. Phase-kidnapping would be a real problem when people can hold a finger to someone's shoulder while they're asleep and spirit them away 5 minutes later. Sleeping in general would become a scary activity, and sleeping in public would be taboo.

    **Crime**

    We could expect there to be a huge uptick in missing persons reports, since anyone who kills anyone now has a guaranteed way to hide a body. Serial killers would be a lot harder to catch. People would probably be a lot more okay with surveillance, cell phone tracking, and so on in light of that constant risk. Ironically, we would likely see a lot less poaching, as any hunter now has an entire world of untouched population up for grabs.

    Aside from morbid crimes, petty theft would be on the rise. Big box stores would have to change their entire business model, more goods being stored behind glass and more display models only, with inventory being held in the back.

    **World Colonization**

    While I do think "Earth prime" (E) would continue to be a centralized hub for mankind, rich individuals and corporations would certainly create "private world networks" to their own benefit. They would begin with a single person transporting people and resources to their private plane (E' or F), full time, funded by some billionaire. When they have a settlement running, the generation of people born there will have F (and some F') as their phase worlds. Now, while the original person who had E and F as their phase worlds will eventually die, as long as you have a small population of people born to E and F stationed in the opposite world, you have continuous travel between them.

    For example, given that a person's name starts with their native world, you have Edward and Fawn on world E, and Edith and Frank on world F. As long as you have E&F natives travelling in pairs between worlds, there will always be someone that can keep that connection active no matter what world they are on.

    These worlds, I imagine, would mainly be used for resource mining, waste dumps, fast travel, and tourism. Since they require people to work, acting as a "world courier" would be a steady form of employment to many people. Eventually, population growth would begin to accelerate exponentially and economic growth would be limited only by the amount of people able to act as world couriers as industries become more and more efficient at extracting resources from worlds and shipping them back in 1 ton increments, and society enters a more or less utopian age thanks to an infinite amount of resources to extract.

  What would be some efficient chains of actions in a sudden global LitRPG-fication scenario if the character had to be making decisions with very limited information about the new system (e.g. no manuals, no "guides" written by others, no time travel knowledge, etc)? Some examples:

  * what if the specialisation they’ve ended up deciding on (wizard, melee, ranged, etc), turned out to be very weak or even disadvantageous in later game "stages"? 
  * Or they decided to gather information and experiment before acting and it turned out that the quickest to act won the most?
  * or they decided to become a party- or village- player, and it turned out that the larger a group was the more likely it would be to get attacked and destroyed, etc.

  In stories this problem rarely comes up because, well, the author has already designed what the game setting is going to be like, and they only have to more-or-less believably describe how the protagonist ends up making the "clever" initial set of choices.
  ```

  - u/meterion:
    ```
    Well, it's just like you said: without an author guiding a character to an ideal/clever build, there's no practical way to decide on an ideal path because a litRPG mechanics world could have any kind of mechanic that screws over any strategy you might come up with. Realistically, the best you can hope for is commit to specialization(s) that seems to synergize well and hope you're not picking a dud.

    Beyond that, your best bet is to try to test if any low-hanging fruit from whatever litRPGs you personally know are exploitable, like:

    * combing whatever HUD/game interface you have (if any) for wordings that give you information about the game, like "0 unallocated stat points" meaning there's a way to raise arbitrary stats, or if there's a skill store, overworld map, etc
    * whether stats can be "trained" like weightlifting for STR, and if there's a diminishing return on it like so many Gamer stories
    * if skills can be created in the same way
    * try to meditate to unlock your MP or concentrate really hard on something to unlock appraisal (lol)
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

    > Or they decided to gather information and experiment before acting and it turned out that the quickest to act won the most? 

    This actually makes a lot of sense though. In most RPGs, once you're ahead of the pack, you tend to stay that way. The XP-rich become XP-richer because they can do more things that will get them more loot and XP and make them more OP to grab more loot in an endless cycle. Even if you don't maliciously stomp on those weaker than you, the very act of killing the stronger monsters means less killable monsters available for the people behind you by the time they get to your level.

    So what's most important is getting a massive lead early on, which is what you see in many of these LitRPG stories: the MC discovers some powerful artifact or skillbook or whatever that puts them way ahead.

    With that goal in mind, first check whether indirectly setting things on fire gets you some form of XP.

    If so, set a forest on fire. If you're lucky, that counts as you killing everything in the forest and you become instantly overpowered. Just err, check that there aren't any elves who would then consider you public enemy #1.

    Conduct other kinds of experiments for mass killing methods. Can you divert a river to a cave dungeon and drown everything in it? Can you cause an avalanche on a mountain and kill everything below? Can you create tons of traps and get XP for every monster that falls in one? Can you create monster farms to farm up tons of XP?  Can you divert a river away from the lake it feeds into, wait for the lake to dry up, and then go in and trivially murder all the helpless lake monsters who are now feeble and dying from lack of water? The last one actually seems pretty doable for most RPG systems. There are all kinds of ways to conduct mass murder without knowing anything about actual combat.

  - u/Sonderjye:

    Well, the problem is that every system is different and you can't really make educated guesses, so the only real way is to gather information. Have a large number of people level up and see what they get, record the results and pass that down to future generations. This of course isn't possible when you are a lone person and there's a high lethality rate but work as an organization and you can have a truely optimized second generation team.

    It's important to research whether you can retrain/abandon your class.

    You would also expect that other organization are gathering class information so maybe if you got wealthy enough you can trade but you'd still need time for information gathering.

    You can try to find an edge or exploit the system but the only reliable way to do well would be to get as big a group as possible and have everyone go different paths. This let's you find unbalanced specializations faster and to carry those who got unlucky.

  A ROB puts a hypercomputer in your head. Its mental interface with you is capable of accepting any mental or sensory input, and writing to any part of you external to your mind. For example, it can capture video of what your eyes and your minds eyes see, and it can play back whatever it has recorded over your eyes, but not through your minds eyes. It also has a third output, which plays a similar role to your minds eye, while being separate from it. The manual indicates this is a limitation of the hardware.

  It comes with an operating system that can be rewound to any previous state, an operating manual explaining the low level specification of how it works and the computational model it runs on, and the source code and IDE's for popular programming languages extended to take advantage of the properties of the hypercomputer, such as real precision number libraries, no limitations regarding memory, and compatibility modes  for running code written in the regular version of the programming libraries.

  The interface for querying time returns a real precision number.

  When a scan is taken of your brain, you can see where it activates your neurons, but can find no sign of the hypercomputer itself. That is, while the interaction between you and the computer seems to take place completely in real space, there is no indication of how it is capable of reading or writing brain states, or how it performs it's computations. This is not addressed in the manual.

  What do the people of r/rational do with this computer?

    If I plug a usb cable into my ear, does the interface count as part of my body so the computer can interface with it? If so, you quickly gain access to existing software from the internet.

    If you want, you can produce as many bitcoins as you want. If you want to scale up and probably go public, you can provide cloud hypercomputing services, though I would suggest you vet the ones that existing supercomputers can't execute. If you want to scale up even further, you can hold the world hostage with the threat of running an unvetted AI. (Such as by locating the Turing machine that best predicts Wikipedia articles across our past, then asking it for Wikipedia articles from our future.) And to scale to the maximum, fund AI research to get the safer deal, using your hardware advantage to not worry about arms races overriding safety.

    What differences are there between this hypercomputer and a regular computer? Unlimited memory and precision is a plus, but most computers already have more memory and precision than you need. Also an internet connection so you can actually tell others about it. No point being precise to 3000 decimal places if the only way to transfer the data is for you to literally speak 3000 digits out one by one. Getting the exact time doesn't really seem meaningful either since by the time your brain has applied for or processed the information, an inexact amount of time has passed. Capturing video can be done with a regular computer as well.

    So rather than using the hypercomputer for its computing powers, I'm more interested in the fact that its literally linked to your sensory system. So unlike a VR device that can be forcefully taken off or damaged, this hypercomputer always has control over your senses. The question then is, does the hypercomputer have the power to overwrite your senses? For example, can you turn off your ability to feel pain with the hypercomputer? What about having the hypercomputer process input from your eyes, and modify the amount of light entering if it is too bright or too dark? Would you be able to render flashbangs completely useless by writing such programs?
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      Hypercomputers can perform infinite computations in finite periods of time. This lets you pull off funny tricks like simulating the computer inside itself or treating it like an oracle.

      Yeah, you can turn off your sense of pain.

      No, flashbangs will still fuck you up, because it physically overwhelms your senses. Your eyes have to physically reset after experiencing that, and your ears have to recover. They're not generating good and useful data.

      Yeah, you can do post processing on what's coming into your eyes, and you've effectively got eidetic memory, but there's limits to the signal/noise ratio.
      ```

        > No, flashbangs will still fuck you up, because it physically overwhelms your senses. Your eyes have to physically reset after experiencing that, and your ears have to recover. They're not generating good and useful data. 

        Rather than having the hypercomputer give you data after you are blinded, I was thinking more along the lines of preemptively writing a simple program that says something like "While light input > 100, do light input = light input - 10". So when your eyes are exposed to blinding light, the hypercomputer picks up on the brightness and immediately dims it to manageable levels. Would that work and thus stop flashbangs from affecting you?

        Also infinite computation? That sounds ridiculously exploitable. You can write a machine learning algorithm that has infinite clones and infinite iterations to basically solve any problem whose solution is machine learnable, under the restriction of limited data flow into and out of you. That means you can play chess perfectly regardless of board size and pieces, but that wouldn't even be scratching the surface of what your hypercomputer can do. You wouldn't quite be able to turn your hypercomputer into [Laplace's Demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace's_demon), but you can probably get much much closer than anyone ever has.
        ```

        - u/meterion:
          ```
          The flashbang problem is that your physical eyes are being damaged by the flash. The hypercomputer isn't capable of intercepting photons to your photoreceptors any more than your typical computer could intercept a surge current. By the time it detects it, the damage has already been done to your sensors.
          ```

        - u/CreationBlues:
          ```
          No, it can only read and set neural impulses. The first step of vision isn't a neural process, the first step is the bleaching of photosensitive proteins in the eye. What a flashbang does is activate all photoreceptive cells in the eye at once, leaving you completely blind for about 5 seconds. The cells that detect light are physically incapable of sending a signal, because the proteins responsible for detecting light are being regenerated.

          On the subject of machine learning and laplaces demon, you can do one better and instantiate [AIXI,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIXI) which probably wouldn't be very smart (especially if you try to be clever and use your mood as it's reward function) but would definitely lead to some interesting consequences.
          ```

          - u/RetardedWabbit:
            ```
            You could use the computer to use other receptors as light receptors to try to see. Use it to detect tiny changes in their firing due to light sources, filter out the background, and filter them by skin tone for color resolution. Getting different color tattoos would help with the color resolution, drastically different absorption rates for known colors. Use different levels of thickness for clothes as another contrast.

            You could also just avoid the flashbang? Get some basic image recognition going if flashbang=pulled,delay.brandfuse, then rolleyes into back of head until it goes off. Code it better to avoid mistakes and exploitation, but this should dramatically reduce the effects on your eyes

  you get a magic power: any book you touch, you can choose to add a copy to your personal library. you can summon or dismiss copies from your personal library at will. copies are the same as the original, including condition (wear, writing in margins, ect). 

  this only works on 'books', but is not limited to paper. you could copy a stone tablet, if it had enough writing carved into it. you must be able to recognize an item as a book for this to count, and there is a minimum amount of text needed to count as a book (a post-it note with one word is not a book, a stack of post it notes could be however). it takes a moment to copy, long enough to pick a book up, read the title, and set it back down. 

  so, whats the best use of this power?
  ```

  - u/Radioterrill:
    ```
    The book definition seems flexible enough that this could be used as a fairly generic matter duplication power. Maybe have a handheld laser cutter to etch a patch of minute text onto objects, or stick microdots to them? There's the usual free energy approaches, like summoning and dismissing a huge osmium tablet at a height to get kinetic energy, or maybe an uranium tablet for a nuclear power plant.

    It's also a natural fit for an archivist, I'm sure researchers would love having copies of ancient books that they could handle carelessly without having to worry about damage to the original.

    You could claim to be a master forger and phantom thief, dealing exclusively with books. All you need to do is touch the original and you can present your client with an identical copy.

    Can you copy a copy? Can you effectively generate infinite mass? Because I'm thinking of building another Earth.

    &#x200B;

    First construct a gigantic book on Earth prime that is full of useful materials like edible pages, words written in plant seeds, decorations made of precious metals, etc. Then copy the book. Summon out a copy of the book, and copy that copy. Then dismiss the first copy. Now you have two copies. Repeat over and over to get ridiculous amounts of copies stored away in your personal library.

    &#x200B;

    Now get on a rocket and head for the opposite side of Earth's orbit, moving at the same speed as Earth. Mass summon your copies of the book until gravity binds them together and voilà, Earth 2.0.

    Disclaimer: Ask your physicist if Earth 2.0 is right for you. Side effects include throwing other planets off their orbits and destroying all life on Earth Prime.

  Someone who thought Thanos's plan in Infinity War was a really great idea will encounter a one-wish genie in exactly two weeks. You know their name and home address, but because of your plot-derived Hero Complex™, you cannot kill or injure this person. 

  They will encounter the genie no matter what you do, your task is to convince them not to go through with killing half of the population. Bonus points if you explain how you would coerce them into using their wish for something more productive

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    > because of your plot-derived Hero Complex™, you cannot kill or injure this person. 

    Plan 1: Not even bind and gag them so they can't speak a wish? Because that seems like the simplest "non-violent" solution. It doesn't stop them from encountering the genie, since it could be thrown through the window to land in front of them or something. It just prevents them from making a wish.

    Plan 2: Does this target person know you have a Hero Complex™? Could you do a self-sacrificial villain bluff? Act like you're aiming to kill them, and laugh about their wish to kill only half the world, because that means a 50% chance of you living to kill them. Nudge them towards the idea of wishing for you to die instead of 50% of the population.

    Plan 3: Attempt to actually convince them with words and reason. Yuck. Attempt to tell them how killing 50% of the population would cripple the economy and result in them being unable to buy/steal anything because half the people producing the stuff and transporting it to stores are dead. Attempt to tell them how it would lead to anarchy and probably lead to their death. Such reasonable arguments are highly unlikely to work though, since if they were reasonable they wouldn't be wishing to kill 50% of the population.

  As I wrote this out, I realized it's pretty convoluted. Basically one of my villains is playing around with time while working for the people trying to catch her, and I want it to make sense for her to win in spite of hundreds of highly intelligent sociopaths trying to find and stop her. So what I need are things she can do with her time powers that are horribly broken, and ways others could conceivably stop her, given that she will see almost everything coming and has had a long time to prepare.

  She has the power to collect information from the future. This power is not super convenient to use, and does have limitations we will get to, but the chain goes like this: She has the power to read minds. Furthermore, she has subordinates who can see a few seconds into their own subjective future. She can also freeze time for these agents. Adding all this together, she can read these agents' minds and see what the future will be like by freezing them until the point in time she wants to look at.

  The problem this character faces is that she is working for an evil magical dictator who randomly and frequently reads her mind very thoroughly. She has a system in place to wipe her memory whenever she isn't working on treasonous plots, and has set up a bunch of triggers to give her back her memories and true motivations in situations where she is unlikely to have her mind read right this minute. This does leave her a bit of a mess with a horrible sense of not really having a core personality, since it gets ripped out all the time, but she's had high functioning Borderline Personality Disorder for decades, so those above her are used to her emotions and actions not always making perfect sense, or not knowing herself why she did x. She's very useful to them because she has rare powers, but at the end of the day they think she's just too damaged and pathetic to be any kind of criminal mastermind, never mind an apocalyptic threat at the core of their own power structure. They see her as a tool that is very easy to destroy if it turns against them. *And when she doesn't have her full memories and motivations, she genuinely agrees with this assessment.*

  I think I have things worked out fairly well, but I want to be sure I don't miss something obvious somebody should be doing if they are intelligent. This character is evil and wants to basically destroy civilization because of some plot stuff we don't need to get into. She also works at the highest levels of the magical science secret police and is tasked with sniffing out world ending threats, and the few people over her do not want to bring about any kind of apocalypse whatsoever.

  What she needs to accomplish to reach her very specific win condition is for the evil empire of Nazi Wizard Moria to believe that the world is going to end on x date *and they can't stop it*. She also needs to set things up so that she is allowed to be in charge of the last ditch Hail Mary efforts to help humanity survive the apocalypse. She cannot brute force anything, but she is extremely good at manipulating people and has no qualms about destroying lives. Now, this is what she has going for her:

  1) Can read minds fully

  2) Can look ~5 seconds into her own subjective future

  3) Has several subordinates who also have one of these powers.

  4) Prophetic powers resist mind reading in my world. Even if you have all the time in the world, you cannot read thoughts about the victim's own prophetic powers, nor can you see their visions. *But*, if you have the same power as someone *and* you can read minds, you can pierce this resistance. So she can pierce her own subordinates' resistances, but because nobody but her has both, *nobody* can read *her* thoughts and memories that directly touch on precognition and viewing the future.

  5) By freezing time for herself or her minions, she can look much further into the future, with no hard maximum

  6) By *thinking about* freezing time for herself, she can instantly make herself aware of simple things like how long it would take for someone to unfreeze her, how long it will take for anyone to come here if she never left the room, at what time does the enemy storm the fortress, etc

  7) Nobody else knows about 4, and nobody can read this information from her mind, because it pertains to prophetic powers

  8) She is the first person to figure out that they can extend the range of the power by freezing time, and she formulates her master plan before anyone else figures out this is possible.

  9) Her superiors think she's a pathetic shell of a person who lucked out and was born with some rare and useful powers, so she is not a suspect or considered a threat

  10) Because she is considered safe and useful, she ends up something like the 5th most powerful person in the empire, and can use secret police resources pretty much however she wants, as long as she can make it look like it's not a power play or actively treasonous after the fact

  11) Thousands of people with prophetic powers different from hers believe the world is going to end around date x as well, and prophetic powers are maddeningly unhelpful in trying to gleam any information on what the threat actually is

  The limitations she has to deal with:

  1) Her mind will be read fully pretty much every day, and on random occasion several times per day

  2) Her superiors, subordinates and pretty much everyone else are working pretty hard to stop the world from ending, they just don't know they have a traitor working against them

  3) For the last several years before the apocalypse, the people around her will also know that the precognition can be combined with freezing time. They just think she reported it the second she found out about it (Which agrees with her memories... Most of the time)

  4) You can change the future after having seen it, but that depends on *your* actions. You can't see what would happen if someone else, unrelated to your actions, decides to do something else. If you imagine freezing yourself to see what will happen in ten minutes, the future you see is the one in the world where you froze yourself and didn't go off to do anything else

  So, important things I have already decided to have her do:

  1) Arrange for the death of every single person in the world other than her who has both precognition *and* the ability to read minds. They are both really rare powers, and it's nearly unheard of for anyone to have both. Never the less, she looks *real* close for anyone who does and eliminates them.

  2) The empire knows toward the end that they can look further into the future by freezing time viewers in time, but they don't know that she and she alone can read these visions in others' minds. Therefore, she knows everything they have predicted about the future, but they don't know everything she has predicted.

  3) By commanding a mind reader to read her own mind after she freezes and unfreezes time for them, she can read the mind of her future self.

  4) By precommitting to make random things go poorly for those around her in timelines where things don't work out to her advantage, she makes the main players gravitate toward choosing futures she likes. For example, say the queens want to look at a potential future where they execute this or that powerful subject they have, just to see what happens, who is plotting against them or has skeletons in the closet, etc. She would have set up a dead man's switch for random things to go poorly if she were to die and stop undoing those plans. Think Voldemort in HPMOR setting up the Blood Fort sacrifice to murder hundreds of students, all the while planning to cancel the ritual as long as he wasn't stopped from doing so. By making it appear that things would get visibly worse if she died and stopped being a helpful non-threatening bureaucrat, she closes out futures where she is executed as a precaution.

  ...Geesh. That's a lot of information. So, is it believable for her to succeed with her plans here? This all happens hundreds of years before my books actually begin. In the first book, my characters end up isolated and stuck in the ruins of the capital of this empire, and figure out *some* of what happened there leading up to the apocalypse. And also, toward the end of the first book it becomes clear that she set a few things in motion that have yet to play out, even though she died hundreds of years ago.

  I want to make sure readers aren't annoyed and feel like this woman couldn't possibly have succeeded in sabotaging all the empire's efforts to avert the end of their civilization. So really, what I'm looking for is, after reading through all this, is there anything you can think of that I might have missed about how she is more vulnerable than I imagine her? Does this all have some weakness I didn't think of? And also just in general, given the powers involved here, is there any cool shit that should definitely be happening that it sounds like I missed?
  ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    Her superiors’ continuous treatment of her as a non-threat feels somewhat of an idiot ball behaviour. Especially with all the power at her disposal and all the incongruent actions they are witnessing from her. This flaw is partially mitigated by #III-4, but not enough to not make them partially feel like hollywood zombies for plot railroading (IMO). So maybe insert some additional circumstances that would allow for her to successfully mask herself for so long?

    And one thing I can think of her doing is trying to generate a self-fulfilling prophecy, brute-forcing variations of it until one of them shows in her visions to be powerful enough that once she broadcasts it in the master timeline it will captivate minds to a sufficient degree and start self-propagating until the vague-ish apocalypse prophesised by it can not help but be reenacted. I don’t know if this is a cliche solution though, or how well will it suit the rest of your plot and setting structure.
    ```

    - u/Rhamni:
      ```
      She does have her mind read at least once a day, so that's part of why she never comes under suspicion. She also has a long history of mental illness - she was raised up because a lot of people thought "Oh man, what a shell of a person... But you know, I could really make use of those powers of hers..." When she isn't aware of her true motives, she has almost no direction in her life other than trying to be helpful to the people who raised her up, and wanting to feel like she's helping to protect civilization from the mysterious apocalyptic threat everyone is trying to put a stop to. It also helps that she genuinely hates one of the enemies of the country, and that prophecies seem to suggest this particular enemy will be some kind of trigger for the disaster. So anything big she does that she can play off as being a move against that enemy is seen as both more believable *and* her trying to help.

      As for prophecy manipulation, I didn't get into that in my first post because it's a whole other kettle of fish and gets quite complicated as well, but suffice it to say, she's got that covered. Destiny and prophecy can indeed be tinkered with and heavily abused under the right circumstances. The apocalypse she is working toward is 'supposed' to happen, and things go her way a little more easily because of it. Everyone else is trying to push giant boulders up a hill, while she just has to push them off course so they roll back down again. The power of destiny is not so strong that it's 'easy' so long as it favours you, and I hope I'll be able to show that as well, since it has some important limitations, but it's certainly an advantage to be working with it and not against it.

      Thank you very much for your input! I realize that I'm only showing a small part of the plot and that that makes it harder to give feedback, but it's useful never the less. Thanks for your time.
