  God I love sassy Cat.  Tyrant really brings out the best in her.

    ```
    > We're not made of goats

    10/10 banter. There wasn't enough of it last arc.
    ```

  Does anyone know what Theodosius’ Dilemma is?

    This epigraph is my guess:
    > A hundred battles, even victories, will always lose you the war.
    ```

      So basically Calernia's version of a pyrrhic victory.
      ```

      - u/Zayits:
        ```
        > terribilic victory

        FTFY.
        ```

- u/Mountebank:
  ```
  Can someone find the exact wording to Cat's promise to Larat? Seven crowns and one: I'm guess the one has to be her own. Once the oath is fulfilled, the Wild Hunt will be subsumed into the Night? Is that why Larat is so terrified, that he'll lose his freedom once again and be locked into a role like he used to be with Winter?

  And it seems like my guess later chapter is right: Cat is going to break the pattern of three by losing to to the Pilgrim, in this case by surrendering, but not before achieving what she needs to achieve. I assume the Narrative will prevent someone as genre-savvy as Pilgrim from mistreating surrendered soldiers, especially for someone whose stated motivation is that he dislikes unnecessary suffering.

  I still believe that this is going to turn into a case where all three sides team up against an Arcadia/Hell fusion breach, and that's how Cat and Kairos are going to get leverage in negotiation.
  ```

  - u/Academic_Jellyfish:
    ```
    To stay in Creation, the Wild Hunt bound themselves to and drew power from Winter. Winter is now merged with Night, and Cat's the High Priestess, so now she has even more power over them than before. I think.
    ```

  - u/sparr:
    ```
    > “I will take the crown of seven mortals rulers and one, to lay them at the feet of the Prince of Nightfall,”

    This is her recounting the bargain to the princess of high noon, under a sort of bargain. I am unsure how bound she was to answer truthfully at that point.
    ```

- u/chaos-engine:
  ```
  Is Cat planning to abdicate the throne and this her armies before surrendering herself and "all armies under her command" to the Grey Pilgrim?

  Sounds like a wonderfully honest lie
  ```

- u/boomfarmer:
  ```
  Which letter was the knife, the bet, or the lie?
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:
    ```
    I'm 100% sure they're all designed so each can be each.  Some complicated "if the Pilgrim works with me then the letter to him is the bet and the note to Kairos is the lie, the reverse if Kairos works with me" or some such.
    ```

  - u/MyreMyalar:
    ```
    Hmm a surface run-through might conclude:

    * Bet on Vivienne/Army
    * Lie to Pilgrim about surrendering
    * Hidden Knife being Kairos. 

    &#x200B;

    Though if we assume she is genuinely trying to break Pilgrim's pattern of 3 trap maybe...

    * Knife for Pilgrim. What does he do with a surrendering army when they need all the troops they can get to fight the Dead King? Perhaps the coldly logical 'greatest good' thing is to 'force' conscript them to fight the Dead King. (i.e. what Cat wants anyway)
    * Lie to Kairos. She intends to deny him what he wants whatever it is on general principles that Kairos s a nutter.
    * Bet on Vivienne/Army. Cat is assuming that Pilgrim is going to separate her from her army and require her abdication as Queen of Callow (as he demanded before) as a condition of her surrender. Thus Vivienne will be in overall command of the Callowans. Perhaps once that is done Cat will ultimately vanish with the Drow.

    &#x200B;

    A lot of possibilities really.

  When did Hakram get his hand back?
  ```

  - u/cabforpitt:
    ```
    He has a skeleton hand made by Warlock.
    ```

    - u/aeschenkarnos:
      ```
      Didn't he chop the other one off to prove his trustworthiness to Vivienne?
      ```

      - u/Tenoke:
        ```
        He started off with 2 hands, lost one, gained one and then lost one again so now he's back to 1 (the 'deadhand')
        ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      He lost his other hand recently.
      ```
