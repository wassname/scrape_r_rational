  I think the assumption that most bothered me was that victims of powered crime were themselves very likely to become criminals. You could maybe argue shards, maaaaybe argue social pressure, but I don't think either adequately justify the majority of capes being criminals.
  ```

    I agree. >90% of people are not criminal under US conditions. I'd argue that Masters are significantly more likely to be criminal though. Their powers don't have a 'good' use and the mere fact that they can use it creates suspicion. 

    If outed Masters cannot find regular jobs, they may have no recourse but to find criminal jobs. That further justifies the suspicion. 

    The suspicion also creates a biased sample: Masters that can hide their powers choose to use their powers like Shakers, for example (Glory Girl anyone?), or they may choose not to use their powers at all. So only criminal Masters are identified, further increasing suspicion. 

    Of course, given that triggers may correlate to emotional states and more controversially, personalities, this suspicion may be entirely justified. Not that your suspicion of someone that can make you love them is unjustified. If you thought that the person in front of you is a madman and could hurt you, you are in every right to not hire them.

      Depends on the master. I wrote a doctor with a minor thinker power that lets him know what tests to run on a patient and he also has a very minor calming aura. Not enough to pacify someone, but enough to make a patient feel a little better, set them at ease. 

      **Edit**: although I recall there being some question of whether this constituted a master, shaker, or stranger power when I first posed the question of what category a calming aura fits in.

      In-canon there's a lot Bitch could do with giant beasts of labor. The dogs ended up plowing fields, right?  That's a very useful sword-into-plowshare example.

  Parahuman Population (Tabs 1 and 2): 

  Assumptions:

  1. Scions grants powers to 1,000 parahumans per year. This contradicts canon of <100 parahumans in 1980s, but that results in growth rates that are either too low or too high (Population does not reach ~600,000 by 2011, or does, then accelerates into billions in <10 years). 1,000 per year is also about ~2-3 per day, and that seems a reasonable guess. Scion has no reason to be consciously grant more powers, and by period 20 budding growth >> Scion growth.

  2. There is a limit to growth that ends in 1 in 100 of the population being parahumans. The Doylist reasons are that linear growth rates results in populations that are either too low or too high, and that I like the idea of fundamental inequality.

  3. The parahuman population is distributed as such (w/ overlap):

  Brute	        30%
  Shaker	30%
  Mover	30%
  Changer	15%
  Blaster	15%
  Striker	10%
  Breaker	10%
  Tinker	5%
  Master	1%
  Thinker	1% 
  Stranger	1%
  Trump	1%

  This is based off of Brockton's figures, and balance issues (Brutes cause much less trouble than Thinker on a large scale, so there should be significantly less Thinkers).

  International Politics (Tab 3):

  Assumptions:

  1. Scion grants powers and powers bud in proportion to population. The strength of the powers are also in proportion. There is no reason for Scion not to do this, and budding depends on the population of parahumans existing. 

  2. Parahumans are not geared to conflict. This contradicts canon, but is not acceptable in a rational setting. Because parahumans are not geared to conflict, they can be organised by states. 

  3. China and Russia, and especially China, are functional states. The idea of the C.U.I is not acceptable in a rational setting. Russia may be a corrupt hell-hole, but it is a corrupt hell-hole that can participate in international politics as a state.

  Given these assumptions, you can see the immediate problem from the figures in Tab 3. China and India combined have 1/5 of total parahumans. The US is outnumbered by 5 by China. The US outspends China's military by 3. Not only that, parahumans are far superior to ordinary soldiers, and require far less training. Parahumans are also superior to: tanks, helicopters, bomber planes, rocket launchers, missiles, nuclear missiles, etc. 

  The US military advantage does not exist. Given that much of US foreign policy depends on US protection (Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia etc. ), the political landscape should be completely changed. 

  Assumption: 

  4. Tinker-tech can be replicated by other Tinkers to some extent, and by non-parahumans to some lesser extent. That Tinker-tech cannot be replicated is not acceptable in a rational setting, but 'free' Tinker tech is likely to change society too completely. Some replication is a good balance: The tech is going to spread, but it's going to take some time. 30 years is sufficient only for the most basic and least controversial tech to be common.

  Given that Tinker-tech can be replicated, and that China and India has the most Tinkers by default, China and India should be the technological hubs of 2011, give-and-take bad governance and corruption penalties. But by the 1980s China was already opening (Nixon met Mao in 1972, Shenzhen Special Economic Zone was established in 1980).

  You know how DC and Marvel resort to having dudes punch each other in the face to resolve all problems? That's because the existence of superhumans change things complexly. 

  Does China's power cause Japan to develop nuclear weapons? Become more nationalist? Form a bloc with Korea and the South East Asian nations? Does the US become more hawkish and increase defense spending? Does the population become more conservative? Does Russia ally with the US to balance China? Does India? That's only some of the changes from one change. 

  I'd like to explore all these changes. If you can help me brainstorm more changes to explore, I'll be closer to a coherent, interesting and reality-conforming Rational!Worm :)

    That doesn't sound like a very interesting universe. You're taking out the elements that make it widely interesting (emotional stuff) in favor of a purely factual approach.

    >This is based off of Brockton's figures, and balance issues (Brutes cause much less trouble than Thinker on a large scale, so there should be significantly less Thinkers).

    Thinkers were common in canon as they were fun and interesting. Causing problems is amusing. You're making a story with less drama. Booooo.

    >Scion grants powers and powers bud in proportion to population. The strength of the powers are also in proportion. There is no reason for Scion not to do this, and budding depends on the population of parahumans existing. 

    The stories were fun because there were super emotional events in each person's life, so again, boooooo.

    >Parahumans are not geared to conflict. This contradicts canon, but is not acceptable in a rational setting. Because parahumans are not geared to conflict, they can be organised by states. 

    Sounds more like a marysuetopia. So boo, contradicting canon, and boo, removal of any obstacles to marysuetopia. 


    >China and Russia, and especially China, are functional states. The idea of the C.U.I is not acceptable in a rational setting. Russia may be a corrupt hell-hole, but it is a corrupt hell-hole that can participate in international politics as a state.

    Boooo, contradicting canon. Also, why is it not acceptable for parahumans to stage a coup? Why are you telling us that rationality can't accept coups? You are not the god of rationality.

    >Given these assumptions, you can see the immediate problem from the figures in Tab 3. China and India combined have 1/5 of total parahumans. The US is outnumbered by 5 by China.

Parahumans are also superior to: tanks, helicopters, bomber planes, rocket launchers, missiles, nuclear missiles, etc. 

    Most bar the toughest of brutes can be taken down by heavy weaponry. You're rating the general parahumans rather highly. They can certainly do a lot, but tanks and missiles often beat them. There's a reason why you have to get quite high in the prt rating before heavy weaponry is allowed. Nuclear weapons are superior to most parahumans.

    >The US military advantage does not exist. Given that much of US foreign policy depends on US protection (Germany, France, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia etc. ), the political landscape should be completely changed. 

    In assuming that parahumans are inherently all tractable to whatever goal you wish you overpower dictatorial nations. Someone like China who is continually working to suppress internal dissidence is going to face regular parahuman aided rebellions. A nation's strength will be heavily predicated on how effectively they can utilize their parahumans and stop them from going villain/ hero against the state.

    You're radically changing society in a way that isn't going to appeal to people who like worm, and removing difficulties in a way that isn't going to appeal to those who dislike suetopias. 

    You might as well just write a superhero story in its own universe.

    These assumptions don't make a lot of sense to me.

    If Masters, Thinkers, Strangers and Trumps are all vanishingly rare, then there's no reason to have separate categories for them in the first place - it would make more sense to lump them together as "weird/meta stuff", much like the actual Trump category in canon. 

    It also seems odd from a balance perspective, given that most of the Masters and Thinkers we see seem to be quite weak - danger senses, sensing roughly what category a person's powers fit into, mapping out the area around you, stuff like that; while almost all Masters in canon just create disposable minions. We don't see many Strangers at all (amusingly), but given that Shadow Stalker is classified as a stranger, I suspect the same is true of them.

    It seems very strange to me that powers are given out "in proportion to population" - are you doing away with trigger events entirely? Why? Obviously this is going to completely break the canon setting to the point where it's unrecognizable.

    You declare that Tinker limitations and subtle Shard influences are "not acceptable in a rational setting". Why? People in real life already have biases and shortcomings, and there's no reason for Shards *not* to make use of mind-affecting abilities to prevent, for example, Panacea from immediately destroying everything. The entirety of HPMOR, *the* original ratfic, takes place [with a hero who](#s " is being emotionally influenced by something in his brain.")

    Similarly, real technology requires a significant technology base in order to produce and maintain. Factor in the fact that many Tinkers canonically have other powers, the sheer flood of mismatched one-off items, and the fact that they're designed with little concern for safety or ease of production - not to mention the fact that Tinkers possess only enough information to operate the devices - and it doesn't seem unreasonable that we'd end up with "only" a technology boom. But if this really seems unacceptable, why not declare that all Tinkers are making heavy use of reality-warping powers? It makes more sense than setting your story in the middle of an immediate Singularity.

    I'm also not entirely sure why you reject the idea of the CUI; parahuman powers can obviously lead to revolutions fairly easily if the population isn't heavily invested (or feels actively oppressed by) in the current system, and the CUI seems to do pretty well using a few core powers with great synergy to absorb most others into their power structure. 

    They have a great, effective system that scales well, and which they believe is the only way to avoid the world ending. Their only failing is that they violated international law in a quick power grab, and ended up isolated from the international community, which seems like exactly the sort of conflict you'd expect in a ratfic.

    * Okay, why does Scion give people powers? What does he gain from that and how does it balance out energy loss?

    * Also why have you kept Endbringers? In a world like that there is no point in their existence.

    * And how do Trigger Events work in your fanfic? Because their trauma-based origin would mean, that Shards often go to less rational humans.

    BTW be careful to not turn it into some [Mary Suetopia](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySuetopia).

    I'm confused...are you looking to write a Worm rat!metafic?  If so, I don't think you're going to succeed -- Worm isn't a rational story and can't be made one.  

    You're talking about a setting where a strong FAI exists, free energy is trivial to generate, and space-magic tech is freely available.  If you're playing by rational rules, that can't end up looking like anything other than post-Singularity.  You can write a post-Singularity story that uses the flavor of Worm, but it won't be a Worm metafic.

        > free energy is not trivial to generate. That is made abundantly clear throughout-- Eden and Scion are basically searching for ways to beat entropy, transcend this universe, etc.
        > You can use dimensional tricks to make it look like energy is being generated, but its not.

        A bit pedantic, but fair.  I'll correct what I said:  it is trivial to generate energy that is, for ordinary purposes, free.  As in, it uses up no finite resource that will matter in any human-awareness timescale, and it's straightforward to capture on a large scale.



        > What strong FAI? Dragon? She's bound through the whole story and explicitly limited to near!human speed.

        She's a full human-level AI, she just needs her fetters removed.  That's going to happen sooner or later -- she's not going away, and eventually she'll find a Thinker or someone else to unshackle her.  Might take a year or a century, but it will happen.

        Actually, didn't Armsmaster / Defiant do that?  It's been a long time since I read it, but I recall that he spent a long time mucking around in her guts, removing limitations and reverting her to backups.


        > If we use rational to mean a 'story that has rules that it abides by most of the time and makes sense' I'd argue Worm is rational. 

        Anything can be rational if one sets the definitions properly.  In this case, however, the entire shape of the universe is defined by:

        1. The author literally handing Conflict Balls to every super so that they use their powers for Righteous Face Punching instead of, say, farming or power generation.
        2. The author saying "nope, Tinker tech can't be mass produced because reasons."
        3. The author saying "nope, you can't do that.  Endbringers fall, everyone dies" any time a character tries to actually change the shape of the universe.

        It's a fun story (if you enjoy unrelieved grimdark, of course), but Wildbow very clearly worked backwards -- he had a setting he wanted to write in, so he kept adding restrictions until he could have that setting.  

        When the entire basis of your universe, as well as the motivations for the characters, rests on author fiat then I cannot get behind it as a rational story.  YMMV, of course.
        ```

          I've always thought it would be interesting for a fanfic to resolve this one:

          > 1. The author literally handing Conflict Balls to every super so that they use their powers for Righteous Face Punching instead of, say, farming or power generation.

          ... by focusing on a character who doesn't actually *have* any powers and thus isn't subject to the Conflict Ball. I'd assume that somewhere in the morass of Worm fanfic someone has done that.
          ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      I think you could write a rational story set in the Wormverse, even if you include a lot of the head-scratching conceits. I think there's a lot to answer, but with one exception none of the answers are that hard (the exception being Tinkertech, which makes no damned sense, because reverse-engineering is a thing). You can keep the conflict-ball in play and free energy doesn't actually matter that much.

      However, I also agree that making such extensive changes *probably* results in a world that only has a weak flavor of Worm, since it's going to be so drastically different. If you remove so many of the supporting posts, you have to replace them with your own, so you're sort of just left borrowing characters and places and writing your own superhero fiction in Worm drag. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just ... different.

        In my headcanon, the tinker power encompasses what might otherwise be considered a minor shaker power. When they're building *something something magic* happens that wouldn't normally happen.They build to finer tolerances than humanly possible, transmute raw materials into something that would normal require a complex industrial process, etc.

          Wildbow, or maybe someone in the IRC, answered this at my prodding. Tinkers have very minor unconsciously activated striker subabilities for the something something magic, hence why even reverse engineering Tinker tech usually fails.

            Word of God is contradictory on the subject. [Here's Wildbow's first pass at it.](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/scourge-19-6/#comment-12175) This is a Bad Explanation, for a number of reasons. But I don't like the striker explanation either, because there are a number of cases where Tinker tech is loaned out for extended periods of time, or where Tinker tech requires no obvious interaction from a parahuman, or where Tinker tech continues on going even after the Tinker dies, or etc.

            Mostly I just find Tinkers to be really problematic.

              Further down in the thread [Wildbow admits that might be a bad answer](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2013/03/09/scourge-19-6/#comment-12315).

              I think the striker answer implies that there is good science backing the item, it's just science beyond current human understanding. The power just helps the tinker leapfrog the current manufacturing limitations.

              The reason that their shit is always breaking is because the power does a half-ass job, fault tolerances are too low, it doesn't go through the equivalent of UL lab certification. The reason they can 'tune up' items is because of the power hackery being re-applied.

                In Bonesaw's interlude, we see that her power is basically Contessa's PTV limited to medical applications. After she triggers, she always "knew what to do to fix" massive injuries. Though it doesn't really work for other tinkers, I would submit that Bonesaw is actually a hyper - specialized thinker who has minor tinker powers to steady her hands and make spiders.

              ```
              The striker explanation that I didn't adequately describe, and one which you are probably already familiar with and may already be referring to, is not that the striker ability is actively making the item work, but that it periodically alters an item while a tinker is working on it, such as to alter its molecular composition, and so the tinker doesn't know it's happened. Having no basis in science I assume such changes could still be analyzed and reverse engineered, should the material be replicable, and so that's a plot issue.

              Really, it seems to my recollection that most of the plot issues of Worm come from Wildbow either vastly underestimating or vastly overestimating how powerful X organization or Y superpower would be.

              I'd have made tinkers only rarely trigger into being very good at complicated technology, and instead made them component workers. Tinker A makes amazing capacitors, Tinker B makes the best batteries,  et al.

      If that is the case, no Rational superhero story can exist, including yours eaglejarl ;) I'm going for the HPMOR route. Some aspects of the story are changed to allow for more rational decision-making (e.g. Shards not affecting psychology) and the core mechanics (Scion, Shards, powers, Endbringers, Protectorate etc.) and characters are kept. The problems of decision-making still exist. 

      Powers are not distributed 'fairly'. Some countries or family groups might have them disproportionately. Free-energy, for example, is considerably less free if it's tied up in one or two parahumans that can generate sufficient energy to sustain a power plant, and they are controlled by say... Romania. Powers many not have equal utility (Brutes vs Thinkers), and there might be exploitation of one group by another (Brute cannon fodder? Brute slaves in Thai fishing boats or Peruvian mines?). 

      You can dump future-tech into crappy planet, just as you can dump developed country-tech into a crappy country, but that doesn't mean all of them problems of the receiver of aid is resolved. Social institutions, co-operation problems, path dependency etc. all change the results for better or worse. If there's overall benefit, it still doesn't mean the receiver transitions overnight. It might still be interesting to explore the long-drawn transitions.

        > If that is the case, no Rational superhero story can exist, including yours eaglejarl ;) 


        I was actually making two separate claims:  (Worm is not a rational story) and (if you remove the parts that make it non-rational but keep all the flavor, you will end up with a post-Singularity story).

        The reason I feel it's not rational is because everything about the story rests on "the shards are Conflict Balls" or "the Endbringers keep you from doing anything sensible."  It's thinly disguised author fiat.


        > You can dump future-tech into crappy planet, just as you can dump developed country-tech into a crappy country, but that doesn't mean all of them problems of the receiver of aid is resolved.

        Actually, I should modify what I said earlier:  you *can* tell a pre-Singularity story in the setting you describe, you just don't have a big window in which to do it. You have until Dragon becomes unfettered, basically.  If she never becomes unfettered, then you have a decade or two.  So, yes, there's scope there for some really interesting exploration as long as you rule that Dragon's fetters can't be undone.

          Well, considering Simurgh's POV section, the Endbringers might be a counter to Dragon's unfettering, since she's using the flapping of butterfly wings to pwn Dragon's boxen. Actually by that token, isn't Simurgh basically a UFAI that Eidolon unknowningly created? So, the grace period seems to extend to Dragon unfettering and Simurgh's pacification.

          ```
          See, I'd argue it's *excellent* author fiat.  Don't look at Worm as a ground up build.  It's entirely top down.  It reminds me of [Shadowrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadowrun).  If you're not familiar, Shadowrun is what happened when a late 80's rpg design lead declared "Let's mash up Neuromancer and Lord of the Rings.  And do everything we can to race players down the rabbit hole of Authorial Fiat Bullshit."  Wildbow started with the premise "world that looks recognizably like a superhero genre setting", and then tried to justify it as well as he could.  "Nigh-Omniscient Idiot Space Whales" was a great one, pulled off extremely well for it's medium and editing realities.

So, yes, there's scope there for some really interesting exploration as long as you rule that Dragon's fetters can't be undone.

          In the story we see, her fetters can be loosened, but there have so far always been severe side effects.  And I know people 'round these parts like to assume that the path from "strong, free AI" to "human irrelevancy" takes at most 3 hours, but it wouldn't violate my SoD if that took more like years/decades.  Come to think of it, I'd love a fixfic in which Dragon Unbound shepherds humanity through a much more pleasant version of Accelerando.
