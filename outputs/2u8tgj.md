## Rational Terrain of Magical Expertise?

### Post:

I'm considering attempting to write a rational novel version of Christopher Niosi's TOME webseries:

*Meet Nylocke, a smart young british gamer whose overly emotional nature often gets the better of him. He loves to play in the hit virtual reality gaming and social networking phenomenon, TOME: Terrain of Magical Expertise. Then his character got infected by a semi-intelligent computer virus with unknown motives that can cause harm to other players in real life, which a group of hackers desparately want to get their hands on. To stop the hackers and the virus, Nylocke will need wits, courage, and the help of his friends: Alpha, a shy uber-fanboy with an equally uber inferiority complex and a great memory; Infernalexis, a defensive, slightly judgemental, quick to anger but ultimately good-natured computer-programmer who thinks fast on her feet and is fiercely protective of her friends; Kirbopher, a snarky, sarcastic, witty, cool, slightly badass, hardcore gamer who's unafraid to give the middle finger to all the stop-having-fun-guys, especially hackers; and Gamecrazed, a mysterious, serious, reserved, and intelligent player with inscrutable motives.*

some of the ideas I've come up with so far: 

the semi-sentient computer virus is known as “the forbidden power” because it doesn't really have its own intelligence. Rather, it borrows the host's intelligence to achieve its goals.

Also, something that really popped out to me:

TOME character models are to the forbidden power
as Pokemon are to Missingno

I was thinking about how TOME players would need to have some way of using their virtual bodies (character models), and still be able to live as normal humans outside of the game. If the person's mind is somehow temporarily converted to fit their character models when they're playing, or something, and the forbidden power is a copy of the template for all character models programmed into the game (but without having been converted into an actual character model yet), then that might have something to do with how the forbidden power could have access to its host's mind/intelligence in the first place, since the game would need to access the player's mind to temporarily convert their human mind into its scifi/fantasy race equivalent. But that seems really complicated, and it feels like it would be a lot simpler to just have the character models be like costumes over a human-shaped frame without some crazy complicated maybe impossible "make a human brain temporarily able to feel and control x virtual body part as if it was their own" But if I go the non-invasive route, then how the heck would the Forbidden power work?

Any ideas?
