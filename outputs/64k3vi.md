## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  A little while back I asked people for their thoughts on reforming education in the Off-Topic thread.

  I finally finished the post on competition, reform, and metrics in education! It's on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@owenshen/the-ancient-god-who-rules-high-school-e0645b100ae6).

  (I've linked to it on LW and a few other places, so if you're wondering it's the one about Moloch and competition.)

    Regarding solution 1: Yes, realistic views are always helpful, but people need to have some reason to believe that they are or are not in the top 1%. Keep the Dunning-Kruger effect in mind. There's a risk that more competent individuals will compete less because they more fully understand the scope of what they don't know, and thus believe they are not as competent. Realistic views may not be very helpful and could even be harmful if students are not given enough comparative data to see where they stand, and that's tricky if you don't have a good metric to allow students to see their standing.

    Solution 2: Good point, and I think changing social norms/customs is easier than you realize.

    Solution 3: I'm actually very much in favor of standardization in education. I think it should be feasible, for example, to create educational videos with amazing lecturers and visual explanations and then try slight variations between the versions which are given to different classrooms and schools. Subsequent test scores could be used to determine if there was a statistically significant benefit in any of the versions. The same could be done with textbooks, homework assignments, and educational games.

    With this standardized evidence-based incrementally-improving approach, you could find the teaching methods and audiovisual learning aids which work best for most people. You could also use regression analysis to work out which approaches work best with which demographics and tailor the content to the demographics represented by the school.

    I do think good teachers are crucial, but I think their role should be aimed more towards augmenting standardized teaching materials with the ability to answer students' questions and fill in any unexpected gaps in prerequisite knowledge.

    Solution 4: Good point regarding having teachers both grade students and teach them. I can see how there's potential for that to cause challenging interpersonal relationships which inhibit learning. It's certainly worth a try to see if splitting up the roles of grading and teaching might improve outcomes.

    The only other thing I would add is that I think our testing methodology obviously needs to change substantially to distinguish genuine knowledge and intelligence from good test-preparation. Without more accurate tests, it's challenging to get useful data. Unfortunately, I'm not sure of any good way to do that in a cost-effective way. Any thoughts?

      Standardization in education works as soon as we can standardize humans. What makes us individuals also makes "one size fits all" solutions suboptimal (for the individual) in many cases.

      The ultimate school would have teachers that get to know each pupil and figure out how to stimulate them to perform optimally. The manpower, training and experience needed to achieve that is economically unfeasible until we replace teachers with AIs. 

      Perhaps a middle road is to give teachers a "toolbag" of standardized teaching and diagnostics methods, and train them to figure out which tools work best for each student.

    ...Maybe we should do away with the whole conception of a particular place where most of our education takes place, where what we learn is neither determined by necessity nor by interest/curiosity, but instead by authorities who are more interested in making their school look good than in actually teaching well.

    Instead of school, maybe we should just make learning a bigger part of everyday life. School teaches kids to think of learning and thinking as boring and difficult. People don't usually go to class because they want to, but rather because they have to. Get rid of school and a lot of kids will probably stop learning to hate learning. Instead of having majors and degrees, just let people learn whatever they want or need to know, and let them keep track of their educational progress by actually demonstrating that they have the knowledge or skills  in actual situations like internships or volunteer work or games or whatever. When applying for a job, they could just send their resume without worrying about educational certification because their qualifications will be automatically implied by the stuff on their resume.

      I agree with you in principle, but I completely disagree that a system like that would have the benefits you're after in practice.  

      > where what we learn is neither determined by necessity nor by interest/curiosity  

      I can't see this as a bad thing. It's like saying that you should throw out the practice drills where you run between cones, because running between cones isn't a fundamental part of soccer. The point of learning subjects you're not necessarily interested in is to either train certain mental skills, or to make sure that you do have some basic facts that you might not end up learning anywhere else. If you don't have either school or an educated family that teaches you, how are you going to get far enough in a subject (take math for example) to start seeing the practical uses for it? How are you going to know which subjects are useful to you before studying them? I had no idea that economics would be useful to me until I learned it. Having a curriculum that includes "boring things" helps you avoid the unknown unknowns.  

      > Get rid of school and a lot of kids will probably stop learning to hate learning.  

      The unfortunate reality is, when left to their own devices most people will just stop learning entirely. From my experience, people think "common sense" is enough to get by on. Why let people get by with the bare minimum of whatever sparks their curiousity? What you've created then is a population that's even _more_ susceptible to harmful pseudo-scientific nonsense.

        I think this is somewhat true, but if you really want to learn something, you should always try doing the thing that is closest to the thing you want to learn.

        EX: If you want to play good Ultimate Frisbee, play a lot of Ultimate Frisbee. *Then*, if you realize that you need additional distance, practice throwing frisbees for distance. But don't immediately start throwing frisbees for the goal of getting better at playing Ultimate.

      I'm all in favor of expanding people's ability to self-teach, but there are limits if you don't have fairly educated people around you to answer questions. There are also safety concerns when it comes to exclusively teaching yourself in order to pick up the skills to do certain jobs. For example, imagine yourself growing up in a household with two parents who never went to college and trying to teach yourself everything you'd need to know to work as a cardiothoracic surgeon, or an aerospace engineer. Considering the prior probability of how unlikely it is that you could succeed at this, there's almost no test we could give you that would give us a high degree of confidence that you've learned enough to avoid killing people in either of those professions.

      Even something comparatively simple like learning to become an electrician, or to speak a foreign language can be immensely challenging if you do not have someone to teach you. In general, you can probably learn about 90% of what you might need to know from books and videos alone, but there's still going to be a significant number of gaps where a knowledgeable teacher can spot your mistakes and answer your questions.

      With better self-teaching materials, many of these problems may eventually be resolved, but it seems like schools are a necessary evil for now.

    I can't figure out how to make a medium account on mobile, so I'll put my plan here(I graduated from a private Jewish high school last year,if that helps with my frame of reference) : Two parts: Shrink and specialize. 
    Part 1) Shrink: one of the classic ways to avoid the prisoner's dilemma is to make sure everyone knows what everyone else will do, which allows effective precommitment. Shrinking school and class sizes(as well as taking tests from a curve to a raw system) should change the incentives of students into a PvE rather than PvP contest at least in part. 
    2: Specialize: Schools, starting from high school onwards, should be more vocational. This solves a lot of the goodhart problem, since much of the reason for the existence of standardized metrics is to let unqualified evaluators evaluate. Compare SATs to APs and, further on, APs to Olympiads for an example.

  So! I've "finished" my supernatural romance story. (Note: Finished means that there's no new scenes to write, TONs of editing still needs to be done - I'll give it 2 months or so before it's finished for real). Needless to say I'm feeling pretty awesome right now.

  I'd like to thank this subreddit and especially /u/ccc_037 for encouraging me to write it and for providing me with so much help and support along the way (even if the support was the ability to shout in the void by posting a comment that never got a reply, it was still very helpful!). 

  It's at ~50,000 words, 13 chapters over about 110 pages. 

  Here's my beeminder page for it, which was probably also instrumental in ensuring I stayed on the wagon so to speak: www.beeminder.com/mad/redandwilliam

  I would recommend beeminder to anyone who has goals and wants to make sure they stick to them.

  I desperately need new reading material in my life. Looking for suggestions. Non-standard preferably, since I've probably read most of the standard by now.

    Which direction? Fiction, nonfiction, sci-fi/fantasy/romance/crime/ etc.  My weird/awesome-recommendation is "the integral trees" by Niven. Weak as fiction goes, but one step above everything regarding the worldbuilding.

    [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com) is my usual word-brick whenever someone asks me for something new to read. If not that, maybe one of the many unique and quite lengthy works by [Stefan Gagne](http://stefangagne.com) is to your taste.
    ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    SF: *Dolphin Island* and *The Deep Range* by Arthur C Clarke - both classics.  Anything by Greg Egan or Vernor Vinge.  *Perilous Waif* by E Brown is popcorn SF with unusually good (and recent!  ewar, nanotech, AI...) worldbuilding.

    Fantasy: Diane Duane's *Young Wizards* series will make you want to be a better person.  Brandon Sanderson is unbelievably prolific and very good with magic systems; plus some free online stuff which is great.

    Ursula K LeGuin is probably underappreciated - try *The Dispossessed*, then *A Wizard of EarthSea* and then *The Left Hand of Darkness* if you liked it.

    Any more than that and I'd need a (general) description of the genres and authors you read or like.
    ```

    I'd say give Mark Z. Danielewski a try. His most popular book, by far, is House of Leaves. There's a lot happening in that book, but my best summary of it is that it is a very nontraditional take on a haunted house story.

    Danielewski plays with how to arrange text on the page in ways that most authors would never approach, and he is always finding ways to incorporate this into the themes of the book as well as the moods of the scenes. Some find it pretentious and overwrought, but I thought it was an excellent book.

    If you have read House of Leaves, give volume 1 of his latest project a shot. It's called the Familiar, and while I'll be honest and say that plot is not a priority in this book in any way, he captures mood like no other. 

    Even if it's the kind of thing where you read a few chapters of it and end up hating it and never reading it again, Danielewski is someone who should be experienced at least once. 

    And just to be clear, it has to be in print. Even if he did make his own work available on eReader formats, a LOT would be lost in the translation.
