    Nah, the royalty would deny that ~~climate change~~ Koscheiâ€™s changes are real and ignore the issue.

      Take him prisoner, evacuate everyone, shoot him *and* the royalty.

      That was basically my point. It's very hard to convince a lot of people to bear immediate & asymmetrical costs (evacuating & permanently submerging farmland, etc.) in order to mitigate a fuzzily perceived threat a century or two down the line. This is a  medieval society that hasn't experience exponential growth long enough to understand it.

  Hmm, though, wouldn't every extra birth lead to an extra death? And thus, even if starvation doesn't come, his power should rise as people die of old age?

    Jupp. Also all the accidents, normal warfare, other illnesses etc. etc. If feedback loop from the Deathspring is good enough to work on "slaugthered villages" and can consume kingdoms, Koschei should by now have some measure of power again.

      I admit this... cough... cough.. weak plot... cough

        I imagine that simply keeping the Deathspring in effect incurs a running cost, and with present death rates the feedback is just barely enough to sustain it.
        ```

          That's a neat idea, which I didn't think of !
          Might be a reasonable patch for that particular plot hole.

        2ndly, he does not have to hope for starvation. He should boost population as much as he can, and keep the carrying capacity high.

        He'll be hailed as the Saviour as he basically saves billions (so that they can birth more billions), while still getting godless amount of mana when they end up dying of old age anyway.

        Tho, that can be explained by him being a little villainy & didn't think of it.
        ```

  - u/VanPeer:
    ```
    Yes, negative feedback will also increase as population size increases. The story assumptions are over-simplistic and rather shaky to keep exposition simple. I'll have to model it & see.

  Interesting. Depending on how the spell interprets "killed" (Given that it allows for indirect means) you could:

  - Make a spell that kills the germs in water, then replaces them with 5-50% clones of the dead germs, cleaning it while still giving you deaths by pestilence.

  - Figure out how to cure various plagues, then withhold the cure

  - Encourage the widespread practice of euthanasia in order to prevent suffering the last moments of the person's life, thus claiming their death
  ```

  Why'd Koschei go in that room? It doesn't look like Vern could do anything if left alone with the runes.

  Doubling in twenty years means five-folding in a century? 

  Why would he channel all his power into the spell if he's going to Elder God status either way?

  How does Koschei know there will be no more research breakthroughs? A thousandfold amount of wizards surely should be able to invent spells to combat starvation in any number of ways Koschei didn't imagine.
  ```

    Good catch. I realized after I had published it that I meant to say "thirty fold" (2^5 = 32). I will fix the typo. The results are correct, I think. (2^5 x 60e6 ~ 1900e6)   (2^10 x 60e6 ~ 60e9)

    Elder God status is due to return on investment from the spell that requires drain of all of the Dark Wizard's reserve, which he gets back many fold by subsequent bloodiness. Wizard's in this world are long-lived but not immortal by default. Sorry if that wasn't clear.

    It's entirely possible (even likely) that technological breakthroughs will foil Koschei's plans. 

    Why did Koschei return to his secret lair? It's supposed to be in the middle of a forest, with no nearby settlements. He had stepped out to take a leak, when Vern crashed in. Perhaps Koschei didn't fancy fleeing without provisions...

  I love it when people remember slavic folk heroes and/or villains)

  That said, I highly doubt that "social forces" Koschei set in motion will keep fertility high. They are so unpredictable it's quite impossible to plan even for a decade forvard, forget about a sentury.

  And yes, there is quite a few ways to deal with a wizard who has no power and whose only save is a bomb on a deadman switch. You can evacuate everyone in the blast radius, you can try to build a barrier around the blast and try to tank it. Or you can do a dangerous, evil and pragmatic move: imprison him, sedate and put on a mana drain, fueling some kind of great spell (welcome to immortality, bitch). Leaving him alone. on the other hand, is out of question: even if fertility rates will stabilize, he would still wield unmatching power and immortality, and the chance that one day he'll just go crazy and decide to wipe out humanity is just too big.
