## A character trope that needs more exploring

  It's on the tip of my tongue, oh yes, one of the character's in Pratchett's _The Dark Side of the Sun_, a robot who doesn't WANT free will because he doesn't want the responsibility.

  Also, one of Pratchett's best, back before he stumbled into the Discworld.

    Reminds me of the NSFW take on that in *The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures*.

    > “So this is just...how you work. This is what makes you happy.”
    > 
    > “Yeah. And I...I can’t have any questions. This gets rid of the questions for good.”
    > 
    > “Questions?”
    > 
    > “I can’t wonder if you want me near or not, I can’t wonder if you like how we’re fucking, I can’t wonder if you’re happy. I can’t wonder if I please you. I can’t wonder if I’m overwhelming or not enough. I need to just know. If I’m chained up and following orders, I know. If I have to sit at your feet for watches and watches wishing you’d fuck me I know I’m not too much, and if I can’t turn your touch away I know I’m not too little. This makes it safe enough. To love as hard as I love.”

  Seems pretty much like dogs.  Sure we weren't domesticating them on purpose, and they're not smart enough to philosophize, but they're definitely happy.
  ```

    ```
    Dogs domesticated us as well, made us happy to be with them.

      It's really weird looking through the mutualism of Humans and Dogs, we're really really far apart on the evolutionary tree, but we're both closer to one another than any other species. 

      Great Apes included, they're relatable but I fear the chimp as a default, trust the dog as a default.
      ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:

        Convergent evolution. Humans and dogs both fit into the same niche, so they could travel and hunt together and keep up with each other. Cats had to wait until humans created a niche they could fit into.

        If we hadn’t domesticated dogs would we have domesticated cats or horses? 

        There’s a sorta-webfic out there about how human’s relationship with other species is seen as really weird by other galactic civilizations. I might have caught it on HFY or something.

        Assuming that you understand both chimps and dogs...

        Fearing chimps is definitely appropriate because we recognize that chimps are a lot like us mentally.  They are frequently unpredictable because they are both intelligent and occasionally irrational, no matter how much time you spend training them.

        Dogs, on the other hand are nothing like us mentally.  Unless they are in pain, diseased, or have a history of being abused, a trained dog is absurdly rational, a lot less smart than us, and predictable.

    See ? That's the exploration I mean :) I love that sort of existential horror and the various predictable ways characters would attempt to cope.

      One could argue that reality hasn't been explored on a fundamental level yet because humanity doesn't have instruments that can see things that small.

    Evolution is a bitch.

    Hmm, even for entertainment you can still have an actual attachment. 

    I've still got the same horrible IV Swampert from 2003 transferred up through every pokemon game. He's not even got a personality, and he is associated with nostalgia more than anything else but if I ever lose that guy I'm going to legit cry. 

    We can design meaning, give meaning, and create meaning in the most trivial things. At some point, a character in a story is real. The only difference is they live in a world of flipping switches, words on a page, tales told around campfires, or in the mind. 

    You can feel their pain, their loss, and those fictional characters like Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones, Darth Vader, are going to be remembered for far longer than you or I. 

    So which one is more real?

  Wow my bird villager mostly just talks about how crusty his clothes are, I feel ripped off

  - u/Askolei:
    ```
    Oh it's from Animal Crossing then? At first I thought it was Jessie talking to her Meowth.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Ya given the spirals I'd guess it's an AC character talking to [Midge](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Midge).

      But the character in the comic doesn't have any ears...

  "Wow, well I'm only really nice to people because I need good character references to give to my parole officer. But if I'm just a simulation I guess it doesn't matter, does it *bitch*?

  This picture got cut off on my phone, so all I could see were the three middle panels. "It would mean someone out there put a lot of work into making me just so I could love you."

  I was trying to figure out why someone put a Christian picture on r/rational to explore character tropes, and why nobody else was catching on to the fact it's clearly talking about God/humanity. :P

  <reflection on power>   

  Power is the ability to impose  one's will on reality; to be dissatisfied with reality is to want  reality to be different, which is to want the power to make reality be  different.

  If a being with great  power made you as a tool for that being's will, and you are either wholly satisfied with things as they are or dissatisfied with the same things that that being is dissatisfied with, then perhaps there's no conflict:  you can imagine an example of someone making a copy of themselves, but with certain missing abilities and memories.  Divergence is still a potential issue, perhaps avoidable through regular synchronisation.  

  Once you desire power to change things that your more-powerful creator does not will to be changed, there is a conflict.  


  Mental image that comes to mind:  "I HAVE MADE YOU AS THE PERFECT EMOTIONALLY-SENSITIVE LOVE LETTER.  GO, AND MAKE THIS PARTICULAR PERSON HAPPY."  "Oh my stars there are *so many starving children in the world*.  I must cross the ocean on a mecha carrying great big bags of food **now** or as soon as logistically possible *no matter who would stop me.*"  


  I reflect on the feeling of horror when reading a description of the ideal Ubermensch as repeating the same time-cycle over and over again while making no changes and being entirely content with the situation.  The term 'stagnant' and cached phrase 'apathy is death' come to mind.

  Was scrolling through r/Rational's top posts for good stuff I missed over the years. For future delvers, the linked OP deleted their post but it looks like the material can still be found on their tumblr here: https://animauxing.tumblr.com/post/616339604752187392/soundless-love-song
