## I'm writing a story and the protagonist is allergic to water and cannot drink a sip of water without going into shock. Is this realistic?

  Is this a shitpost?  Even if there was a community that'd be interested in this idea, and maybe there is, r/rational is  not it.  This is the least rational and logically consistent idea I've heard in a while.  The human body is composed of up to 60% water, so good luck surviving if your body is actively trying to tear itself apart.  Even if there was some milk based diet (ignoring that milk is also mostly water) that they could live on, how did they survive through infancy?   Did their parents know instinctively that they were fatally hydrophobic?  The only way I could see this being rational is if this character is from a universe with completely different physics and chemistry, maybe a magical hell analog.  While we don't know for sure that water is necessary for life, it's pretty hard to avoid.  We used to think that earth is the only planet in the solar system with water, or at least liquid water, but we now know that water, or water ice at least, is pretty much everywhere.  Point is, this is not a story that's easy to write rationally, not unless you're okay with spending tons of time on worldbuilding.

  I was going to suggest you post this in a biology subreddit, checked your post history to see if you had and... wow, you are determined to get this question answered.

  As people have pointed out to you, it's possible for her to be allergic to minerals commonly found in water but not the H2O molecule itself. You don't seem satisfied with this.

  The case of Heidi Falconer is interesting, but doesn't fit the parameters of your story:

  > This condition is called aquagenic pruritus, and it is a very rare skin condition characterized by severe intense itching when the skin is exposed to water for more than a very short period of time. **Water consumed internally is not an issue.** A presumably related disorder is aquagenic urticaria where skin contact with water produces raised welts or hives. In both cases, individual reactions can vary from the mild to the severe. Ms. Falconer appears to fall into the latter category.

  > Neither of these disorders is believed to be a true allergy (not that that provides sufferers with any ease) as there is no evidence of the histamine reaction that characterizes allergies, but in neither case is the mechanism well-understood. 

  [From quora](https://www.quora.com/How-is-Heidi-Falconer-not-dead-since-she-claims-shes-so-allergic-to-water-that-a-drop-of-water-in-her-mouth-could-kill-her-yet-her-saliva-is-99-5-H2O) (Emphasis mine)

  Honestly, the fact that this allergy is an interesting concept that *sounds* somewhat plausible and is only one step removed from a real condition is enough to justify it in a story. I wouldn't worry so much about justifying it as 100% true to medical science.

  It's an interesting idea, now just go and write it.

    This is the fourth account I've banned for spamming this question to the subreddit. Two of the others have been suspended, likely for ban evasion. I've reported this one to the admins too.

  Only in Discworld, where they have dehydrated water.

  This is like homeopathy, like her body detects some magic supernatural memory in the water. Don't do it.

  _Edit: unless you're Terry Pratchett, but you're not because he died recently and you probably didn't._

  She could have a reaction to water if it's too pure because of some kind of osmotic problem with the mucus membranes of her throat or something, but saline of the right strength would be a pretty solid solution to that.

  You are one of several alt accounts, including: /u/Busy_Barnacle
   , /u/Jimmy-ligger
   , /u/Shruborb
   , and /u/PM_ME_NERDTHIGHS
   , all of which were created in mid- to late-September after all of your other alts were banned. Those alts included: /u/ButtButtaFace
   , /u/LegaladviceSam
   , /u/Confessthrowaway3444
   , /u/Due_Personality
   , /u/tooafraidthrowa
   , /u/StandardStudy
   , and /u/yourbrainonmuffinz
   .

  Why were they banned? Because you keep spamming reddit with nonsense about a supposed "water allergy".

  I'd say this is not realistic on a couple of different levels. How/why is she allergic? Tap water, pure water, saline all cause a potentially fatal reaction? There's humidity in the air. If she's that sensitive to water how can she breathe? Has she managed to avoid ever getting rained on or getting hit with a sprinkler or mister? Has she never taken a bath or a shower?  


  I guess if you're saying it's some kind of immune system thing, that would allow for incidental contact with water. I'm not sure "antibodies against water" actually makes any sense, but if it did then why can't she swallow water? Something going through your digestive system isn't going to immediately cause an antibody reaction. Blood is largely composed of water, so why is she immune to blood?  


  From a story standpoint, if "a sip of water can instantly kill her" then how did she survive a saline drip?

  Milk is 90% water.

  Apples are 90% water.

  Steak is 30% water.

  You can't be allergic to H2O and survive. An alien can't be deathly allergic to H2O and survive on earth, especially eating earth food and earth drinks.

  You literally posted this a few months ago. So maybe don't?
