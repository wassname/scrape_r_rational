  I think there's another key reason for why "brains" solutions are preferred over "brawns" in the written medium: they come off better. If you watch a superhero movie or an anime, physical combat can be made to be nothing short of spectacular. It's aesthetically pleasing and narratively dense, as many details of a well-choreographed quick exchange of blows can communicate a lot to us about what the combatants are like and what's going on in general. On the other hand, in written word, physical combat translates poorly. You got a lot of telling and little showing, long technical descriptions or vague hints at prodigious feats of strength. Puzzles and riddles on the other hand are very well-suited to the written word. Reading about the pieces laid down and then a clever solution feels much more like I've actually *seen* what is so great about the hero rather than just reading "and then he punched the enemy to death, the end".

      Hah, funny you would link that, I literally saw that movie yesterday.

      But yes, I write and post a Dragon Ball fanfiction on this very subreddit, so of course I have to deal with descriptions of fights, and try to make them compelling. But it's definitely harder, and as I said, it tends to not work as a proper 'show, don't tell' moment. It can be okay but you hardly will go ZOMG HOW STRONG IS THIS GUY?!? the way you could by *seeing* them in action.

        I feel like there is a meaningful axis of show vs tell here though.

        Compare "His punch was strong af" with "I could feel my ribs crack as he punched through me, as if I wasn't even there to slow him down."
        ```

          Of course there is. I just feel like even the best description falls short of how awesome a fight can *look* if done properly.

  I don't think brains vs. brawn is a fallacy, at least on larger scales. A mob has enforcers (brawn) and a boss (brain). The military has enlisted (brawn) and officers (brain). Medieval society had noble-warriors (brawn) and priestly-scholars (brain). Greek society had citizen-soldiers (brawn) and philosophers (brains). Dividing groups of humans up into "These guys do the thinking, these guys do the fighting" is a fairly time tested way to quickly sort things, and strikes me as a broadly useful heuristic. 

  What I do think is a fallacy, and the author gets at, is the idea you can rely purely on brains in all situations. There is no realistic way to convert a profound knowledge of physics into avoiding getting your ass laid out in a street fight. Real life isn't like cartoons, there won't be a convenient rube goldberg esque sequence of events you can trigger that will predictably knock out your opponents for you. This doesn't mean the protagonist needs to be capable of filling the role of brawn in the story, though. Jack Ryan illustrates this in its early episodes, were analyst Jack hangs back and lets door kickers assault terrorist strong holds. Brains did its thing finding the stronghold, now brawn does its thing clearing it out. 

  Overall I think the rationalist community under-appreciates the importance of a good goon. Quality goonry can turn a B-list brains villain into an A-lister in no time flat by coupling his mental power with physical power - just ask the Joker. You think that pencil-necked geek would be even a blip on Batman's radar if he didn't employ top shelf goons to keep Bats physically occupied?

  >Kicking down the door may be intelligent, but it does not always live up to the romantic ideal of intelligence, which is less about actually making the best choice in any given situation, and more about believing “reading books is a better use of your time than sports, scientists are always better at solving problems and winning conflicts than linebackers.” This partly feels a bit like concession to the fact that the crowd of people who read for recreation tend to be the same kind of people who spent much of their youth indoors reading books rather than flipping tires on the football field, and people like reading stories that serve and flatter their own sensibilities.

  Almost all mass media fiction is dedicated to the romantic ideal of brawn. Super heroes dominate our pop culture, and they do no thinking, no innovating, no problem solving, they just punch and fight and employ their muscles and yet somehow keep saving the world. The authors of these works need to keep inventing increasingly absurd problems that can only be solved by brawn, to justify these lunk-heads remaining employed. The real world is not lacking for tough guys who like to punch things, yet in super hero comics there is an utter drought of such individuals. The hard part of fighting crime is *solving* the crime and finding the bad guy, but that's too brainy for super heroes. So in superheroland the primary problem is in *physically apprehending* the bad guy because he's now 12 feet tall and shoots radiation out of his eyes, while the actual brain work of finding him is glossed over. 

  Or going beyond super heroes, how many movies have ended with our hero saving the day by physically beating the bad guy down? How many space battles have ended in a man on man slugging contest? How often has the villain's carefully laid out and meticulous plan been foiled by the hero charging in guns blazing, shooting everyone, and then walking off into the sunset victorious?

  By contrast the 'romantic ideal  of intelligence' is both much more rare, and yet ironically much more applicable to real life. There are some problems that can only be solved with brawn, but it's a small amount and gets smaller every day. Conversely, the amount of problems that can be solved only (or in a majority) by brains gets higher and higher every day. So seeing media that explores that side of things is refreshing and feels more plausible, even if taken to an absurd extreme of the entire world only consisting of intellectual puzzles it becomes rather silly.

    I mean, not *entirely* fair. Iron Man is a superhero by virtue of having built his own armour. That's brains and innovating. He solves (and sometimes creates!) problems through innovation. Spider-Man too is pretty clever and it often shows, if only in a vague "Hollywood science" way (which is in itself a problem, but a different one). Batman is *supposedly* the world's best detective, and he does do some detective work... from time to time. But then yeah, we just get to the part where he goes ninja on crime's ass.

      I think Iron Man illustrates my point. His suit contains multiple revolutionary technologies, that if he put his brains to it even slightly would radically improve the status quo of mankind. Does he do that? Nope. Instead, the sole purpose his technology serves is turning him into a better brawler, and any other application is a distant secondary use. Because this is a world were brawn is king, and brains are only useful insofar as they increase your punching power. See [Reed Richards is useless](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReedRichardsIsUseless) for another example of a scientist who *should* utterly change the fabric of society, but who instead just uses his technology to be better at fist fighting.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        I think that's a slightly different issue though. "Reed Richards is useless" exists not to underplay the value of brains, but to keep the world in which the stories are set relatable to us. In other words, if left unchecked, the Reed Richards/Tony Starks of the various fictional worlds would quickly turn them unrecognizable, and then we would have space opera, not superhero stories. To conveniently nerf their impact on society is a way to avoid a genre drift.

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        I mean, I can keep bringing in more equalisers based on intelligence if you want, and you can keep making the opponents more and more ridiculously improbably strong to compensate (and more and more able to avoid various strategies you'd have used to not get surrounded in the first place, likely by postulating their own intelligent puppet master) until the only solution actually _is_ to be a hulk. Won't make it have any connection to reality, of course. 

        Intelligence is strongest when it has time and resources to counter problems in advance. You don't try to mcgyver a machine to disable your opponents on the spot, you anticipate needing to deal with physical enemies, buy/machine a gun 3 years in advance, put it in your pocket and it's there when you need it. This is entirely unlike anything that happens in comics or fiction in general, of course, as there it would be totally anticlimactic if villain couldn't put protagonist in danger because protagonist was hired by DARPA and was behind 7 proxies at all times.

  I wonder if there is a similar write up of a similar concept, the skill vs. strength fallacy, would be a good name for it. It shows up in a lot of fiction that involves melee combat, in which a smaller or weaker protagonist defeats their much larger or stronger opponent through sheer skill of arms, this is however horrendously unlikely, in almost all cases of physical combat the stronger individual has an overwhelming advantage, it is *possible* to use technique to win against an opponent of superior strength, it is just incredibly unlikely, and would require near perfect execution or some rather good luck.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yes, but I would argue that it's the unlikeliness of a physically weaker hero winning that makes it interesting and worth writing about. Taking the classical example of David v Goliath, it wouldn't be a tale worth telling if Goliath casually bitch slapped David into oblivion like he did to every other opponent. St George slaying the dragon is thrilling and exciting because the odds are against him, St George being the dragon's dinner is expected and unremarkable. Stories aren't written about unremarkable events. So thats why this trope comes up in fiction so often (though I agree that due to sheer volume, it has become a cliche now)
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      Oh I absolutely agree, it is definitely a fun way to write a conflict, its the assumption that it's realistic that I was suggesting be criticized or analysed, your examples are interesting, considering David and Goliath is the prime example of Deus ex Machina.

  In many settings the rational thing to do is to become very strong. I like characters who break the iq vs strangth tradeoff trope, especially when they are on the "evil" side.

  Witcher universe has 2 of my favourite examples (Witcher 2 game and Baptism of Fire book spoilers ahead):

  >!Letho who looks like Conan, and exploits this to outsmart powerful political factions, and Vilgefortz, who looks like nerdy wizard, but mops the floor with fucking Geralt of Rivia in a melee duel.!<

  Huh, I wonder if that's why Ward is less popular than its predecessor, Worm:

  >!Taylor was a Master-type Parahuman, who needed to use complicated maneuvers and clever applications of her powers as well as finding and leveraging allies to beat opponents who were generally way stronger than her, physically.!<

  >!Meanwhile, Victoria's power is very straight-forward, even if she uses it very intelligently and with a great deal of preparation by studying everything about Parahumans that she can get her hands on.!<
  ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    I think it's less the power and more that Taylor's personality had an easier time drawing people in and seemed more sure of herself, even if, in retrospect, she wasn't necessarily healthier.

    Also, the world is less relatable, for obvious reasons.

  >The issue is that there are a lot of situations where Hulk is better at solving problems than Bruce Banner

  There are a lot only because situations are infinite.

  Proportionally physical capability (especially since good use of physical capability requires intelligence) in a society has to come up way less. That's not the same as never of course. Battles that matter usually involve armies after all, so an individual difference in physical capability is not significant.

  Really, I can think of very few scenarios Hulk can solve that you can't just hire five guys to solve instead. Except like infinite energy stuff.

  Stuff like the door is hardly a place where the Hulk would shine, sneaking into somewhere. Bruce Banner would still be better suited. A bad followup example don't you think?

  The rest of the article is pretty good.

    The Hulk however doesn't just have brawns, he has brawns on a scale beyond human comprehension. There are very few problems the Hulk couldn't solve because the Hulk simply can afford to *not give a fuck*. He doesn't need to sneak, if he's found out what are they going to do, shoot him? They can try taking hostages, I guess, but in general he's an absolutely unstoppable force of nature, a one-man army. It takes a more contrived setup to get an enemy that *can't* just have their head crushed by the Hulk and problem solved.

      They can take hostages, but hulk might just be raging enough to not care.
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Also it's a bluff. Imagine there's someone that the Hulk really cares about.

        Now imagine *killing that person right in front of the Hulk*.

        Yeah.

      >takes a more contrived setup

      Like what, literally any case where opponent isn't right in front of hulk or in a known location?
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        The opponent still has to do something to, well, *oppose* the heroes. And as far as any kind of violence is involved, there's very little the Hulk can't face head-on. Unless you have someone like Thanos, most other MCU movies would have been solved by the Hulk in five minutes flat, *at least* once he was delivered to the scene of the final battle.
        ```

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          You are assuming their goals have anything to do with the heroes *or* that there will *be* a final battle. That's story logic. Opponent is perfectly capable of achieving their goals without an army or a singular Doomsday device.
          ```

- u/Teulisch:
  ```
  these days, there is a third side to this conflict- emotion. resolution that is more about the audiences emotional response, than thinking. or more about the social values of the writer than logic. media as a way to make people agree with your views.
