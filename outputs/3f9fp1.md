## Brainstorming Rationalist Stargate [BST][MK][FF]

### Post:

Hi all, I've been lurking here for a while, and I've wanted to write some Rational Fiction for a while. 

The original plan was to do a Buffy fanfic, but over the last month, I've been re-watching Stargate SG1 with my wife, and I think I'm going to write something in the Stargate universe first. There are just sooooooooo many times the idiot ball is passed around, and so many missed opportunities.

So I've been taking some [notes](https://workflowy.com/s/hEJRmJvKKL)

So, from the perspective of someone finding out about the Stargate after Atlantis is over, there are three main questions:

1. How did the universe get here? This is the main puzzle to be figured out for my character, as there are things about the universe that would be very confusing. Examples:
 * How is it the Goa'uld and their armies are so incompetent? 
 * What is up with the Wraith? How does the feeding work? 
 * Why didn't the Asgard just upload into android bodies? 
 * Why haven't they developed better security for the SGC? 

2. What's the quickest path to post-scarcity? My notes above are mostly about missed opportunities. A few options:
 * Ascension - They have found a few DNA resequencers that are built for this, but they aren't particularly safe. 
 * Nox - Seem to be here, just don't like Earth's warlike nature. Maybe they can be convinced?
 * Time Dilation Fields - they have found this tech a few times, but it was handed over to them at the end of the season. Build research bases inside these and have them export tech. 
 * There is an ancient repository that uploads all their tech into your brain. It kills you eventually, because our brain can't handle that much but they now have the tech to remove (and store) the memories. So they should be able to build ZPMs, pretty much infinite power generation.
 * Time travel and Alternate realities. We should be able to build self-replicating harvesters that go back in time and collect people (in the form of full-body scans) from all timelines right before death.
 
3. Are there any credible threats left?
 * Most reasonable is the replicators. If they are intelligent at all, they have sent ships to lots of other galaxies and gateless planets.
 * Goa'uld have very different utility function, and are capable of great intelligence (despite holding lots of idiot balls)
 * Wraith have few ships left, but above is true for them too.

  Not a Stargate fan, particularly, but I found [this](http://archiveofourown.org/works/3673335) terribly amusing.

  And the reason the Goa'uld are incompetent is because competent interstellar war is a galactic existential threat. Oh, you mean an in-story reason? Um, "Anthropic Principle".

  I don't really care for reaching for uploaded computronium supertech dyson sphere, etc status that should rationally comes with SG-1 acquiring all those technology and munchkin. Really, there's too much supertech available to Earth for research. It should be harder and much rarer, or else the story transforms Earth into an unrecognizable technological civilization.

  Make the story limited and the narrative bigger. Less focus on SG-1, and more focus on SGC as an organization, with some view on world politics.

  Plan for public disclosure, even if the disclosure event was unplanned. They should have plans of some kind as to how to inform the public.

  Exploration should be slower and more careful. More use of drones and MALPs.

  How do the Chinese and Russian go along with the US? What is Earth's policy for defense? Why don't Earthlings screw each other over? What treaties are there? What arrangements are made, and so on.

  I think that a rational story would make things more realistic for everyone. Stargate gives out idiot balls to everyone, not just the heroes. They also have several Hollywood tropes that are very unrealistic.

  For the SGC, they would have a plan for disclosure and actually use it. If they did not, then it would be disclosed anyway and they would lose control over how it was done. Captain Carter is a great astrophysics person, but she is not a superhuman AI. This means that she does not solve every problem, she has a specialty and her problems are solved in a matter of weeks or months, not minutes. (This is true of Daniel as well.) In addition to this, the greatest advantage of science is numbers and freedom not individual science heroes. This means a secret investigation will lack both and will therefore be very slow. This is another reason to favor disclosure.

  For the Goa'uld, they are made incompetent for better TV. The sarcophagus can give them brain damage, but their numbers and the length of time they have been alive will lead to better technology. Their technology should be so advanced that the SGC cannot distinguish it from magic without assistance. (The ease by which technology is learned comes from Hollywood's inability to understand large numbers.) Remember that they are supposed to have been technologically advanced for thousands of years. Even if they advanced slower than Earth did, their technology will still be orders of magnitude better than when they started. Also, their actions will (and canonically did) take account of advanced worlds and enemies. So when Apophis arrived in his ships, he would start bombing right away - perhaps while sending a message. He would not wait in orbit until the heroes defeat him.

  For the other races in general, there seems to be a common trend of either ignoring their existence or the aliens simply giving everything to Earth. Exceptions to that are rare. This is simply not realistic. Advanced aliens are their own people with their own agenda. They will also act in the galaxy even when the main characters are not looking.

  As for the Earth, the US has no reason to give up the stargate. At the same time, early disclosure will not lead to that. The US is a member of the Security Council and is capable of simply rejecting any claims they do not like. Furthermore, operating from the United Nations gives the US a way to represent their operations as being "from the Earth as a whole", even though they retain control of the stargate and the operations of it. Furthermore, disclosure will not lead to public panic unless it is uncontrolled during a Goa'uld attack. A controlled disclosure will lead to wonder and determination. The worst possibility is the formation of cults that worship Goa'uld, and such cults would not be popular.

  For the advanced races, their technology should be so advanced that the SGC has no hope of understanding how it works. Their first order of business should be new theories of physics, not new guns. The SGC attempting to understand to understand Asgard technology should be even worse than a caveman attempting to understand how a modern laptop works. The SGC's first priority should therefore be gaining new science teachers, alien science textbooks and other science information to speed up their progress. Disclosure should happen as soon as possible in order to gain the resources of the world rather than a tiny section of the United States. I cannot emphasize how advanced the science and technology really should appear to us. Captain Carter and all of the scientists in world should be unable to crack Asgard technology no matter how long they investigate it.

    > The sarcophagus can give them brain damage, but their numbers and the length of time they have been alive will lead to better technology.

    Especially because the sarcophagus just makes humans, at least, more of a selfish asshole and not any dumber. It's possible that the effect doesn't apply to Goa'uld, and it's possible that Goa'uld can heal any damage to themselves or their hosts that results from the sarcophagus. There is speculation in one episode that sarcophagus usage is a key differentiating factor between the Goa'uld and the Tok'ra, but as far as I can tell, it's just one bit of throwaway speculation.

    If the sarcophagus devices only have ill effects on humans, Goa'uld might not care at all. Turning a host evil when that host already has no ability to exercise their will -- it just doesn't matter.

    > problems are solved in a matter of weeks or months, not minutes.

    Likewise, languages are analyzed in a matter of months. Daniel Jackson doesn't automatically understand a language just because a human is speaking it. I'd understand if everyone at SGC had to learn at least conversational Goa'uld and the Goa'uld demanded that their slaves could all speak and understand the language. (In my personal canon, everyone at SGC knows the primary language in use by system lords, and Daniel Jackson knows the three or four minor languages used by system lords.)

    > Their first order of business should be new theories of physics, not new guns.

    It depends. When the Goa'uld are beating on your door, you want guns. The more safety you have, the further you anticipate the attack to be, the further up the chain you can go. If you've got a year, you might just want enough technical knowledge to start mass producing weapons. If you have a decade, you want the science too.
    ```

    - u/KZLightning:
      ```
      I would probably expect that conversational Goa'uld functions as a trade language within their empire and in any nearby systems. So having everyone in the SGC learn conversational Goa'uld would probably be required. (Right now, the US teaches languages for the military in an intensive two year program. So I would expect something like that to be required for everyone.)

      As for guns, you are right that they need that right away. The problem is that any guns they need they probably cannot use. The energy requirements are likely too high. If not, then actually setting them would be a huge engineering problem. So while they want guns, they would probably have to settle for hand weapons (staff weapons, zats and the like). Space weapons would probably require a third party to defend Earth's space while Earth learns advanced physics and how to build our own weapons.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    The idea of Anubis as the hero is exellent! I think I'm going to steal that.

    Ascending doesn't seem to equal being fully actualized. Many Ascended beings have descended in order to fulfill their goals. I'm thinking that the current set of ascended have acted against enough people's interests to qualify as an enemy. 

    If, as a group, they care about intelligent life, why aren't they ascending everyone on death?

  I'm going to assume that you're not going to even try reconciling the last-of-his-species-Ra, only-two-gates-halfway-across-the-known-universe of the classic Stargate movie with the later canon.

  Regarding 1a:

  * The Goa'uld are parasites with generally low creativity and one-dimensional personality. According to the Stargate Wikia, at least, Cronus and Ra acted out pretty much the same routines for 10K years; Apophis and (especially) Ba'al were outliers in that regard.

  * Ra "went shopping" for humans around 10,500 BC. The Goa'uld keep them at a Neolithic(?) tech level, brainwash them into thinking Goa'uld are gods over generations with "miracles" of stolen tech, and only fight among each other in a lazy feudal power system where everyone in charge is long-lived family; you have a recipe for exactly what we see: militaries optimized so the slaves can't rebel successfully most of the time, "soldiers" equipped to inflict fear and not be particularly effective, and ships designed to save their own scaly tails.

  * **The Goa'uld are, literally, brain-damaged.** The Sarcophagus has the nasty side effect of inducing megalomania with repeated (especially unnecessary) usage, canonically, which was one of the reasons why the Tok'ra, who used it stingily if at all, had such different results in their utility function. I would think a sane SGC wouldn't use it unless necessary, once they acquired one and if learned of the side effects. 

  1b: I have no damn clue how it works, given that the Wraith can consciously reverse the process, giving more 'lifeforce' to their target. Supposedly the Ancients tried coming up with a non-Ascension form of immortality, using baseline humans an the Iratus bug. *shrug*

  1c. Perhaps the Asgard were too concerned that the Replicators would hack their new android/gynoid/is-there-even-a-genderless-version-wordoid bodies? They couldn't even secure their own ships. As for before encountering the the pesks...no idea. The ancient races overall seem badly written.

  1d. They were pretty quick to create and install the Iris, even as of the second episode. Pretty sure they upgraded it later, when they discovered new materials. I don't see a good reason why they didn't use that "Canadian SG-1" fic's simple solution of turning the gate horizontal after O'Neil was basically trapped offworld by one until he could dig out.

  2\. Post-scarcity stuff

  * Ascension wouldn't do a lot of good anyway, since the majority of the Ascended beings don't permit interfering with the "lower plane" often.

  * The Nox rightly see humanity as "too young" to deal with.

  * Time Dilation Fields would require a) people to leave their families for subjectively long periods, isolating them or b) basically setting-and-forgetting type assembly lines and timer-operated experiments. Could work, I suppose.

  * There were at least four Ancient Repositories. Two would stuff your head with so much data that you would have little-to-no conscious executive function left not-overwritten, a third out of date with an immediately-lethal-to-humans normal access method (Destiny's) and a fourth (Merlin's) that actually had a virtual interface to assist. The Asgard had thousands of years to study a "small portion" of the newer version, and "only scratched the surface". The problem with Merlin's machine would be *knowing what to look for*, still not an easy task, and we're assuming here that the Ascended beings didn't simply destroy that one after the Sangraal had been used against the Ori.

  * Time travel is an unbounded number of security breaches and existence failures not waiting around to have been going to be later simultaneously happening all at once. Smart!RepliCarter would automatically win, once she figured that out.

  3\. Credible threats left after the destruction of the Ori? Whether the Replicators are still a threat is dependant on if those in the Milky Way were able to transmit the disruptor frequency used on Dekara.  There were seven of the Asuran human-form Replicators left inactive from exposure to space in Pegasus, but that's all, and the Wraith aren't stupid enough to reactivate the weapons proven so successful against them in the past. The Goa'uld, frankly, are best simply hunted down and eliminated. Permanently.

  The Lucian Alliance would be the most interesting opponent, I think. They're mostly humans who had suffered under Goa'uld rule who snatched up the infrastructure for themselves and turned to (mostly) organized crime -- not nearly as easy to "hide behind calculations" for the Kinsey-types upstairs.


  Bonus from your other list: the Tok'ra did mention that the Goa'uld communication devices were not secure; however, SG-1 first encountered the devices in the final episode of the 1st season, and didn't meet the Tok'ra until the 11th episode of the 2nd season. Lot of time for leaking intel if the SGC were to use them.

  How exactly do goa'ulds control their host anyways? From my understanding they interfere with the motor signals coming from the brain by wrapping around the spinal cord and doing...what? if they cut the spinal cord, the host will probably die, right? do they control the direction of the signal(s) coming from the brain? if so, how do they control what signals are sent in the first place? Do they just stop all motor signals that they don't want, until the human host gives in and gives them the motor signal they want? But if the human decides not to move at all, or to only move a little bit, so they only do small simple movements, how would the goa'uld control them then?

  It seems like the goua'ld would have to control the brain itself, by inhibiting some connections and promoting others. But if this happens, the hosts themselves would be changed by that. Also, what happens to the host when they enter a sarcophagus? Shouldn't the host ALSO develop megalomania?

  TBH, I suspect that the megalomania caused by the sarcophagus actually was meant as an anti-immortality plot device.

  The goauld's brains are too small to be sapient. Maybe what the goa'uld does is alter the host's utility function in some way that is beneficial to it. I think they alter the host's utility function to make them power-hungry. Maybe goauld are kind of like fungi and they're more concerned with what will allow as much of their offspring to germinate as possible, rather than the more human motivation of survival and family. So the goauld make their hosts power hungry in order to gain access to more resources, more food, and more hosts for their offspring. Ultimately they want all humans to be jaffa and to make as many jaffa who live as long as possible, so that they can maximize their germinated offspring.

  I think the goauld should be fungal, not reptillian. The only reason they were snakes in the first place was because snakes are considered satanic.

  Of course, if the goauld are fungi rather than snakes, that eliminates the ancient egyptian conection.

  Why are all the aliens from human mythology anyway? It's like humans aren't even CAPABLE of making things up.

  I would say this implies a heavy level of interaction between humans and the other sapient races. If the humans are the ancestors of the ancients and the ancients are time travellers, that might explain why they are taking a special interest. The ancients are reclusive, so if they want to communicate with the ancients, they leave a record with the ancestors of the ancients...

  An alt explanation is that ALL of the advanced aliens are descendants of humans or other earth creatures from the future. This would make more sense with how the gouald would be fungus (or even snakes like in canon), and why the azguard are humanoid and look and talk like humans. It would explain why everyone speaks english or at least some language that Daniel is actually capable of translating. It would also explain how the gouauld could be semi-sapient with such small brains; technological advances that improve their brain's efficiency, or maybe their brains are made of nanotech rather than normal brain cells, so they actually have room for a full-sized brain in their tiny bodies.

  Also, take out the glowing eyes thing. :P

    I recall a scene at soime point where it was explained that the many people in the galkaxy actually are descended from (past) humans, and Sam points out that humans evolved on Earth and did not comer from elsewhere, to which the reply was that this means the Earth is the ancestral source of the human race.

    In other words, it's already canon that at least large portions of the galaxy *are* descended from Earth beings.
