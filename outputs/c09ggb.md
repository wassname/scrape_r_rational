Anyone know what happened to S.I. by datapacrat? Was it dropped?

  Here's a link to the Google Docs with the index of all ten of the books for anyone who wants to read them: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1\_ZcUba\_GKVCm\_i2VeGrfSBBxC8pR6VZC5VBBUVKKxYk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_ZcUba_GKVCm_i2VeGrfSBBxC8pR6VZC5VBBUVKKxYk/edit)

  I think the books are planned to be continued, but datapacrat is probably spending some time away from it to work on other projects.
