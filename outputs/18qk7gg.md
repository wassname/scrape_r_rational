## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Wanted to rec [Patriarch](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46292428/chapters/116546815) by TheMormegil, the first and only Mother of Learning fic I've ever read, and a surprisingly good one at that. 

  Patriarch is a direct continuation of the events of MoL with the premise of "resolving unfinished character arcs". On the surface, the story is like what you would expect from the title and premise, a straightforward romance power fantasy fic whose main concern is which shallowly depicted teenager will the mysterious secret archmage badass end up with while founding his own Great House. Underneath that though, it's asking a question that I've never seen before: how socially stunted would a time looper be after spending so much time not having to take into account how his interactions will matter beyond a 1 month horizon? After being able to wipe the slate clean after every fuckup? 

  Gradually we see Zorian's small fuck ups and minor oversights--stuff that he's never had to worry much about before-- snowball into larger and larger problems which will not go away by simply waiting and ignoring them, and which, even with prodigious skills, he can't simply solve, not without either compromising his principles or changing his priorities and growing as a person. 

  It's an insightful take on the looping trope that's being explored alongside the more "fanservice" elements and I'm completely on board. My only caveat is that at first I felt Zorian was a bit too out of character, but the author improved with every chapter and after only a few I felt he was very close to nailing the tone and feel of Zorian and MoL. Props to the author for the idea and the execution, I really hope he sticks with it to the end.

    This was just... blegh. There's an extreme dearth of MoL followup fic, I guess, but. I don't want to read about an autistic version of Zorian trying and failing to navigate basic social interactions and engaging in comedies of misunderstanding with the women in his life. 

    How can he have money problems? "Spell formulas are just too advanced to take to market" is just not that compelling a problem for his character to have. How can his parents consistently pop up just in time to cause him to socially pratfall? They're not mages. They can't teleport. 

    There are interesting moments in this fic. But they're constantly undercut by Zorian's inability to grok basic human interaction and plot-driving "problems" that are the narrative equivalent of a character banging his shin on something. At a certain point it just reads like a diminishment of what we know this character is actually capable of.

    Beyond his social incompetence, though, he also dives headfirst over the moral event horizon line he drew up for himself in canon by mind-reading and -controlling just about everyone he can if they aren't his in-circle. And the way that developed might deserve a few paragraphs of its own, but I've hit my rant-reward sweet spot here, I think. 

    Can't recommend this myself, unfortunately, even given how thin on the ground MoL material is.

      Good to know I made the right decision dropping it after two chapters.

    Reading the first chapters, I found the characterization of not only Zorian, but of everyone else, pretty weird. Seeing your thoughts, I'll try to push through. 

    To be honest, the only fanfic where I've found Zorian's voice acceptable is the Worm/Brandon Sanderson/Steven Universe/MoL crossover, and he's just a secondary character there.
    I will post the link and name if I remember it.

    Edit: Thanks ahasuerus!

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      Like I said, I felt it took the author a few chapters to get a better handle on the characters and setting. It has been years since I read the original though, so I'm curious to see if other people's impressions will match mine. Let me know what you think after you've read further.
      ```

      - u/steelong:
        ```
        I'm at chapter 12, and it hasn't gotten that much better to me. I'd say it matches mid-MoL slightly more than end-MoL Zorian. By the end of MoL, Zorian could fully hive-mind with his simulacrums so that he effectively had a single multi-threaded consciousness. In this story, he's dealing with simulacrum personality drift that Zorian had pretty much overcome by the end of the story if I remember right.

        He is also doing a lot of things using his own identity that seem like they would have gone better if he had used disguises instead. In fairness, book Zorian did the same sometimes, but I feel like he was better at using his true identity sparingly.

        Edit: I read a bit further and kind of gave up. Zorian repeatedly takes pointless risks with the intention of covering things up by chucking around mind magic. It feels like the author really wants to write a overpowered character flaunting that power to humiliate authority figures that think they're untouchable. It's also a lazy way to set up further conflicts.

        I get that the stated point of the story is to show Zorian struggling with long-term consequences after being able to ignore anything past a month for so long, but here he's even getting lazy about short-term consequences. 

        If you want the power fantasy mixed in with romantic obliviousness, though, you might find it fun. Not my cup of tea.

  The Ghosts of Christmas wanted to drop some TV show recs. 

  Why are there more than 3 recs, you ask? Well, maybe there're more Ghosts than we've so far been made aware of.

  *(don't read hidden spoilers before watching the relevant show)*

  ###1 [*Travelers*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Travelers) by Brad Wright & Co

  * Excellent TT-related worldbuilding, to the point that it felt unbelievable that not only would they greenlight something so nuanced for a TV show, but also that it would manage to keep getting new seasons, and those seasons in turn would manage to maintain the quality mark for so long.
  * Great characters / actors:
   * Excellent background characters, especially the other time-travelers (>!e.g. Bloom, the ones on the bus!<)
   * Great actors for the foregrounds characters
   * Overall, a character's depiction is usually very detailed and often features a nuanced touch here and there
  * Great plot — no stupid decisions driving towards drama / pre-designed plot (AFAIK, at least most of the time)
  * Has one of the best antags I've seen so far>!, with a really touching / compelling backstory!< >!(Ingram)!<
  * (spoiler, kinda) Just look at how gorgeous [this](https://files.catbox.moe/0sd3mt.webm) scene is and how much of a detailed lore background it represents (S02E09 start).

  ###2 [*Haunting of Hill House, The*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6763664/) by Mike Flanagan

  * The best horror show I've watched so far. Bonus points for not just being one-dimensional — isn't just a horror exploitation, but manages to be something more; a genuine, stand-alone story of its own. >!Dare I say, even wholesome.!<
  * Has a good and diverse character-cast
  * Doesn't play the horror tropes completely straight (even if the subversion isn't too original either)

  -

  ###3 [*Devs*](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/Devs) by Alex Garland

  PROs / misc:

  * Religious themes are both the strong (uniqueness, atmosphere, aesthetics, speculative value) and weak (internal inconsistency) points of the story.
  * Good soundtrack, although I felt like it would've benefited more if it veered a tiny bit closer to Zimmer / Koyaanisqatsi.
  * Visual / audial aesthetics
  * Lyndon's character. Honestly, I think the story would've been much more interesting if it were focused around him as the MC. Would've been easier to steer the plotline without making it lose congruence too.
  * The general premise, genre, and (even if still somewhat problematic) approach to time travel mechanics — without as much of a heavy-handed use of "timey-wimey" technobabble copouts that often get used in other works dealing with similar premise-building tropes.

  Cons:

  * Felt like the writer struggled to concoct a fitting end for the story, one that would also take care of all the loose ends and hinted implications / plot devices that were used throughout the episodes.
  * The >!predetermination!< gets used as a handwave too much. 
   * The problem with the plot is also not as much that >!their timeline is predetermined and they have to repeat the actions shown in the machine, but those actions themselves. It was like if the narration said that a machine with infinite computational power was used to generate three best possible masterpieces of music, and then the actual songs you got to hear weren't even of average quality, but of those poorly played, meme-value Titanic themes.!< >!Predeterminism / lack of free will / prophecy!< basically gets used to excuse stupid decisions again and again so much it just starts being lazy writing by that point.
  * The >!perfect loop explanation!< maybe could've worked if you thought about the un-elaborated mechanics well enough, but then they had to go and hamstring their own explanation in the last episode.
  * The main character felt flat and boring to me. In terms of personality, lack of told-not-shown abilities (e.g. her supposed intelligence), lack of sympathy-worthy moral build (her treatment of her ex-bf, no explanation about why she dumped him like that), etc.
   * I felt like she didn't deserve the artificial shoehorning into the main plot and its scenes, didn't deserve the plot armor that carried her all the way through the story and its ending both.
  * the company's head of security was pretty much an RPG character; the fight scenes operated on RPG mechanics / logic.

  ###4 [*OA, The*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635282/) by Brit Marling, Zal Batmanglij & Co

  Pros:

  * Powerful visual / audial aesthetics, >!really strong chareographed dance scenes!<
  * Non-trivial character interactions, dynamics
  * Great actors

    Second the rec for Travelers. I expected it was just going to be anther one of those high-concept mystery box shows with incoherent worldbuilding and plot twists, but it was much more than it appeared at first.
    ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    Travelers is great. The tension of the Travelers who possess the bodies and lives of those who they sorta-murdered is fantastic, and all the consequences of living lives they don't know much about is a real treat. To bad it ended.

  Does anyone have any metametafiction? I feel like I see metafiction enough that I now want fiction about fiction about fiction.

  I've recently been reading a chinese historical fiction webnovel called Mediterranean Hegemon of Ancient Greece. It has plenty of flaws, but I can feel the author's enthusiasm for history and that makes it charming to me.

    I don't know of any meta-metafiction, but I'll always take the opportunity to recommend the excellent [Arrogant Young Master](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4), a xianxia satire with a genre savvy SI protagonist.

    There was that weird Worth the Candle fanfic posted a while ago by gazemaize. It was... weird, but it's definitely pretty far down the rabbit hole of meta.

      I actually don't really like metafiction that much, and that's why I was kinda looking for stories poking fun at it.

      [Worth the Candle](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25137/worth-the-candle) is quite popular on this sub.

      [The Adventures of Rania Mortal the Perfectly Normal Elf](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59503/the-adventures-of-rania-mortal-the-perfectly-normal) is pretty funny sometimes.

      [Zeroth Moment](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/70672/zeroth-moment-my-cheat-skill-is-stupid-so-ill) is mostly standard subversion/reconstruction, but I get a metafiction vibe from it at times.

      [Isekai, Go Home! An Anti-Isekai Inquisition Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/isekai-go-home-an-anti-isekai-isekai-fantasy-inquisition-quest.97686/) is also amusing. I think it is only on Questionable Questing currently.

  Required tags: Adventure

  Excluded tags: Romance, Crossover, OP protagonist, Slow burn

  Status: Complete

  Order by: favorites (NOT likes, there's a difference)

  I'm provisionally willing to read fics in any fandom, but am increasingly persnickety about writing quality. I want stuff. That's, ideally, one professional editor away from being publishable.

    I have some published fiction that I think is great. No fanfiction that I think quite meet your request. 

    [The Dandelion Dynasty](https://www.simonandschuster.com/series/The-Dandelion-Dynasty) is a story set in a fantasy China-esque nation with gods who only meddle and don't overtly act in the wars of the mortals. It has romance in it, but the romance isn't the main focus at all. 

    [Under Heaven](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7139892-under-heaven) is along the same vein. Set in a fantasy China-esque world with a bit of magic, but only a bit.

    [The Years of Rice and Salt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2723.The_Years_of_Rice_and_Salt#:~:text='The%20Years%20of%20Rice%20and,network%20of%20Islamic%20city%20states.) is an alternate history Earth. To be honest, I can understand if people find some sections boring, but I think *Book Four: The Alchemist* is the section that everyone, especially people on this sub, should read.
