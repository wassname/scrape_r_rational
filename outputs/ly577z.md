  I once posted this comic to here when it was finished, and 8 months later, the epilogues have just been posted. So here I am again reposting it to here.

  It's a comic about time travel, eldritch monsters, clones, and lots of investigating and deduction to figure out confusing rules behind reality. Some romance and competency in dealing with emotions as well for those who are interested in that sort of thing.

  Jack is planning to clean up and edit grammar errors as well as missing pictures, so if you want to wait a few more weeks, the quality should be improved, but it'll be minor stuff. The plot is set and there's no way he'll be rewriting anything into a second draft.

    Holy cow man congrats, that comic has been going on for years now and I can't even imagine the relief you have to be done with it. Any future projects or will you be taking a break for now?

      AHAHAHAHA!!!!!

      I wish I was this creative, dedicated, or talented, but no I'm not the author.

      Jack talks about his future plans in the author's notes if you want to know.

        Oh, that makes sense, glad to find another reader also staying up late to read that last chapter with me, I'll miss having it to look forward to every day but it was a good ending.

  I love this comic but man is it intense.

  Don’t binge you’ll get burnout.

  All Night Laundry is great. Someone recommended it here as it was wrapping up and I devoured it all in like a fortnight or something. A simple comparison would be its like Homestuck if 80% of the content was cut out, and thus not a giant clusterfuck and instead a much more digestible and engaging story about (similarly to Homestuck) averting a time travel related apocalypse from an innocuous beginning point, puzzling out everyone else's motivations and goals, and also hitting on notes of relationships, identity, family, dreams, and ambition. Please read it.

  Also the intentional changing and evolution of the art and aesthetics over time is neat too.

    So I'm up to page 80, and one thing I hope this has in common with Homestuck is that it eventually ditches the "interactive" concept. While I'm sure it was fun when the comic was still ongoing, as a new reader of the completed work, I find it really immersion-breaking.

  I've read a bit more than a third of the way through and I don't think I will be continuing. 

  I haven't found it to be particularly "rational". The mysteries are vaguely science themed, and they talk about pop quantum physics things like Schrodinger's cat and the double slit experiment, but that does not make a "rational" story.

  The biggest sin is that a large number of scenes, perhaps even an actual majority of scenes (in what I've read so far), can be described as "character(s) are trapped while scary monster slowly approaches, then a deus ex machina rescues them after they suffer some severe injury". That's almost the polar opposite of "rational fiction".

  Plus the characters are unrealistically psychologically resilient, but that's par for the course for horror.

  It's really impossible to understate how well written this multimedia webcomic is. Its just so damn cool, the art is great, and the plot is tight as hell. It's also the only piece of fiction I've read with time travel where a)the time travel is done well b) the rules of time travel are consistent and well explained and c) the time travel shenanigans don't become incredibly tiresome.

  Also, the webcomic makes use of the website format to do some really unique interactive things that I can't honestly say I've seen anywhere else.

  Before I get started, does anyone know if this story functions properly on mobile?
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    Yes I believe so.

  I tried to read this story, and I enjoyed it at first. A new character was introduced later on, and Bina and her companion were really annoying together, their sense of humor was just...ugh. It was a slog to get through those chapters and I eventually dropped it.

  I'm still not entirely sure why Bina alone was likable, but Bina + companion was annoying. Weird, but I'm probably the only one who felt that way, lol.
