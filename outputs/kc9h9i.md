    From a meta viewpoint, I think the problem is that if I spent whole chapters on my characters musing philosophy, this would become quite a different story. Not necessarily an *uninteresting* one, just a different one. I've considered delving fully into that notion, but if I were to write a rational fiction about the philosophy of the afterlife, I think it would be a Bleach fanfiction, not a Dragon Ball one. I say this because Bleach has both a higher focus on the afterlife and a ridiculously oblivious attitude to just how *shitty* its afterlife is for pretty much anyone. Also, I like the idea of Ichigo as a rational hero focused on this issue - he's canonically pretty smart, albeit not a genius, and he's grown up in a clinic, with a doctor as a father, seeing death up close (and then ghosts) from childhood.

    From an in-story viewpoint: while they know there is an afterlife, they also are really ignorant about how do you go one place or the other. There is not a holy text or a prophet's word. Bulma, at the very least, knows she's doomed to Hell no matter what, and that's simply because Enma is pissed off with her personally. Baba learned about Enma and tried her best to butter him up, and that obsession actually ended putting her in a worse spot than she started from. I may have made these world-shattering revelations sound too trivial, I'll admit, but in general my idea here is that knowing that there is an afterlife but also a capricious deity who decides if you go to Heaven or Hell based on unknown and arbitrary rules takes the edge off many of those questions. Such as, killing someone at the height of their virtue to have them go to Heaven might sound like a *good* thing... but then again, will it send *you* to Hell because that's how Enma thinks, regardless of your good intentions? How do you even tell if that person will go to Heaven anyway? Really, the fact that Enma has *mood swings* suggests he could send the same exact person to Heaven one day, to Hell the next, simply based on how he feels that day.

        Well, blowing up a planet doesn’t just kill everyone, it also destroys a whole culture, history etc. and stops it from ever going on. I would say that’s still a net loss, even if everyone went to heaven. But you’re right that I might bring that up - but there will be plenty of time once I get to the Frieza arc (which will actually be sooner than you might expect).

        Also, speaking of one shots and Bleach, I *did* write one, “End of Empiricism”. That one was about the problem of connecting our senses with reality, though. But I am also considering something short along the lines said above.

  This time back on FF.net, since its issues seem to be finally solved! As usual though, if someone prefers it, [here is the AO3 mirror](https://archiveofourown.org/works/14091411/chapters/68709117).

  Very good chapter.

  >!I 'm happy that you didn't drag out the fight too long. !<

  >!Now I assume Goku will get mecha-eyes?!<

  >!But I see a little issue here. Goku winning with Tao means that he is now stronger than Crane Master and his underlings as well, right?!<
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Not really. In canon >!Goku beats Tao much more comfortably than here - after training with Korin - and still has trouble and eventually loses against Tien at the next Tenkaichi. But regardless, I also didn't really stick to canon power levels all the time (for example, I made Bandages and Spike significantly weaker than they should have been - in theory, THEY are stronger than Tao too, since in canon Goku fights them after him). As a general rule, in this world, Tao and Tien are both stronger than the Crane master and Chiaotzu. I won't pronounce myself on who's stronger between Tao and Tien though; the former had more experience, the latter is more of a rising young talent.!<
    ```

    - u/Dezoufinous:
      ```
      For me, this is a common issue in all kinds of fiction, including Bleach as well. Power levels are not consistent and hero always barely wins and learns something, what always makes me wonder "what if he fought his opponents in a different order". 

      It's the same with fighting games, the opponents are always magically one step above the player. The real question is how to rationalize it.

      >!You have kinda written Tao as best world fighter (assasin) and Crane as kinda scared of Tao. Tien and Chiaotzu are Crane's pupils, so I would think they are way weaker than him. It's suprising that you're saying "Tien is stronger than Crane", is it the same as in canon?!<
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        The question is never settled straightforwardly in canon, but I believe that >!by the point Goku and Tien fight, they're both stronger than their respective masters. Goku barely loses against Roshi in his PREVIOUS tournament. He powers up a lot since then, and Roshi has no reason to grow much more, since he's so old and has basically peaked his potential. Then Roshi surrenders against Tien, basically saying that it's better if his old generation leaves the field to the young ones. He's acknowledging that he's been surpassed: there's new, fresh blood now. And there's no reason to think Shen is much stronger than him. I think at one point Roshi tells Tien that he's surpassed his master and should not feel bound by his will any more.!<

  should be

  >"Of course Tao Pai Pai would be *capable* of such feats of meditation!"

  Another awesome chapter, your fight scenes continue to be amazing. 

  I do wonder what will happen to Goku's eyes now. The dragonball universe doesn't have much in terms of regrowing body parts (outside inborn abilities for some species and, of course, the dragonballs), does it?

  Thank you for the chapter, I was happy to read it.

  A minor technical question, just to help me complete my mental picture of the fight. How did Goku do the move >!with the Pinecones? !<I feel like I can visualize almost the whole fight except for that part, because I can kind of imagine several ways he could do it, but I'm not sure which one he used.
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    Basically the idea is, Goku has become really good at delicate ki control. Look up for example Yamcha's Sokidan technique; what he's doing is something like that, but with very small blasts, and no need for large gestures to control them. So in this case what he did was:

    1. use small, faint blasts as explosions to propel pinecones towards Tao from direction A;  
    2. hide some brighter blast behind one such cone, so that it would blind Tao when the cone itself was deflected;  
    3. use the diversion to then get to land in an attack from a completely different direction, where he was actually hiding.

    As for how he could get the blasts in position while keeping them hidden, with enough time and patience there would be several methods. He could delicately slip them under the first layer of leaves and soil of the forest's floor, or have them go vertically from his position, up above the tree cover, so that they might be ignored or simply look like planes or satellites flying overhead without a closer inspection while they move, then have them come down in position.
    ```

      ```
      Ah it was #1 I wasn’t quite sure how it worked somehow, the other two parts made sense. Thank you for the explanation and the chapter!

  Hi, just wanted to drop a quick note right here were I'm sure you'll read it. I really enjoy the story, the divergence from canon, how you grew some side characters, and the worldbuilding you are doing. The good mix between RATIONAL characters, simple smart/rational characters and strongly emotional characters.     
  The story flows well, because for all the good communication most main characters have, there are a lot of normal miscommunication, unsaid things, normal human failings.        
  This is the perfect rational fic for me, some very smart characters, some more normal ones, not everyone is a Machiavellian mastermind, not everyone thinks at 30 levels deep, and even "simple" characters can have valuable input both in story and in the meta message.- 

  Please, continue this as well as you can, because it is one of the most satisfactory rational-DB fics I enjoyed ...
