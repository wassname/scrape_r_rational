  There's munchkinry that comes from thinking outside the plot (like [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2lyuhh/mk_that_guy_destroys_psionics/)), and then there's munchkinry that comes from roleplaying so hard that you accidentally break the universe. This is a story of the latter type, about a Vietnam-scarred old man who just wants to get his lawn gnomes back.

  This story is the original inspiration for [the Henderson Scale of Plot Derailment](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/The_Henderson_Scale_of_Plot_Derailment). Quite a long read, but definitely worth it, especially if you like chaos and dislike apocalypse-inducing Elder Gods.

  ```
  Minor nitpick: the main antagonist is actually Hastur, not Cthulhu. Unless you meant to refer to Call of Cthulhu instead.

  I read that yesterday, after This Guy Destroys Psionics, and I think this is ridiculously awesome.
