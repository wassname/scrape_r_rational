  I was reading the article that this one is somewhat of a response to, ["How to Write a Character Smarter Than You"](https://medium.com/@MrGrahamMoore/how-to-write-about-characters-who-are-smarter-than-you-c7c956944847#.9k25dhbq3), by the guy who wrote the screenplay for "The Imitation Game", when I started thinking that he was just talking about giving the *aesthetic impression of* intelligence instead of *actual* intelligence, and going to Arthur Conan Doyle when you could just go to the things Turing actually wrote was kind of dumb ...

  And then I realized that I had actually read that article [on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vwa0c/crosspost_from_rwriting_how_to_write_about/) and [already voiced my opinions there](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2vwa0c/crosspost_from_rwriting_how_to_write_about/colgzzi). So I guess I don't need to repeat myself.

  As for writing dumber characters, poor impulse control is definitely a part of it, but simply not seeing optimal solutions is a bigger part, and one of the hardest parts to get right.

  Someone who is dumber than you will arrive at *less optimal solutions*, even when they have enough time that impulse control isn't an issue. This is difficult to model, because once you've seen an optimal solution, nonoptimal ones look ridiculous (and they tend to look *equally* ridiculous even if they're at varying levels of difficulty).

  I've known plenty of dumb people in my time, and if you see them doing something dumb they'll give you an explanation that makes sense to them. If you point out a smarter way of doing things, often they'll say, "Oh, yeah, that's better" and switch over (though sometimes they'll say "But this is how I've always done it" or "This is simpler" and then there's not much you can do).

  Poor impulse control is one way to model dumbness, but I would argue that it's not even that necessary to what you're trying to write about.

  The best way to properly model a dumb person is probably to get a dumb person to study so that you can convincingly portray their actions and thoughts, but that goes for almost any character you might want to write about.

    Ah, I like the idea of dumb people still optimizing but doing so within a constrained set of options or ideas. I'm assuming most people, to themselves, see themselves as picking good/reasonable decisions. They didn't consider a great solution, then pick a bad one. They considered several solutions and picked the one they thought was best with the tools at their disposal, including their ability to think up of and evaluate solutions.

    It's definitely a problem. I can do "me if I were sad" or "someone who believes that character X killed their wife", but it's really blood difficult to write genuine not-that-smart people.

    Edit: a smaller secondary problem is that by complaining about this I sound like an elitist arsehole.

    Figuring out which less-optimal-solution accurately would come from considering dumb-person traits like having a smaller working memory.

    What solution would you come up with if you only knew about [the number of facts you needed for the optimal solution] - 1? - 2? This simulates not being able to hold all of the information in your working memory. 

    What solution would you come up with if you were limited in the number of causative steps to complete it? Smaller working memory means you can't conceive of as many steps in the solution unless you can abstract them.

  Re [the other article](https://medium.com/@MrGrahamMoore/how-to-write-about-characters-who-are-smarter-than-you-c7c956944847#.7lrughxhg) ... I really don't like Holmes, because ["the trick"](http://www.sherlockian.net/acd/thetrick.html) didn't work on me. It's not Conan-Doyle's fault. It's the passage of time. Holmes' brilliant deductions, in the late 1800s and early 1900s, are based on the casual knowledge of a well read popular fiction writer of the late 1800s and early 1900s. From the point of view of a well-read scholboy in the late '60s and early '70s, the gaps in Holmes' knowledge were jarring.

  From the article:
  >The best way, the absolute best way, to get me to stop reading a book once I start is to have your characters consistently act inconsistently with their imputed intelligence. (Either way, although smart people doing dumb things offends me more than dumb people doing smart things.)

  >...

  >...consider the many [reality TV] shows in which people are chasing Bigfoot or aliens or whatever. Many of them are *reasonably* intelligent, if not well educated. They can work their ghost detectors and Bigfoot traps, no problem. Most of the things they do are not inherently illogical. But their basic *premise* is so messed up that they can’t help but do really, really dumb things (including accepting data and advice from people who are obviously crazy) on a regular basis. Fictionally, they’d probably be interesting characters.

  One thing that writers can do to is to hide information from their characters. So long as you can consistently keep track of what each character doesn't know, but the author and sometimes the reader does, this works.

  So long as you're not writing a straight detective/puzzle story, of course. 

  Though you have to make sure that the character really doesn't know about it. One of the things that gets me screaming at characters is having them *forget* things that have been established as common knowledge for plot-related reasons, and then "remember" them (or "discover" them) later on. If everyone knows about Chekhov's Gun, then having them look for a "missing weapon" instead is really annoying.
