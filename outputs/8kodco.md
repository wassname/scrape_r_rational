    > it's just a story about a guy learning about and playing around with a computer program-like magic system without much of a plot. Still surprisingly good with a very slow updating rate. About one chapter every 4 to 6 months, but it just updated last week which is why I'm posting about it here.

    In that thread someone requested that new chapters be posted on the subreddit, so here it is.
