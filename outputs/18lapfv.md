## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Throwing out a couple fictions I have enjoyed recently. Would love to hear any well written recs you have on basically any setting. I particularly enjoy fiction where the characters has impact on the world around them through tech/organizational methods rather than through personal power. 

  Spiraspira recently updated [Skitterdoc 2077 | Spacebattles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/skitterdoc-2077-worm-cyberpunk-2077-crossover.1052653/) which is a great worm/cyberpunk 2077 crossover. Taylor has nerfed biotinker powers and does some very interesting things in the cyberpunk setting. Highly recommend along with their other works! Updating 

  I also recently read through [Super Supportive | Royalroad](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63759/super-supportive/chapter/1096481/one-the-boy-in-the-bubble) after seeing it frequently recommended on these threads. I had been put off by the first two chapters previously but is well worth pushing through. Was thrilling and well written. There is a lot about the underlying mechanics of the magic system that has not yet been revealed to the readers but so far it is self consistent. The large cast of characters around the protagonist are interesting and promise more development in the future. Looking forward to further updates!


  [Sanitize | FanFiction](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize) is a great slice of life/satisfying tech development fiction focused on an OC with medical knowledge in the warring clans period of Naruto. Mostly focused on the growth of the medical center and surrounding town. Has interesting butterfly effect on the major players in the land of fire. Definitely a different type of Naruto fiction but highly enjoyable. Slow updates 

  [Hear the silence | AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896) follows the inheritor of a poison bloodline. Focuses on character development and world building. Very long and well written. Updating

  [Birds of a feather | AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890) Hermione Granger is a contemporary of Tom Riddle in the 1930-1940s. Meeting a muggleborn worthy of respect prior to starting Hogwarts completely changes perspective. Very well written and explores an unusual path for the genre. Still updating 

  [Worth the Candle | AO3](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249) is very good, often recommend on this site. An original fiction set in a algamagon of tabletop settings that the protagonist ran/homebrewed. Has a leveling system and explores the world and characters. Complete

    Seconding *Skitterdoc 2077* and *Sanitize*. Spiraspira (Skitterdoc 2077 author) has also been writing the excellent *[Cultivating Magic](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/cultivating-magic.1118890/)* during their hiatus from Skitterdoc, but was excited to see Skitterdoc update the other day!

    I also haven't been able to get through the first few chapters of *Super Supportive*. Maybe I'll give it one more try.
    ```

      *Cultivating Magic* is great fun. 

      I really liked how the author was like, "How can I make Hell more terrible?" and decided to not only privatize it, but also make it into an MLM. Top tier, A+: had me in stitches.

    I now also want the other side of that crossover, where the original Taylor from Cyberpunk 2077 (actually year 2062) wakes up in Brockton Bay. I suspect that even without powers, she'll be doing some ass-kicking.

  I've been binging [The Path Unending](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-path-unending-a-cultivation-quest.62599/) for the past week, and I sort of highly recommend it. It's about Kong Zhi, a city boy from a crafter family who goes into a sect. It kinda feels like reading those magic school stories, except this time in a cultivation setting. Kong Zhi meets people, befriends some, becomes rivals with others, gets put into difficult assignments by his seniors, has adventures, etc. It's a lot of fun, the characters have a lot of heart, and the action and crafting gets good. It's not really rational, but I really like the setting and characters. The worldbuilding is infrequent but provides depth to the story. I like the fact that most people are reasonable, but the world still has its own share of horrible things. It feels lived in. 

  Now the cons, sort of:

  * It's a quest written in 2nd person. 
  * It has a pretty slow pace. This was a positive for me when the protagonist takes time to build bonds with other characters. A solid amount of slice of life. Though sometimes it gets a bit too much.
  * The players make a terrible decision early on, deciding to betray a friend for a shiny. A lot of people seem to stop reading there. It gets resolved later on to a satisfactory degree, and the protagonist does mend bridges again. 
  * I think the density of the protagonist in social situation gets played up a bit much at times, though I guess it's typical for teenagers, and it's usually for comedic effect. 

  Anyways, strong-ish rec for me. It really worked for me, but my tastes are different from the norm here.
  ```

  - u/CatInAPot:
    ```
    I'm not de-reccing the story, but as someone who *did* stop at the "terrible decision", it really is detestable. Not only is it an awful move from the MC, the response from the friends he betrays fail to line up with their established characters. 

    I personally lost faith in the author's ability to create satisfying options for votes, and it colored my view of the MC to such a degree that I wasn't interested in seeing him succeed anymore.

    People who have read more of the story however, have consistently praised it after getting over the hump, and I enjoyed much of the story before that point, just telling any potential readers to be prepared for the story to have a rather abrupt end if you are not the type to forgive a very questionable writing blip.
    ```

    - u/ReproachfulWombat:
      ```
      It was the exact opposite for me. 

      People are not perfect, and I was almost ready to drop the story due to all the voters trying to 'optimise' every vote (badly) at the expense of characterisation and plot. Eventually there were consequences, and the voters Did Not Like That.

      TLDR: The voters voted to >!betray a burgeoning friendship for profit and influence in complete defiance of the protagonist's character up until that point. The friendship was ruined, obviously.!< The author made an incredible effort to salvage things so that the protagonist remained a coherent character afterwards, without minimising the consequences of 'his' choices. The impressive part is that he *succeeded*, and even managed to eventually >!repair that relationship!< in a way that was organic, painful, and incredibly sweet all at the same time (though it took most of a novel of character building and development to reach that point). 

      That whole section is what sold me on the author. Salvaging stupid votes (which are inevitable in quests) and turning them into a compelling story is a *skill*.

      Afterwards, the voters calmed down a lot and actually began to make an effort to priortise things that weren't necessarily 'optimal', but made for a much better story. The culture of the thread improved *massively*.

      10/10 handling of the situation in my view.
      ```

      - u/CatInAPot:
        ```
        I absolutely agree that people are not perfect, and I am down totally down for votes that go poorly or backfire. This isn't about optimization, this is about character derailment (big reason why I'm not huge on voting style stories in the first place).

        One of my problems with the "incident" is actually that it *didn't backfire enough.* >!Memory is a little fuzzy at this point, but the fact that two individuals, one who supposedly treasures loyalty, and one who volunteered in the first place out of a sense of justice, treat the MC with anything less than contempt after his incredibly selfish decision means three characters were ruined for me at once.!<

        >in complete defiance of the protagonist's character

        You actually acknowledge this primary issue yourself. The author is the one who created the option, and he did not have a way to write the voting result in such a way that it fits with the established character.  

        I see this often where people blame the voters for making stupid votes, forgetting that it's the author's failing to even have an option that makes zero sense for an established character in the first place.
        ```

        - u/ReproachfulWombat:
          ```
          I think we'll have to agree to disagree then. There were both good and bad choices available in that vote, and I'm of the opinion that the author was capable of writing any of them competently.  As you yourself noted, the story apparently *improved* afterwards. The readers just chose poorly, so bad things happened. The protagonist's actions were OOC, yes, but the Author interpreted that as Kong failing to think the consequences of his actions through, and doing something uncharacteristically cruel as a result. Valid, I think, and a perfect explanation for an 'out of character' voting option. Sometimes people make mistakes.

          Yes, it was hurtful, but it was also within the context of a >!schoolyard squabble!<.  It was a poor decision that shattered a friendship, and he regretted it from pretty much the moment he made it, but that's all it was. His friends were disappointed in him and a some became more distant, which made sense to me. People make stupid, selfish decisions sometimes, and for worse reasons than 'My family has asked me to do this' in a setting where filial piety is sacrosanct. I honestly think it was good writing, and a good way for the author to draw attention to the poor decisionmaking of the readers without sacrificing narrative cohesion.

          I think the story is stronger because of 'the incident', not weaker, but I'm sorry that it ruined things for you.
          ```

          - u/CatInAPot:

            Author writes something that is "In complete defiance of the protagonist's character up until that point."

            >I'm of the opinion that the author was capable of writing any of them competently.

            I suppose I just don't view a character doing something completely out of character for no good in-story reason as competent writing.

            >I don't think Kong deserved to become a Pariah for a single stupid decision.

            >!If a new friend of mine was responsible for making a different friend who was getting sexually harassed apologize to her sexual harasser without any cause beyond pride/greed, I would *absolutely* consider that shun-worthy.!<

            While I'm happy that the story remains enjoyable for you beyond that point, I heavily disagree that character assassination was a good way to reach that result. Regardless, good night.

    *Worth the Candle* is my favorite 1M+ work by far. I've never finished *The Wandering Inn*, but it's quite good and I can easily imagine myself getting lost in it some other time.

    By the way, HPMoR is only 660k words if you don't count SD and OoM. *Mother of Learning* is also only ~750k.

  There's a webtoon called Hand Jumper[Hand Jumper](https://m.webtoons.com/en/thriller/hand-jumper/list?title_no=2702&webtoon-platform-redirect=true) that has superpower tactics and  a very compelling story. Highly recommend.

      ```
      I thought so at first too! The reveal is pretty cool, so I would avoid looking at the following spoiler if you can, >!but their actual power is "rewinding time by a few seconds" and while that sounds boring,!< the way the main character uses this power is something this thread would enjoy.
      ```

      - u/Kuratius:
        ```
        I was aware of that when I wrote this comment. I still think that's just another manifestation of that power.
        I do wonder if teal powers are all like that and most users just psychologically lock themselves into a particular form.

        For that matter, maybe all blue powers are also equivalent, just with psychological differences changing how they manifest.


        The story itself is just typical Korean tropes mixed with superpowers from unordinary, I didn't feel that impressed by it. It stretches my suspension of disbelief a bit to see these social structures exist. It feels like a generic magic high school story.
        Incidentally, the guy who died the first time she activated her power didn't actually lose the bet about his rescuer, at least in a loose sense.

  I've recently started checking out stories that seem long from Latest Updates on Royal Road, and honestly had more success than I get from Rising Stars or Best Rated. I've also noticed that I really like some stories that a lot of people criticize as too edgy, like [The Systemic Lands](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57018/the-systemic-lands-dark-progressive-litrpg) and [Zeroth Moment](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/70672/zeroth-moment-my-cheat-skill-is-stupid-so-ill).

  Recommend me some stuff that is on the dark/edgy side, even if it crosses the line into cringe in your opinion I feel like I have a good chance of liking it.
  ```

  - u/CatInAPot:
    ```
    I quite enjoy [Godclads](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59663/godclads-eldritch-cyberpunk-progression), which has a blood-bending ghoul as an MC in a city that runs on death. 

    [Mythic Cultivation: My Tongtian can't be this Cute](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/61828/mythic-cultivation-my-tongtian-cant-be-this-cute) has a story that I somehow find very interesting, despite the fact that for the most part basically every single character is a selfish, power hungry, stereotypical cultivator.

    Have to catch up as it's been awhile, but I remember enjoying what I read of [Necroepilogos](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59967/necroepilogos), the setting being a "post-post-post-post-apocalypse" where the characters essentially have no option but cannibalism.
    ```

  - u/LaziIy:
    ```
    You could try Mistervii's other fictions, calculating cultivation is a pretty math blackhole/spreadsheet heavy and I'm not sure about the murder mittens one but his fans seem to like it.  

    Dark/Edgy reads that are borderline cringe would be [Hell Difficulty Tutorial](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/64916/hell-difficulty-tutorial) MC gives michael vibes but is much less murderhobo than him. The dipping into gruesome territory recommendation would be [What we do to survive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51307/what-we-do-to-survive) which is dark, but the setting of the plot demands it.
    ```

- u/FlameDragonSlayer:
  ```
  I recently just caught up to [When Immortal Ascension Fails Time Travel to Try Again](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36597/when-immortal-ascension-fails-time-travel-to-try) . It is a very well written Xianxia story with female MC who transmigrated into a Xianxia world from a novel(which she hadn’t read), cultivates for a thousand years and when almost ascending to immortality she fails her tribulation and gets sent back in time to when she first transmigrated. I find the world building very well done. I also really like the sect and the dynamics of the sect as a righteous sect. There isn’t much of the typical Xianxia MC shenanigans like face slapping and young masters and basically we get to explore the world from a more mature perspective. I also liked the sect that the MC joins. The story has an element of humor and the world and character mostly act rational I would say. 

  I am also looking for some recommendations for preferably completed stories or those with a sizable backlog of chapter will also do. I’m interested in sort of empire building, faction building, sect building type of stories, should be fantasy or Xianxia , I don’t really like sci-fi. Besides, I would also read tamer related stories or magic school related ones. 

  I haven’t read a lot of English fictions recently but I would welcome any type of recommendations, translated or otherwise.
