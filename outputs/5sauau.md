## [RT] [HF] [FF] [PGtE] Good, Evil and Shatranj

### Post:

This is a piece of fanfiction based upon [Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/2015/03/25/prologue/). Original webserial wasn't written by me, and this is by no means part of the official canon.

----

Good was sitting at a table.

Well, not quite. It wasn't really a table. And he wasn't really sitting. And he wasn't really "he". And the "was" part was closer to "was/is/will be/never stopped", but what can you do - English wasn't designed to describe what cosmic manifestations of metaphysical concepts mortals call "Gods" did with their time.

In front of him, Evil sat, reading a pretty thick rulebook Good wrote just a couple days before. He already went through it three times, and Good was getting pretty impatient.

"How many more times do you need to read that before you give up? That ruleset is flawless. Just admit you lost the bet and let's get this over with."

Evil gave a non-committal "Mhmm" and kept reading. He really could be quite infuriating at times.

"I am telling you, there are no loopholes there."

"Hmmhm"

"Well, if you want to waste more of your time, suit yourself."

"Mm"-said Evil, finally putting the book down. -"Deal the cards already. Let's play."

----

"Really? Triumphant? That's your endgame?"

"Mmmmm"

"Come on, flying fortresses are good, but they won't give you total world domination. She'll get overthrown in less than a decade."

"Hmmh. Are you going to throw the dice or what?"

"Yeah, yeah, sure."

----

"Huh, my crusade got turned away."

"Mm"

"But Terribilis'll still die eventually. What are you playing at here?"

"Absolutely nothing. As a matter of fact, nothing on this side of the board, or in Praes in general is in any way relevant. My true endgame has always been situated right in the middle of Callow."

"Yeah, as if I'd buy that, Mr So-Totally-Not-Lying. We'll see."

----

Good moved his Prince forwards, finishing his battle preparations, and threw the moving stick back to Evil, transferring the turn.

"My army is larger. You know what this means, right? Fields of Streges will be covered in orc blood by tomorrow."

Evil smirked, stood up, and cracked his knuckles.

"Well, let's see about that."

And then he started his turn.

----

Good stared at the board. He blinked, hoping this bad dream would go away. It didn't. 

"What the hell just happened?"

Evil raised an eyebrow. 

"If you want me to go over the last turns in detail, I can certainly do that." 

Good sighed.

"Rub it in, will you. Whatever, I can still salvage this, let me just get my Prince into position..."

"What Prince? You don't have a Prince."

"Yeah, right. He is right he-..."

"..."

"...where the hell is my Prince?"

"You *had* a Prince, until four moves ago, when he got his throat cut. By a lowly goblin, I think."

"..."

"I am screwed, aren't I."

"Yep. Callow will fall today."

"You know it will rise soon enough. Triumphant tried that, and look how it worked out."

"Mmmm. Do your turn already."

----

Evil wasn't smiling. That would be telling. However, he was quite delighted how events were unraveling according to his predictions.

His ability to directly affect the world was very limited, unlike that of Good. He wasn't able to summon beings of pure Evil into the world, or spawn his agents like Good spawned Heroes, or to even directly communicate and order pawns around. That has been the point of the game, after all-to see if humans without help would be able to break Fate while Good tried his best to counter their efforts. At best he could subtly influence someone important from time to time - there would be no posessing a Villain for him at a crucial moment. Not that he needed it.

Push a stone off a hill, and it will roll. Close your eyes, and you still know it will roll in that same direction, bouncing off roots and hubbles, until it stops at the bottom. If you know the shape of the hill, you can guess where the stone will end up without looking at it, and can control that location when you first push it downhill. And then there is no reason to adjust it after that first push. Pawns were taken by Rooks, stones pushed on stones, humans talked to other humans. Affect one crucial part of the system, and you affect the whole system a hundred turns from now. And all it takes is one little push.

Put a thought in the mind of a young sorceress, and she'll set off on a path to conquer the continent. Arrange for one young man to learn the tale of that sorceress and learn from her mistakes, and you will get a masterful tactitian a hundred turns from then. Pull here, shove there, a dozen others to mask the real moves, and the whole board moves where you need it. Villain gets born. He assembles a ragtag bunch of misfits. Those misfits do the impossible, setting up the board for still later moves.

Evil didn't smile. It was time to start his real endgame, for which he was setting everything up the whole time. It was quite simple in design, actually, but some things had to go *just right* for it to even start. You see, when Good wrote the rulebook, he didn't capitalise "Hero" in "hero's journey". And lowercase "hero"? My, that wasn't defined anywhere in the book, and thus was very much open for *interpretation*. Something Evil was *quite* good at.
