  Hmm, I feel like Cat is forming her own Calamities.

  Black | Cat

  Warlock | Apprentice

  Captain | Adjutant

  Assassin | Iunno, Robber maybe? He seems to be enough of a legend amongst Goblins to get a name.

  Ranger | Here I have no clue. Maybe Archer takes a liking to her?

  Edit: Hell, she even has her own Grem One-Eye in the form of Juniper.

    Yep, that seems to have been building up for a while. I like your idea that Archer might take Ranger's place. Additionally, for your consideration, I give you:
    Scribe | Ratface

    There's still such a huge power gap between the old team and the new.

      Just thinking about parallels - if Scribe is Ratface (which fits!), then Aisha might be the Empress equivalent? 

      It appears that the "groups" would work in odd numbers, i.e. 3 | 5 | 7 and the history mirrors the present.

      For example, in Appellant, there was a core group of three calamities attacking the heroes: Black, Warlock, Captain. There was a hidden fourth (not part of the main action): Assassin. 

      In Chapter 7 (Elaboration), there was a core group of three: Cat, Apprentice, Adjutant. The hidden fourth was Archer.

      For the calamities in general, it seems to have a core of 7 Named:

      1. Empress (behind the scenes)
      2. Black
      3. Warlock
      4. Captain
      5. Assassin (?)
      6. Ranger (retired)
      7. Scribe (affiliated)

      For the mirroring effect, I guess Cat would end up with 7 Named too.
      ```

        Major problem with Aisha being the Empress here is that Cat isn't going to compromise like Black did in his personal rebellion. I suspect she's going to end up Queen or Tyrant of both countries.

        I can't imagine her hearing the song means anything different.

  YAY COULDNT WAIT 
  also I love you and this is one of the best stories I've ever read. Now excuse me while I go read
  (now that I wrote this comment I fear that in this chapter you'll have killed someone and I'll hate you lol)

    As much as I'd love to be able to write this cleverly, I am not the author. I just post new chapters here so more people get to enjoy one of my very favourite web fics. I don't think the author uses reddit much (if at all).

      I post to answer questions now and then, but not much besides that.

      ErraticEratta has posted here before.  So it's at least non-zero usage.
