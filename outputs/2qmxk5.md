  Anyone know some good resources for training this type of critical thinking?

    you could try look through [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2qm34x/serious_whats_the_most_useful_course_i_can_take/), it might have some useful resources.

    [Think101x](https://www.youtube.com/user/xTHINK101/videos) is a good MOOC from University of Queensland, the videos are up on youtube.

    If you have done previous rationality stuff it could be a bit basic, but there are lots of interviews with really big names in the rationality game. Daniel Kahneman talks about type 1 and type 2 thinking, for example.

    Most of the questions related to concepts from the statistics classes I took in college, so I'd recommend learning some general statistics and reading how scientists test their hypothesizes through falsification and similar tests.

    I apologize that I don't have any handy links to material for you to read up on, but I picked up most of the concepts in the article by applying my college education to the research papers I'm required to read.

    I don't know how effective it is, but there's an app called the [Credence Calibration game](http://rationality.org/calibration/) that's built to train one aspect of rationality. As far as I know, there aren't yet broader programs for developing all of these skills.

    The same site has a section with [book recommendations](http://rationality.org/reading/). You may find some of them helpful.
