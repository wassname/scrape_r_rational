  I'm familiar with The Reckoning, The Rickoning had bettered be a Rick and Morty crossover!

  Edit: ok! Regretting it! How do I undo this?

    What are you complaining about? Can't you just portal-jump to a universe where Brain Bleach is real and use some?

    Then portal-jump to a universe identical to this one expect for where this story was never written to avoid repeating the same mistake.

      No, I hear the portal juice formula will kill you if you fuck it up. Might be easier to hide the post then a limited mind wipe, then destroy the receptacle.

      ... I did have that interlude I wanted to write that would have been formatted like a UN article interleaved with various snippets from the perspective of various Brazilian controllers... but I really, really don't have the time to write it down... but I really, really want to write it... aaargh.

        I didn't have time to write this until now, my holiday break.

        (Also. CouteauBleu. As an Animorphs fan yourself, what is your honest opinion on this, this, this *thing* that I have written. Basically I want to know if I should tag TK17 or hide away in shame and never return)

          If he's anything like me, he'll be ecstatic that someone wrote a fanfic based on his story. Writers and artists ***love it*** when other people start creating derivative works.

          Hold your head up in pride!

              I donâ€™t have time to look at this right this second, but based on the comment thread, I am flattered and excited. Note that the character of V3 came from a fanfic after the first four chapters.

  I haven't gotten around to watching the Rick and Morty show and this utterly glorious *wreck* of **absurdity** has convinced me to watch it.

  All I want to know is, is there anything in this story that doesn't hold for the show itself? Basically what part was fanon instead of canon?
  ```

  - u/LieGroupE8:
    ```
    * The structure of chapter 1 is directly modeled after a Rick and Morty episode, but the events differ of course.
    * The last little scene before the credits is essentially taken directly from the show
    * Portals in the show can do essentially arbitrary things, but all the weird physics is post hoc rationalization by me.
    * Morties are treated similarly in the show with respect to Ricks, although there is none of the "Rick-Morty bond" stuff. There is an episode where a particularly evil Rick uses a ton of Morties as a shield against being located.
    * Unity is a real character in Rick and Morty who has dated Rick, though she is not portrayed as an Eldritch god.
    * The general tentacly weirdness is present throughout the show.
    * The show has songs of comparable weirdness. Look up "Terryfold" on youtube. Edit: Oh yeah, and Get Schwifty is just directly from an episode.

    Edit 2: Oh yeah, and Rick is still a genius alcoholic nihilist in the show, and also Tiny Rick is from the show. (If you thought Tiny Rick was weird, there is an episode where Rick literally just turns himself into a pickle and goes around doing stuff as a pickle)
    ```

- u/LieGroupE8:
  ```
  Setting the insanity aside for just a second, I'd like the following feedback:

  * How was the writing on technical level?
  * How did I do on the character perspectives? Did I stay true to the characters?

  I am not a writer by trade and this was a creative writing exercise for me.

    This coming from the guy who wrote [FW: Admin Message from God](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7obnf7/fw_admin_message_from_god/), [a Netflix series about us](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/5v5f4i/i_feel_like_theres_a_lot_of_potential_for_a/), and the [article comparing flight to AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/7shgd2/if_the_media_in_the_19th_century_talked_about/).

    I only wish I could think of writing the things you do.

    Anyway, enough of the praise. Onto the helpful criticism.

    You definitely have talent and from what I can tell, you are good at writing about absurd situations and finding humor in people reactions.  You are also good at allowing your characters to behave and react appropriately to the event instead of becoming morons for the sake of the joke like we often see in sitcoms. Basically your settings are absurd, but your characters are not (which is why I like what you write so much). Other than Rick, but he's more of a plot device than a character anyway...

    From what I can tell, this is your strength and weakness. You write very well when things are still shocking and new to your characters, but once your characters have adapted to the situation, things end very shortly after. Once Rick and Morty had a handle on things the story ended very quickly in chapter 3. I was actually expecting some sort of scene of Rick and Morty relaxing after their adventure, but we only saw their reactions and then the credits rolled.

    That was fine for this short story since it seems to be very similar to how a Rick and Morty episode plays out (from the one episode I've seen so far anyway). This advice is only if you want tips on how to write a longer lasting story in the future and isn't really meant for *Animorphs: The Rickoning*. When your characters have been through a major event, give them downtime. Stories need peak and low moments. The peaks are dramatic moments that we love to read such as fight scenes, mystery reveals, and cliffhangers. While the lows are the moments in between where characters develop relationships between each other, spend time pursuing a favored hobby, and having regular slice-of-life events that teach the reader what their personalities are like.

    Don't really know if this is helpful since it's not stuff about what you posted (it was perfect and I couldn't think of a single thing to improve), but I hope it's useful for when you might want to write longer stories.

    Well, I'm not a real writer either, but here's some feedback:

    > Morty: Rick? Can you please pre-target the portal gun to the blender dimension?

    That's not really something I'd expect to hear from Rick and Morty. It's way too technical and specific. Like, in the episode where it's introduced, the joke about the "Blender dimension" is that it's something that sounds ridiculous and incredibly specific and unusual, and yet the characters act like it was an established part of their everyday life. "Portal gun to the Blender dimension? That's the oldest Rick trick in the book!"

    It's not a joke you can repeat a second time, by definition. A better joke would be something like:

    **Morty:** Rick? What's the baddest, darkest, most terrifying dimension you have? Like, like, if you really want to get rid or something, like, like throw it into the sun except worse? I mean-

    **Rick:** Oh, I've got a ton of those. There's the blender dimension, the black hole dimension, the dimension where everyone looks like Hitler, the carnivorous planets dimension, the tentacle monster dimension, there's, there's, like, a ton of those, Morty! I mean, forget that last one, you're probably a little too young for that last one, but any other dimension, sure, there's a ton of them!

    **Morty:** Okay, then, just set the portal gun to one of these things you just mentioned.

    **Rick:** Why?

    *Morty portals David*

    > The Animorphs morph into birds and fly above the treeline, making sure to watch out for any predatory Pterodactyls in the vicinity. They find a ledge on a high rock formation and alight. A few minutes later, they've all morphed into Morty. A few minutes after that, most have demorphed in abject horror. Garrett starts vomiting. Rachel morphs into a bear and destroys a nearby shrub. Jake and Marco remain in Morty-morph, absorbing every detail. Finally, they demorph. Tobias is the first to speak.

    That paragraph represents why I don't like crackfics, cross-overs, SI fics and basically every other weird-but-codified fanfiction concept.

    In any dramatic story, that reveal would either be the big climax that the story built up to (everything you knew was a lie!), or a part of the premise that the characters spent the whole story diggesting. In r!Animorphs, for instance, both Visser 3 and the gang spend entire chapters doing nothing but considering past revelations (humans getting the morph cube, the fact that the war is manipulated by omnipotent gods, etc) and thinking through their implications.

    In crackfic, it's just something to get out of the way in one paragraph so we can go fight dinosaurs. The revelation barely has any weight because everyone just acts shocked for ten seconds, then just rolls with it for the rest of the story. I don't really want to say it's *bad* writing (but it totally is); in any case, it's really not for me, and this is essentially the point where I quit.

    (this is also why I've stopped reading *With this Ring*, and why *Worth the Candle* is the only SI story I still read)

      > That's not really something I'd expect to hear from Rick and Morty. It's way too technical and specific. 

      Agree. These versions of Rick and Morty have somewhat diverged from the show stylistically, for a variety of reasons. In the particular part you quote, sounding technical and specific was exactly what I wanted to go for.

      > In any dramatic story, that reveal would either be the big climax that the story built up to (everything you knew was a lie!), or a part of the premise that the characters spent the whole story digesting.  ....  
      >  
      > In crackfic, it's just something to get out of the way in one paragraph so we can go fight dinosaurs. 

      Yup, totally agree. If I approached this as a regular story I would never have skipped over that part so quickly. (Also, it would be 20 chapters long, I'd still be writing it next year, and I'd have gone insane by chapter 10.)

      > this is essentially the point where I quit 

      Totally get it - this style fic most definitely isn't for everyone. However, I do think that in chapter 2 I actually addressed your criticisms within the limits of what is possible for a short frenetic crackfic. Styled fully as a series of short r!Animorphs chapters, the thematic point was to show realistic character psychologies when confronted with the absurd. I mean, Esplin gets 3 POVs in that chapter and Marco gets 2, all of which are extremely reflective as compared to ch. 1, and I could have written much more but I had to stop myself.

        Best complement ever, thank you! Especially coming from the author of my favorite rationalfic since HPMOR. Besides the short "stories" that I've previously posted in /r/rational (see my post history or [xamueljone's comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aalr3e/c_animorphs_the_rickoning/ectxs84) above), I don't really have original fiction posted anywhere, but I may start in the future. Writing is *time-consuming* though.
