## [D] Literary fiction can't be this depressing!

### Post:

> (And as long as I’m on the subject: ‘literary’ stories about broken people becoming even more broken are not fun to read on grounds of pure hedonics.  If you try to countersignal that your story must be very hip and contrarian because it offers so little merely pleasurable reward for reading it, don’t expect to sucker anyone self-aware enough to have moved on past meta-contrarianism.)

-Some guy

So I'm in this writing workshop, and it sucks because everyone sucks at writing and they're not recognizing my genius, but I've noticed this pattern. There are basically two kinds of stories being written: 

a) genre stories, primarily by male writers, about people in a crummy situation solving their problems.

b) literary stories, about a 50/50 gender split, that are about depressing, miserable people in depressing, miserable situations who become more depressed and miserable by the end of the story.

c) romance stories, these don't count.

And this pretty much mirrors my experience as a reader. Genre stories heavily feature problem-solving as the appeal, literary stories heavily feature watching things fall to shit as the appeal.

Now, subjective tastes are subjective, but one thing I really value out of stories, and I expect is true for many of you, is characters who can serve as role models. Eliezer has some quote about having learned morality from Thundercats, I don't remember where.

It's true for me as well. My morality, intellectual skills, and heroic qualities, such as they are, are heavily drawn from books I read. I did decent things as a kid in large part because the cool characters in my books did decent things. I learned how to think because detective, science fiction, and some fantasy writers taught me how. Pretty much every brave thing I've ever done was inspired in part by the knowledge that it's what my favorite book characters would have done. At least, my favorite genre book characters.

I read a lot of literary stuff too. It just doesn't really inspire me the same way. Shakespeare is the shit as a writer, but it's not like I really want to model myself after Hamlet. Stuff like *Huckleberry Finn* taught me powerful lessons, but "be like Huck" was never quite something I thought about. 

And not all genre fiction teaches, at least not through role models. *Sandman* is cool as balls, but Dream is kind of a dumbass. (He's meant to be.)

It's not like genre stories can't tell us things about society and racism and whatever. So I don't see why literary fiction shouldn't be able to give us some people striving to solve their problems and succeeding in doing so instead of getting American Dreamed Into Drug-Addled Misery like 95% of them.

Why would this split exist? ~~Well, it's pretty clear that in the ancestral environment, men who could impress the tribe with an oral tale of wizards and dragons would get laid all the time~~

Maybe there is a lot of literary fiction with characters you can model yourself after and I'm just a fraud who's never read anything. Got any examples? Give them in the comments below and i'll pm u a pizza roll

If there are no examples, wtf is up with literary fiction? Why can't you write a story about a middle class guy who gets a hobby and reinvigorates his sex life instead of sinking into the morass of 20th century suburban ennui?

I don't know why this split would exist. Maybe it's because, when you're writing about a problem in our society that exists, you can't write a story about the average person in that situation who then succeeds in getting out of it, because the average person doesn't succeed in getting out of it. Whereas sci-fi and fantasy allow you to imagine a fictional world where just a normal everyman kind of guy can solve his problem, because the world is set up for that to actually be doable. So literary fiction would have to give us role models of exceptional people, making it hard to empathize, whereas genre fiction can give us normal people as role models, allowing readers to see and make the connection?

give ur thoughts in the comments

Also, in the comments: define your intellectual, moral, and heroic qualities in fictional character terms. For example, I'm basically Comic Book Guy plus Ben Stiller's character from *Dodgeball.*

  I really, really liked Scout, from *To Kill a Mockingbird*, but the exemplar is her father Atticus Finch, who has explicitly served as a role model for lawyers, to the point that the Alabama State Bar [made a monument to his name](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oOl_Fy2tuwY/U1m8p8_StTI/AAAAAAAAiTs/hC0r-P3uvA0/s1600/IMG_5418+-+Copy.JPG).

    Note that Atticus only became an exemplar because one editor insisted that Harper Lee write a quite different novel from [her initial plans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Set_a_Watchman).  I wonder, who primarily sets the Overton Window of literary fiction?  This's at least one data point against editors playing a primary role...

  Worm doesn't really have role models - that's part of what makes it such a good story. The characters do cool things, decent things, but not because they are role-model-level perfect.

  I don't want unrealistic characters or easy successes. In a tragedy, I want to be able to think it could have ended well - in the opposite, that it could have ended in failure.

  That said, there are virtuous/heroic characters in shakespeare too - Macbeth is ostensibly a tragedy, but the result is good for the kingdom, and the person who becomes king is somewhat shown to deserve the role.

    I thought Taylor was a determinator role model. . . Never give up no matter what, even if you go stark raving crazy, and all that sort of thing.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      Taylor is also a model of the struggle to work with and communicate with other people, even when it is difficult because of legitimate trust issues.  Remember that she wins in the end not only because of her raw determination, but because even as she went mad, she was still able to watch and follow Lisa's plan.

  - u/waylandertheslayer:
    ```
    I'd have to say that Worm inspired me a lot, but it wasn't any single character that did it. Rather, the traits that a lot of characters shared - strong convictions, the ability to see those convictions through - resonate with me, because I feel like I lack that.

  Stories with happy endings may be accused of being wish fulfillment.  Stories where everyone is miserable can't be.  So if you want to be taken seriously, write a story where everyone is miserable, because that provides one fewer club for the critics to beat you over the head with.

    I agree with this, with the addendum that I often end up liking the changes. The best example I've personally experienced is the MCU, which has generally toned down how goofy and weird the comics could be. I'm not a big fan of Jeph Loeb's comic since they tended to be gritty in ways I didn't enjoy, but he's done a great job produced Marvel's tv shows since he has so much experience grounding the silliness.

  It's a little rude completely dismissing romance stories like that, I think the mere fact that some people enjoy them is a strong justification for their existence. It's hard to write it well, but relationships are very important and deserve to be written about.

  I'm a mix between Pearl from Steven Universe and Pinkie Pie from MLP. I have a desperate cloying need for approval from others and fluctuate between shoving myself into the spotlight and hiding from everything, not to mention my laundry list of neuroses.

  DayStarEld pointed it out before in your other thread, but it bears reiterating: you have all the skills of a youtube star/personality.  Your titles are engaging, you grab attention, and you flow well from generally agreeable points to extremely in-your-face opinions delivered colloquially and in a surprisingly cogent fashion (another comment from the other thread).  You end it with a call to action for audience engagement.

  I'm not sure if you're doing it on purpose, but if you're not, what you wrote is basically the transcript of a youtube video.  You should make that video, make others like it regularly, and share your videos to fora/communities/blogs that would like your content.

  You seem to love sharing strongly held and well reasoned opinions.  People love to hear strongly held and well reasoned opinions shared in an engaging fashion.  Your apparent default means of mass communication is engaging and highly effective at grabbing and building an audience.

  Why not make a profit off that?

  I think the "why" of it is related to why it seems like artists in great pain make better art, but it's not like I have a great answer to that, either.

  There are a few authors that are genre, but on the more literary end of things:
  Most/all of Asimov and Zelazny. Louis McMaster Bujold (the stuff after her military SF).

  For individual books - these get way more "literary":
  Child of Fortune by Norman Spinrad, Dune*, Diaspora by Greg Egan, The Martian.

  * I don't know if this counts as "not depressing", but it's definitely a role model source for me. 

  I *want* to say Ursula Le Guin, but I honestly don't remember well enough. Still, check out "The Dispossed", not just Earthsea.

  China Mieville's "Embassy Town" finally managed to teach me what "literature" is (I can't explain the idea the story conveys without telling you story), but it's not what I'd call "feel-good".

  Maybe the problem is like that R!Lucius tells R!Draco about the play: If the writer was clever enough to solve the problem, they'd do it, instead of writing about it.


  As for myself in fictional terms - Ehhh maybe a cross between Twig's Sylvester, a Mentat, annnnnd the weird wise wanderer? Sometimes I think my life is half-fictional already, the shenanigans I get up to. 

  (I have a friend who really should be all the way fictional. Her idea of summer camp is an archeological dig at the great pyramids; her idea of poker is winning money from Richard Branson while transiting the bearing straight; her idea of a vacation is hitch hiking across Nicuragua solo, at 19. She gets it from her dad, who's similarly wtf).

    The thing about suffering is that it stress-tests one's ability to spin meaning out of life, which can sometimes lead one to abandon cliche philosophy and form a more reasoned and complete answer to the question "why do you live". I say "sometimes" because this is unlikely enough that breaking people does not create a net gain, but the outliers gain a hell of a lot of individuality in the process.

    Art is, in one way or another, an expression of one's worldview. Therefore, people with unusual worldviews tend to produce "originality" and "wisdom". (The scare quotes are because I subscribe to Yudkowsky's theory that wisdom is simply having a coherent and well-reasoned viewpoint that diverges from the conventional.) Both of these are likely contributing factors to whether any given art piece is considered "good".

    To put this syllogism together, suffering can create unusual worldviews, unusual worldviews are interpreted as "wisdom", and "wisdom" is probably one of the factors that leads to something being considered good art.

  Remember the discussions about how difficult it is to write a character smarter than you?  I posit that there is a corollary - it is difficult-to-impossible to write a character more efficacious than yourself, given the same constraints.  Genre writers get to play around with the constraints.  Even if they may be ineffective in their actual lives, "what if I had magic", or "what if I were on a spaceship" may trigger different thought patterns that allow them to punch above their normal weight class in regards to problem-solving creativity.  

  On the other hand, someone writing literary earthfic is constrained to realistic solutions for realistic problems.  If you struggle to maintain or improve satisfying relationships irl, you'll probably struggle to write a character who can accomplish the feat, in a way that seem realistic to readers.  To paraphrase EY, if the writer knew how to actually take over the world, they wouldn't be writing a story about world domination, they'd be sipping the drink of their choice from the caldera-heart of their Volcano Lair.  If the writer knew how to mend relationships, find career success and rightfully earn the admiration of worthy peers, they'd probably be doing that instead of putting in time at a writers workshop.  

  This is not to say that all people using writers workshops are failures, or anything.  But it seems likely that the people you're seeing there are more likely than average to be generally ineffective in the rest of their lives, which will naturally make it difficult for them to write characters who can do things they themselves *could* do, but probably struggle with.

  So, with that constraint on what you can actually write well about, I'd imagine many of those literary writers can *easily* imagine how to send the functional parts of their lives crashing down in flaming wreckage.  Every pessimistic fantasy in which your SO gets dramatically furious about something becomes a plot point.  All the things that existential terror suggests you *could* do, that you *wouldn't* do because you don't want to burn all bridges become easy sources of conflict to write about.  It may be depressing as hell, but it's at least more conceivable than the magical formula to success that you've never actually figured out.

    > Remember the discussions about how difficult it is to write a character smarter than you?

    But it's *not* hard to write a character at least somewhat smarter than you. As the author you can easily give your character two things you can't have in reality -- unlimited time to think things through and perfect deductive knowledge.

    You know when something happens unexpectedly, and you go over and over it later in your mind figuring out what the optimal response would have been? You can easily write a character that thinks faster than you do and can come up with those optimal reactions on the fly. In fact, almost all fictional characters do this to at least some extent -- that's how you have clean, sharp, witty, hard hitting dialog so much more often in books than in real life.

    Inhumanly perfect deductive knowledge is what Sherlock Holmes runs on. In real life drawing deductions from events and details is difficult and fraught with errors, alternate interpretations, and gaps in one's knowledge, generally producing a range of fuzzy possibilities. In fiction this is not a problem. As the author you have all the knowledge about the setting and characters, and can grant that knowledge to your characters at will. 

    Done poorly this results in insane yet correct Bat/Tattletale deductions, and taken to extremes you get an omniscient Sherlock Holmesien superintelligence who knows the reason behind the fall of every sparrow and the disposition of every grain of dust, but every author does it at least a little, as when they grant knowledge of one character's thoughts to another character and justify it with some line about seeing their expression or the way they move.

    In a way, the author's perfect knowledge of the fictional universe and of cause and effect in it is a form of superinteligence. I think one of the reasons superintelligent characters are rare is because the have the same problems as post foom AIs -- they are boring because they always know the path to victory in any situation, and so they will win no matter what. Essentially, a Mary Sue. To make it interesting you have to have an opposing superintelligence, and then write the conflict between them in a believable, interesting, and understandable to lesser intelligences (aka humans) way. And THAT's what's *really* difficult.

    As far as realism goes, you can easily apply heightened intelligence to reality or stories trying to be set in reality. For lower levels of enhanced intelligence, hard work and drive is functionally equivalent to intelligence. A character in a best approximation of reality who ignores fatigue and boredom to acquire skills or accomplish objectives is displaying a form of low level enhanced intelligence.

      I think the best example of this is Star Wars character Grand Admiral Thrawn. He never makes a reasoning you couldn't have come up with on your own, and for that reason it's not too hard to follow his thought processes, but he's just faster, more accurate, more attentive to details than the average person, which makes him feel like a great genius.

    If they understand the problem well enough to write it realistically, then they know what to change, in the problem, to make it possible for the protagonist to solve.

    The author may be constrained to have his protagonist as efficacious as he is (I'm not sure he *is*, but even if he is) but he is not required to make the world as challenging as it is. It merely needs to *seem* as challenging as it is.

  [Lazlo Zalezac](http://storiesonline.net/a/Lazlo_Zalezac) has written several Earthfic stories where normal everyman kinds of guys solve their problems, often reinvigorating their sex lives in the process; in particular, [Thunder and Lightening](http://storiesonline.net/s/43891/thunder-and-lightening) is a nearly ideal example thereof, and a story currently in progress, [The Future of Miss Powers](http://storiesonline.net/s/13830/the-future-of-miss-powers) may also provide interesting thoughts to fans of ratfic.. (He also does genre fics; I discovered him when looking for stories about John Carter of Mars, and found an entirely unexpected, but still quite enjoyable, set of stories about an entirely different character with that name.)

  It's possible that people sometimes, instead of wanting "that is the person I would be", rather want "I may be in a bad way, but at least I'm not in as much trouble as *that* guy".

  People look at Superman, or Sherlock Holmes, and say "I'll never be that good. I'm inadequate." Or they look at a story about some guy solving his problems, and they feel inadequate because they have not solved their problems.

  And then they turn to a story of a miserable guy getting steadily more miserable and say "At least I'm better off than *that* guy." And this leaves them feeling good about their situation, despite the problems they haven't solved.

  > ‘literary’ stories about broken people becoming even more broken are not fun to read

  I think there are ways to do this well. To switch mediums for a moment, I would describe both *BoJack Horseman* and *Jessica Jones* as stories about broken people becoming even more broken, and I loved them a lot.

  (If the claim is in some way specific to novels in particular, then examples are springing less to mind at the moment, but perhaps *The World According to Garp* would qualify, or the first *Magicians* novel before reading the sequels.)

  Yes, *Anna Karenina* and *Antigone* are miserable, but I don't think we can blame the entire concept of fiction about broken people become more broken for that.

  The way TV Tropes frames this argument on their page about how to write characters, is that characters are defined by their Virtues and Flaws. Virtues make us say "I want to be this character", while Flaws make us say "I am this character". Success is meant to inspire us to conquer our own obstacles, while failure is meant to create empathy for a situation we can relate to. That doesn't make me like them, though.

  I hate depressing stories and love heroism. I didn't even finish Worm because I couldn't take Armsmaster's dickishness, Leviathan, Taylor being set back to square one, the Slaughterhouse 9, the Protectorate screwing up, and a malicious conspiracy in rapid succession without any levity or successes beyond surviving. It was just so much that I was starting to see Taylor's determination as foolhardy instead of admirable.

  For what character I relate to, I was going to say Ender if he had a lot more internal obstacles to face, but the one I identify with the most is the protagonist of [this story](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3pyg3h/wp_a_day_before_the_earth_is_destroyed_by_a/).

  I write stories about people slowly breaking because I was subject to a significant amount of psychological trauma when I was very young and therefore have an inbuilt assumption that things by default get worse. I have been able to bend my built-in story trajectory upwards a _little_, with an immense amount of work.

  Also, part of the process of bending that trajectory upwards involves me actively continuing to write stories about people slowly breaking, just in fractionally less horrifying situations each time, and actively continuing to read stories about people slowly breaking, _also_ in situations that have become somewhat less terrible as my tastes have been able to expand upwards.

  If I did not think it was worth it to bend this trajectory upwards I would not be doing it.
