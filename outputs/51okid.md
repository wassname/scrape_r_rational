## [Challenge Companion] Moloch

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the challenge companion thread, post recommendations, ideas, commentary, etc. below.**

First, read [Meditations on Moloch](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/). It's long and wide-ranging, but I always imagined the central thrust to be that many of the problems within any large organization (such as society) are caused by individual agents which are self-interested to the detriment of that larger organization. There's a lot more in there about counterbalancing forces to Moloch and how it might be defeated once and for all, and of course there have been a number of reaction pieces written in response to the article.

Personally, when I think of Moloch I think of the large corporations that I once worked for. For a period of about seven years, I was a contract software engineer, and I got to see inside a lot of enormous corporations with tens of thousands of employees. Some people have a tendency to view corporations as sleek, efficient machines which exist solely to maximize profit, but my view of them was eventually that of enormous, lurching creations which flail about inefficiently *even with rigorous controls to keep them from doing that*. While the corporation itself might exist to increase share value, the individuals within the corporation are largely unconcerned with that; they care about their performance reviews, or not getting yelled at by their boss, or gaining status with their co-workers, or displaying dominance, or a hundred other things that at best only serve as loose proxies for increasing share value and at worst are actively detrimental to the survival of the company. (For what it's worth, the few government projects I worked on were much the same.)

The best teams that I ever worked on were incredibly small ones where everyone was focused on the task at hand, and focused on the task for its own sake - but you can't actually run companies like that.

  I have a different take on the *Meditations*--I saw Moloch as the inexorable pressure on individuals to give up incrementally more of their terminal goals in exchange for instrumental advantages--because, as much as we'd like it to be otherwise, defecting in a zero-sum game often is the rational, superrational, or otherwise advisable real-world move.

    This is my understanding also.  Even in the context of Moloch as the evil personification of coordination problems, there wouldn't be a coordination problem in the first place if not for the exchange of terminal values for instrumental values.  And because the exchange is even more difficult to reverse than to avoid in the first place, I'm reminded of the line from James Lowell via Unsong:

    "They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin."

    [edit: line is from James Lowell, not William Blake.]

        Right you are.  Thanks for the correction.

  Firstly, that article for sure deserves its own post. First time I've seen it on this subreddit and I [searched for Moloch](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=moloch&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) without seeing a previous post.  Since it doesn't I do want to comment somewhat on it.

  Secondly, and I can't figure out how to comment on the article and it's going to bug my if I don't say it anywhere, the article spells Britain as Britan.

  Thirdly the conclusion of the article seems to be to fight Moloch you need a) in a world where singularities do exist and happen to create one that perfectly fits "Elua" or b) switch back to absolute monarchies with random citizen inherit rules such that random chance will hopefully stop us ending in the sea (which all other routes seem to lead).

  Fourthly, behavioural economics (and all of micro economics really), this subreddit really needs to read into it. So much stuff from the nonsense balisisk (incredible threat) mentioned in this post to basically the entire rest of the content, be it the free rider or tragedy of the commons. 

  Fifthly, I'm very curious as to how people will actually write a prompt for this as a description of human history (imagined into the future) sure sounds like it would be apt. While you mention that your company experience is the prime example now that I know the name for this Pareto inefficiency it seems like Moloch is everywhere and that knowledge is nigh useless in relevancy. 

  Sixthly, kind of weird in the article that they named names and seemed to expect the reader to be aware of who they were. As well as including tweets and similar things, kind of struck me as odd. Perhaps the article could be made more clean, more readily shareable if the author had paraphrased or entirely built up the other viewpoints without specifying people. Maybe that's just my preference though.

    Despite the fact that Moloch is one of his most popular articles, I'm not sure that Scott Alexander intended for it to be the first SSC article that you share with someone. At least to myself, it feels like part of a dialogue (which feeling might be heightened by knowing that there are other posts out there that were written explicitly in response to Moloch). 

    Certainly, most if not all of his audience would be familiar with e.g. Nick Land to some degree, and I wouldn't be surprised if Scott had been writing for his present audience first and for a hypothetical unfamiliar-with-his-works audience second.

      Yes I would agree that the article felt like I should have been familiar with those names mentioned

    Does anyone like his conclusions?

      Disliking it is not the same as thinking it false.  Myself, I don't like it, but I strongly suspect it's true.

      Well I don't really like either of those options. With singularities you have to rush to make the first one otherwise you rely on someone else, but rushing makes yours less likely to be perfect. 

      For the monarchy I actually like the idea of Saudi Arabia. From a western point of view they seem pretty shit but for satisfying Elua of Muslims how are they doing? It seems to me that apart from failing to export their values enough Saudi Arabia is as great as it can be. Of course in a world with Western cultural dominance it may be completely unsustainable. 

      I also think the owg with a single government doesn't work as soon as other intelligences exist as then it's back to having two countries and one not spending on military

    Theoretically, you could also keep looking for new whale carcasses and/or murder a few billion whale-eaters at regular intervals so that there is always a surplus.

  That's a very insightful and thought-provoking article.

  I particularly liked the point that the system *actively stifles/punishes/outcompetes individuals who want to change the rules*. The whole, "Be the change you want to see in the world" is a noble idea - but expect the world to push back.

  I was a little disappointed by its treatment of religion, which was mostly spoken about in the context of encouraging its members to have more children. Consider this angle instead: religions typically encourage their members to value others' wellbeing, thus working against Moloch at the grassroots level, and Abrahamic religions anticipate a future perfect monarch, which would defeat Moloch completely (just as a secular humanist might anticipate a future perfect AI).

  I seriously want someone to write a *Shadowrun* fic for this theme. Because even with all the magitech that allows a far better control of the situation, and actual dragons being on the top, Moloch is a problem bigger than ever. If it wasn't, why would anyone want to *run*?
