  Mess up a few times, pick up a few more spells, the loops go on. I love this story

    Agreed, I just wish it updated more often!

      I seriously can't decide whether I should continue reading this awesome story as soon as each chapter comes out, or try and forget about it until there's a larger chunk to read.

      The real problem is that I've tried the latter option, and I can't even forget about it long enough for more than three chapters to come out...

    The best thing about the story is how it has stakes despite this.

  Zorian should probably seek out that Mind Blank spell. Becoming a mind-slave used only to shuffle memory packets between restarts for the Aranea does not sound like a fun time.

  Though I wonder if Mind Blank would have some side effects given Zorian's nature..
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    Didn't Novelty or the matriarch say there were serious risks with using Mind Blank?
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:
      ```
      Keep in mind the incentives aranea have. Those risks may have been misrepresented. I doubt that mind blank will be entirely safe for Zorian, but he does not actually have to use it. If he can convince the spiders that he is capable of casting the spell and is committed to using it for self-defence, he should be relatively safe.
      ```

    - u/elevul:
      ```
      IIRC she said long term use of the spell has serious risks, but using it for short term emergency situations shouldn't be that big of an issue.

    "No, thank you. A few days ago, when I was setting up my account, I had several people tell me that paying anything for a story they can read for free is stupid, and that I'm stupid for trying it. Thanks to you and the other 5 people who donated, I can feel smug at their failed predictions of doom and gloom. "

    There are a lot of high quality authors who I like a lot who work for free, and I do appreciate the knowledge that I am helping them avoid predictions of doom and gloom about how valuable their work is.

    $1 to him, $1 to Wildbow. It's not much, but that's as much as my poor student ass can spare for now.

      I'm the same too (with $2 each). After about four chapters to be sure that he wasn't going to do anything odd or different with a new Patreon account. You know, verify before trusting?

  The way I see it, the spiders were suspicious of Zorian, made some investigations of their own, discovered that the whole Cyoria web was dead, decided to do a deep search of Zorian's mind to find out his involvement, knew they weren't going to get his cooperation and so decided they'd have to play rough.  The original timetable for getting back to him was two days, that it took eight days is pretty significant.

  Since I only recently started reading this, and have only participated in some of the discussion on an anime forum, I'm curious about how popular certain theories are:

  * Zach's guardian (Tesen Zveri) as Red Robe-
   Someone Zach might have turned to early in the loops who he didn't realize was untrustworthy, after somehow securing his place in the loops could have messed with Zach's soul/mind. Also has a "Z" name, and the invaders are thought to have had agents in place in the government.  He also could have hid the fact if Zach was in a coma for Zorian's first 7 loops, but wouldn't have been close enough to the school to know that Zorian had spent a number of loops like that as well.

  * The aranea are just kicked out of the loop, not actually dead.

  * The loop is a simulation of the next month based how things were at the beginning of it, caused by the Sovereign's Gate, and no actual time travel is actually happening.
  ```

  - u/elevul:
    ```
    1. Possible, but we don't have enough data to know either way.

    2. Obvious, since no spell to kill a soul exists.

    3. Very interesting hypothesis. I wonder if the simulation would take more energy/magic to sustain than a real time loop. Would be definitely something to keep in mind while reading.

  Anyone remember the hunter spider a while back, with poison that can halt spells? 

  Think he could use it as a weapon against red robe?
  ```

  - u/nytelios:
    ```
    No mention of venom milking spells yet! There's always the nearly impossible chance he gets good enough to mind control the grey hunter.
    ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    He'd have to build a poison super soaker.
    ```

    - u/Cheese_Ninja:
      ```
      I remember your name from the 17thshard forums.  I started reading this story a few weeks ago.

      I was hoping that the grey hunter's ability to shrug off most direct attack spells wouldn't actually work on mental magic, so that at some point in the story he can deliver the egg to Silverlake by just walking the grey hunter up to her while the spider was under his mental control.  (The same way the matriarch used the worm in one of the loops to fight off invaders.) He still hasn't managed to truly shock any of complete hardass teachers yet.  And that eventually he'd use the grey hunter against the invaders directly.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        He noted when he was attacking the men while protecting the priest that psionic attacks took mana. As such, they probably have a magic component and the spider would be resistant to assault. 

        He might later be able to find a way to overcome that of course, just it would be another barrier to get through, and he'd need to have a very strong psionic assault.
        ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  Some kind of dead man's switch on his suicide ring would be a very good idea if he can make that work. That way he doesn't have to worry about aranea making him forget about it.
  ```

  - u/elevul:
    ```
    Multi-layered one:

    - *Mental attack detected* 

    - **Normal egg shield casted**

    - *Egg shield broken*

    - **Mind Blank casted**

    - *Mind Blank is somehow bypassed/broken/stops working for whatever reason*

    - **Suicide**
    ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      I'd worry that a powerful dispel would smash through multiple layers of the protection. He'd do better to capture an Aranea and make a specialized spell to annoy or kill them.
      ```

    - u/TimTravel:
      ```
      That sounds more like a Contingency spell than a dead man's switch but that's good too.
      ```

- u/chaosmosis:
  ```
  Zorian is shockingly sane, compared to most other protagonists in time loop stories. He seems to have unshakable values. I hope Zach has a similar disposition.

  Looking back on the story, I can't help but feel Zorian's progress has been a little underwhelming. I don't ever want him to reach god tier, or even demigod tier, but at this stage in the game I feel like he ought to have several moderately powerful tricks under his belt. But all he has is his mental abilities.
  ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    I think his progress has been pretty well-foreshadowed, aside from the psionics, so I think this was done deliberately and I'm pretty happy with it. I'm just sad he doesn't have way more information / social power - presumably his problem can be eliminated with sufficient magical firepower, and he doesn't need to wield it himself, he just needs to figure out how to get existing power structures to do what he wants.
    ```

    - u/chaosmosis:
      ```
      Good point. Why isn't he blackmailing politicians yet?
      ```

      - u/Iconochasm:
        ```
        High likelihood of getting noticed by some of the many agents and saboteurs.  He's already made a very strong variant of that play, and it ended with all the arenea permadead.
        ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Would any of his goals be served by blackmailing politicians? Plus blackmailing politicians is very risky. What if they decide that the best way to handle him is to send a mentallic assassin to him to rip out the location of any blackmail material?
        ```

- u/MadScientist14159:
  ```
  Just had a thought:

  Divinations exist in this right?

  Spells that pluck information out of the void, that you didn't know before you cast them?

  Well, apart from the obvious (never go full Contessa), you could maybe make a "Calculate Spell Formula" spell to let you invent new spell formulae with near-zero effort. And once that's done you can effectively break the game.
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Divination spells tend to track a known marker from what we've seen e.g. find soul stamp, find friend, whatever. 

    To find a particular spell formula he'd need an example of that spell formula or something like that, and for it to not be shielded.
    ```

- u/MarkArrows:
  ```
  I really can't wait to see what the other spiders are like :D 

  Always found the spiders to be one of the more unique races I've read about, and I really like how the culture is completely alien to ours.
  ```

- u/MadScientist14159:
  ```
  This is how you lose, Zorian.

  Next time, commit suicide as soon as you suspect an ambush, instead of giving them a chance to attack you.
  ```

  - u/TimTravel:
    ```
    There was a chance he could have escaped. He has finite time to work with so he doesn't want to waste resources. Still, that should have been the first thing he thought of.
    ```

    - u/MadScientist14159:
      ```
      The telepathic spiders turning you into a mind-slave memory packet courier forever is significantly more costly than ending a single loop.

      Once he knew he was at risk of that happening he should have just given the whole thing up as a bad job.
      ```

    - u/Nepene:
      ```
      He should be carefully weighting his resource expenditure based on predicted outcomes. Suppose each day is worth 1 utility point.

      If he becomes a mind slave that would likely be at least 1 gone. -1 utility points. I think that's a massive underestimate.

      Consider his probability of escaping. Suppose he has a 70% chance of escaping. This seems rather high, but whatever. He was about 18 days through a loop. He would gain a utility of 12/30*0.7=0.28 if he escaped with his life.

      The 1 lost loop plus the lost time in this loop would lose him 0.3 * 1+0.3 * 12/30=0.42 utility points. So even based on that incredibly conservative case he'd be worse off.

      Realistically, he could easily lose more than 1 loop, and he probably didn't have a 70% chance of surviving.  If he lost the next eighty years and only had a 50% chance of surviving then it would be an extremely bad idea.

      He shouldn't go in with an "I have finite time to work with, better risk it" attitude when facing threats to his long term survival. I can't imagine any probability calculation that's going to say it's a good idea in most cases. He should minimize his risks as much as possible, knowing that he needs to take some risks for his long term survival.
      ```

      - u/TimTravel:
        ```
        True, but he's not deciding between "fight to the death" and "immediately suicide". He can fight for a few seconds and see if it's easy to escape and fall back to the suicide plan if that fails, which is what he does. I agree he balanced it too far toward risk, but not quite as much as it seems at first glance.

        In either case, keep in mind the worst-case scenario is not just permadeath, it's the success of the undead invasion.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          The longer he fights the more risk he has of an adverse reaction or of failing to carry out the suicide plan. I'm doubtful that the additional risk of failing and becoming a mind slave is worth 12 days, especially since a few seconds isn't long enough to do a risk calculation. I think he balanced it far too much towards risk.

          Plus, even if he waits to fight for a few seconds he might be injured in those few seconds. He lost an entire restart compared to just losing 12 days.
          ```
