## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  How much more "dangerous" are cars than airplanes? 

  I feel that whenever I read these "airplanes are safer" comparisons they completely disregard basic nuance. Usually [they're in units of fatalities/miles traveled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromort#Travel) (or p(death)/mile), ignoring the fact that we'd be doing a lot less long distance travel without the convenience of planes (which can be hard to quantify, sure). It's like if some new technology enabled travel to the Andromeda galaxy -- on a per-one-way-trip basis, that trip could have a 99.9999...999% fatality rate (I think something like 1-10^-6476964305 or so? maybe?) and still be as safe as planes on a per-unit-mile basis. But we wouldn't call the trip itself safe. 

  (similarly, walking can be considered quite dangerous, if you compare it on a per-mile basis to e.g. driving across the country, but people rarely walk across the country, and those that do tend to be pretty good at it)

  Also, plane fight would most directly substitute for empty interstate highway travel and not urban travel, despite the former being [substantially safer than the latter](http://freakonomics.com/2010/01/29/the-irony-of-road-fear/). But those miles often all get lumped in together when dividing by total road miles traveled. And cars keep getting new safety features added in, which would put modern miles traveled even further out-of-sample (nevermind better crumple zones and airbags -- the econobox I bought last year has automatic emergency braking, active lane control, adaptive cruise control, automatic high beams, etc. though I'm sure some of that gets canceled out by risk compensation, and airplanes have probably received new safety features, too). Likewise, I've yet to see a treatment of this question break down the component risks of plane flight -- how much of a regional/directional/geographic effect is there? An age-of-plane effect? Time of departure? How much of the risk is fixed to takeoff and landing, vs. relative to the marginal air mile? etc. Plane crashes are rare enough that there's probably insufficient information to really resolve those effects, but still.

  (disclaimer -- I think walking, biking, and driving to be way more dangerous than most people give them credit for, and have adjusted my own behavior in light of imo a reasonable assessment of each activity's risks and benefits)

      This is actually an interesting question to me because I work in road safety and I am planning on travelling to Cambodia next month for a holiday. 

      We want to travel between Siem Reap and Phnom Phen, which is either $20 for a 6.5 hour bus trip, $75 for a 5.5 hour taxi ride, or $150 for a 45 minute flight (+ time and cost overheads for getting to/from the airport). All figures for two travellers.

      My main concern is the amount of stress (flights are stressful! but so is being on a bus full of tourists! and being at the mercy of a potentially crooked taxi driver!), and the amount of time spent travelling vs potentially enjoying the holiday.

      Quick maffs: holiday is costing about $150/person/day so $8/person/hr so, assuming no marginal discounting saving one hour on the bus trip is not worth the price of the taxi, and saving 6 hours is not the worth the cost of the flight. 

      But I think a 6 hour bus ride would be *miserable*, while a 45 minute flight is quite pleasant. (But then getting taxis to/from airport is *miserable* - unless both hotels offer airport transfers...)

      Anyway this ended up being about something completely different but now I'm wondering what AirAsia's safety record is vs Cambodian tourist bus companies vs Cambodian taxis.

      Interesting! I think framing it on an averaged, per-trip basis can be useful for personal decision-making -- I wouldn't avoid a drive to the grocer, so why balk at a flight? -- even if the two aren't quite interchangeable (I'd benefit a lot more from a flight than a drive, typically; flights also then to cost more at short distance, both in $ and opportunity, though they get cheaper at long distance unless you value your time little and your car is fuel efficient and spacious enough to sleep in).

      It still doesn't quite "feel" right for evaluating which mode of travel is "safer", though perhaps that's just a result of the question being poorly framed. I'd be curious how the "relative risk" of flights/cars changes as a function of distance, for example. Maybe I'll play around with some data when I have a bored moment.

    I think deaths/mile is a good measurement if you're actually considering using one or the other for the same trip.  Your complaints might be valid for considering some nebulous quality of "safeness", but if you need to get from point A to point B and are wondering whether to use a car or a plane to get there, deaths/mile is the quantity that actually matters in the safety column of your cost/benefit analysis.
