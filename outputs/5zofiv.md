## [Challenge Companion] Man vs Nature

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the biweekly challenge, post recommendations, ideas, or general thoughts below.**

To start, two recommendations:

* *Hatchet* by Gary Paulson
* *The Martian* by Andy Weir

I think that, like mysteries, Man vs Nature stories will tend to be rational (or close to rational) unless the author screws something up. Man vs Man stories and Man vs Society stories allow far more room for fudging, and there's more counterplay between the protagonist and antagonist -- which gives a lot more room for railroading.

Man vs Nature stories have, at their core, an unthinking opponent, whether it takes the form of a natural disaster, a death world, or some kind of animal. If you're writing a story about problem-solving, that's a boon, since you only really need to model one mind, and there's no need for complex recursion (e.g. he knows that I know that he knows). Despite that, or maybe because of that, Man vs Nature stories can be very satisfactory in terms of vicarious problem-solving. They can also offer a welcome respite from back-stabbing, infighting, etc. (unless you want to make that part of the fun).
