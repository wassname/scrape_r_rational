  Interesting plan. My first thought was that they could transmit back information by having signs set up where death row prisoners are executed, or terminally ill patient beds. 

  Of course, the plan could be easily flawed depending on a few details we don't know. If the other woman's location at this time could not be found, even by Hannah dedicating her life to it, then Hannah is trapped into devoting her life to trying to track her down, and failing. If Hannah would be dissuaded by a message saying that finding this woman is impossible, then she could receive that message anyway if time here works a la HPMOR and chooses scenarios which minimise complexity. 

  Alternately, it's entirely possible that Hannah is not being strictly honest about this precommitment, in which case this would also fail. It's quite a big ask to dedicate your life to a mission  based on information from someone you've just met,                especially if that person proceeds to not give you any useful information about your own death. Even if she doesn't think Simon is lying, he could easily have reached some incorrect assumptions about his power.

  Also, I think this story is large enough to benefit from a table of contents. Or placed more prominently should one already exist, since a cursory scan couldn't find it.

  **Synopsis**

  Across the world, one hundred adolescents unexpectedly find themselves in possession of superpowers, running the gamut from conventional to world-breaking to annoyingly limited. But despite the diversity of powers, certain patterns emerge, and as the Children begin to find each other, they realize that the world itself may be in great peril.

  Heroes save the world, but will they succeed in being heroes?
