    [](/abbored) Yeah, this story started off fantastic, but the last couple have pretty much lost my interest.   If everything is based off of what he desires, hopefully he'll realize just how crappy this situation is and can reverse it.

    Might have to skip a chapter or two then reevaluate.

    > literally can't even think words because the guy thinks it's sexier that way

    I'm unclear here: are you referring to the sneaking voice bondage thing that's been spooling up for the past few chapters, or the nonverbality mindfuck from the mirrordrops? It rather matters which before I respond.

  > The lovers we pass all seem contemplative and quiet, focused on each other, the ones who do look up doing so with annoyance at our lack of reverence, and in the space this feels as right as it felt coming so repeatedly close to being preyed on by something met in the darkness did in the place we came from.

  Okay, I gotta say.

  That sentence?

  It's grammatically correct.

  But it _shouldn't be_.

    My happy place is *Sade Hall*. This has a certain effect on grammatic sensibility.

  I wanted to talk about this story so much I just signed up. Please excuse the fresh account.

  As for pets current mute catgirling, she said that would only be a thing while the mirrordrops are working. I hope that’s soon, the story just isn’t the same without her commentary.

  As for her other problems speaking, I’m pretty sure they managed to ‘accidently-but-wanted-it’ do the proper Hollow Heart binding ritual together on the raft – there was a magic circle and all. My interpretation of the term Hollow Heart is that the ‘hollow’ in a heart wants to be filled by the desires and wishes of the other person, creating a very intense relationship, almost a merging.

  I’m more worried about the architecture being out of character in this chapter. Previously, the world there has shown itself to have a flair for being dramatic, but ultimately it’s behaviour has been benign and even helpful (surfacing near a raft, landing in a jacuzzi). As I was reading, I assumed that the cracking floor was just an illusion designed to impress on lovers (and Hollow Hearts specifically) the necessity of staying together and the emotional peril of being apart, but the cuts and blood loss turned out to be fairly nasty. Combined with unmarked gravity changes, that’s pretty brutal for a world that has seemed a safe fantasyland until now. I’m guessing this is another initiation, or a trial of some sort? Or have they passed into a different gods realm?

  I think I’ve identified what the plot is based on, it’s one of the famous ones. I’m expecting more trials soon, meeting previously introduced people, and I’m sure we haven’t see the last of the magic sword. I’m still holding out for the story’s rationality, it’s a common problem with exposition in worldbuilding type stories that you end up with a lot of threads back into areas that haven’t been explained yet.

  Next chapter: Blue eyes and pet explore rooms 1336 and 1338 having long sex scenes in both of them.
