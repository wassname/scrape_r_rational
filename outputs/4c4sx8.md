  So, Harry punishes people for killing, and then goes and kills two people. 

  The idea is great, and I like the plot analysis. I hadn't ever stopped to think about how the canon all fit together in terms of what people knew and when. It really puts things in a different light.

    Well, at least he isn't just a machine of rationality there. :p

    Dumbles did do a bit more than just killing, though. He manipulated his whole life for starters. Some emotional response is kinda expected.

  One problem with this idea is that if there is an idea that would break the setting, and it hasn't actually broken the setting, that probably means that there's something wrong with the idea that Harry didn't know about.

  Consider the muggle world analogy: You come up with this great idea that would let anyone make ten million dollars in the stock market.  Will this idea work?  Of course not.  If it actually worked, someone would have found it and abused it and there wouldn't be a stock market any more.

  All the easy munchkining ideas were already found  and either don't work any more, never worked, or are such a part of our lives that we don't even think of them as munchkin.  ("I have a great idea!  If we use this thing called 'fire', nobody will ever get attacked by animals in the nighttime again!  Nobody in the whole world....")

    Or that the setting is logically inconsistent. Which is actually the more likely possibility in fictional universes. If you've ever played a game of DnD with a lousy DM, you should know that just assuming the universe is logically consistent is objectively stupid, likely to miss you tons of opportunities, and a good way to get yourself killed.

    Let's say instead I'm in the 1700s, and I came up with the idea that doctors should wash their hands and instruments between operations. And wizarding society is about 1700s in their way of thinking (replace Aristotle with Merlin and Founders).

  In my imagination, HPJEV hears of such an incident with the Goblet on his first Thursday at Hogwarts, tries this, [HPMOR](#s "and finds himself stripped of his magic at the first name.")

  Nice.

  ... and Magic expands?
