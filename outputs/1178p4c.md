## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  Watching _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ had me wondering, are there any decent stories about fighting Death where Death definitively loses?
  ```

  - u/elephantiskon:
    ```
    Not an answer to your question, but would you say *Puss in Boots: The Last Wish* is anti-deathist? That would make me pretty keen to watch it actually.
    ```

    - u/Nulono:
      ```
      Unfortunately not, which is my one complaint with the movie. It certainly isn't pro-deathist in the sense that some stories present avoiding death as a moral failing or present death itself as something to embrace, but it does do the thing where it presents avoiding death and enjoying life as at odds with each other. The message at the end is very much "enjoy and fight for the life you have, but death is ultimately a fact of life it's futile to fight".
      ```

      - u/Nulono:
        ```
        There's a bit more nuance to it than that, but that involves going into the plot in more detail, so **spoilers ahead**.

        > **EDIT:** I originally had an extended synopsis of the plot here, but all you really need to know for context is that 1) the story revolves around Puss seeking to wish for more lives after frivolously wasting eight of his nine, and 2) >!the Big Bad Wolf, one of the primary antagonists, is revealed to be Death (_i.e._, the literal, physical personification of death itself)!<.

        Now, with that context established, I'll collect my thoughts on the themes of the movie.

        The movie is definitively not pro-deathist; Death is portrayed as a very clear villain who enjoys toying with and tormenting his victims/prey, rather than the value-neutral "punch-clock grim reaper" or the more positive "helpful ferryman of souls" common to more pro-deathist stories. There's also no indication that any sort of afterlife exists in this world; death is presented as very final, and very bad.

        Death is also portrayed in a more grounded manner than other stories' "immutable force of nature" versions. His edge over Puss seems to come entirely from being a more talented swordfighter; he doesn't really display any major preternatural powers beyond the inherent plot armor that comes with being part of an ongoing franchise that isn't going to take the radical step of literally killing off Death. Because of this, it doesn't seem entirely implausible that Death _could_ be defeated, in theory, by a good enough fighter.

        When it comes to the movie's treatment of the idea of defeating/cheating death, that's a bit complicated. Puss plans on wishing for an extra set of nine lives rather than immortality or an infinite number of lives, but he's established to be bad at both math and thinking things through, so that may be more of a mental block than an actual limitation or value judgement. Cats getting to cheat death eight times is also presented as at best a blessing to be appreciated and at worst a morally neutral fact of life, with its only rejection coming from the mouth of Death, a clear villain.

        That said, the movie establishes pretty strong thematic ties between Puss's pursuit of extra lives and his tendency to flee when he gets the least bit frightened (_e.g._, getting cold ~~feet~~ paws and leaving his love interest at the altar, or immediately retiring due to his newfound fear of death). So while the idea of escaping death isn't itself presented as morally problematic, Puss's specific quest to do so is presented as a "quick fix" that's emblematic of one of his major character flaws.

        Since Puss's penultimate line to Death is "I know I can never defeat you, _lobo_, but I will never stop fighting for _this_ life", I'd probably say that the movie presents the idea of fighting death as ultimately futile, but not necessarily a bad thing so long as it doesn't consume one's life. It acknowledges death as something bad to be avoided, but lacks the optimism shown by more confidently anti-deathist fiction; the best it dares envision is fighting to a standstill.

        When it comes to its anti-deathist credentials, _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ is unfortunately (no pun intended) rather fatalist.
        ```

        - u/Revlar:
          ```
          I do have an argument to put forward here: I think the movie is trying to be less deathist. I have the distinct impression, though this is speculation, that an earlier version of the screenplay would've had Goldilocks >!looking to wish her original parents back to life, and ultimately being convinced not to!<. I think that version of the movie would've been much more deathist.

          How anime would it have been for Puss to >!wish for a sword when Death shows up at the end!<? Goddamn, just thinking about that made my Kamina grow five times the size.

- u/MagicWeasel:
  ```
  I just recently finished *The Sparrow*, a sci-fi novel. It was very good, and very different from other stuff in its genre (first contact). It's about a disasterous first contact between humans and aliens, with the humans being a bunch of jesuits (including like 3 priests) that visit an alien planet and then, through a series of unfortunate events, really fuck up. (Don't worry, this is all known from like the second chapter). And I know what you're thinking - no, the jesuits weren't the official first contact troop sent from Earth, in fact the mission was a secret - the church with all its resources was just able to find this expedition before the UN got its shit together. 

  The main character is a linguist/priest and the rational elements are to do with the spec evo of the alien society, the problems the explorers encounter and their ways of solving them, and the biases that cause a lot of the problems.

  It's dark and haunting. I found it slow to start but once it all came together it was very enjoyable.

- u/Banarok:
  ```
  so i'm looking for something decently written that have a character go through physical transformations that isn't just a power romp, anything from transforming to a eldrich horror to a kitten is fine as long as it's either progressive or conditional instead of "can take the shape at will".

  and just so they don't get recommended, i have read and do enjoy thundamoo's work.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Soldier Son trilogy by Robin Hobb might apply. The setting is a fantasy analogue of 18th century Manifest Destiny america, as in settlers expanding and natives relentlessly getting pushed back. The protagonist a young man on the colonial side that gets a disease/condition that makes him enourmously fat for no discernible reason, and for a cure he must go into the native lands. The change is progressive, but only for the first book, iirc. 

    Another that come to mind is Elantris by Brandon Sanderson, but I don't recall if the change is progressive or not.
    ```

    - u/Revlar:
      ```
      This and the last trilogies are the ones I haven't read. Would you recommend it? I honestly felt very cheated by the end of Liveship, but I stuck with it and read Rainwild and Tawny Man and enjoyed those a lot more.

      I would actually recommend Rainwild for physical transformations, if you're reading /u/Banarok , but sadly it might be best to go into that one with some context from previous trilogies in the same setting.

      Edit: And now I realize you already kind of mentioned this in your reply.
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        It has a lot of interesting ideas and cool moments, but if you found the end of liveship disappointing, you'll hate this one. The ending is extremely anti-climactic. 

        If you're curious, basically the reason for Nevare's condition happens because [mild book 2 spoilers]: >!the indigenous people, the specks, are trying to find a way to halt the expansion of Gernia into their lands.!< However, the way they do is kind of a copout, iirc. [major book 3 ending spoilers]: >!Once they get enough insight into Nevare's culture, that the expansion is built on an economic incentive, they realize they can redirect this incentive by just... revealing the location of a gold mine on Nevare's family's property. The resulting gold boom draws the settlers that would be going east into going there instead, solving the problem for a few decades. Meh.!< 

        Not hobb's best effort imo, though it certainly matches her high standard for misery porn. I'd hate to be one of her protagonists.
        ```

        - u/Banarok:
          ```
          that being said, hobb don't hold a candle to Ian irvine's well of echoes series when it come to misery porn, that poor protagonist is abused to hell and back, almost literally.

          i did love well of echoes though, it was interesting and you were constantly waiting for the protagonist harrowing journey to get better.

          although that being said, Hobb does wallow more into the Misery then Irvine, where in irvine it's more just described as rough, so i guess as misery porn Hobb might actually be superior even if the protagonist is Well of echoes is more abused.
          ```

    - u/Banarok:
      ```
      i'll check them out, Robin hobb i know had a bit of physical change in the soul ship triology even if it was a bit "meh" overall as it was basically just growing scaled gloves, but in general i liked hobb, i started reading a soldiers son but didn't get far until something got me to put it down (don't remember what), i'll give it another try.

      havn't actualy read any brandon sanderson yet, so Elantris might be as good as entrypoint, thanks for the recommendations.

  Can anybody recommend any novels where the viewpoint character changes from being moderately unambitious to being driven by personal ambition?

  I am reading the Worm fanfic [Wiki Warrior](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wiki-warrior.64766/#post-14950769) in which Taylor’s superpower is a random effect chosen using the random page button on Wikipedia. The characters take a lot of risks and are almost intentionally reckless due to the nature of the power, so I wouldn’t call it rational, but the author does a good job of keeping track of all the weird persistent effects and their consequences as things get more and more chaotic. 

  Another funny random magic power story with a little less detail and a bit more insanity: The commoner curse of 300 wands 
  A group of 0th level commoners are tasked by a wizard to test a barrel of wands with random effects in a D&D world. The results are… Random.

    When I tried reading Wiki Warrior a couple of years ago, it was incredibly difficult to parse what was happening; only around one in four rolls was shown, so mostly it was non sequiturs as things happened with no rhyme or reason. 

    Though the author did say they were doing a rewrite, so it's likely much more coherent now.

    - u/andor3333:

        Great that it's better now! I made a comment on r/WormFanfic back when I read it originally and the author responded mentioning a pending rewrite and explained that they omitted some rolls because they felt it was too roll-heavy at times. Glad that they improved the communication of effects.

    As a point of reference, there are near-identical lists of Wiki Warrior-style fics on [Sufficient Velocity](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/wiki-warrior-power-and-fanfic-discussion-rec-idea-thread.95989/) and [Space Battles](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/wiki-warrior-power-and-fanfic-discussion-rec-idea-thread.971134/).

    Recommendations-wise, I have a [rated list of Wiki Warrior-flavored Worm fic](https://www.reddit.com/user/ahasuerus_isfdb/comments/ue85kb/worm_fan_fic_ratings_wiki_warrior/). The only non-Worm Wiki Warrior fic that I am following is [Super Randomizer Lux](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/super-randomizer-lux-league-of-legends-multi.947122/) (rewritten version), but it doesn't quite make my recommended list.

    I find that the main problem with rationality-aspiring Wiki Warrior fics is that using a random power generator in any kind of planned action is an obviously bad idea. The power is best leveraged in an R&D environment, at least as long as some of the summoned items and effects are permanent. This limitation quickly becomes a narrative issue because you can only get so much mileage out of "power testing" scenes. It limits the author's options, but you can still do quite a bit with it, e.g.:

    * put the protagonist under a significant amount of pressure necessitating power use
    * make the protagonist a supplier/team leader who provides the team with useful items and abilities (Super Randomizer Lux does it quite a bit); unlocks the "kingdom building" route
    * make the protagonist use only permanently gained powers in the field while doing R&D at a secure base (except in emergencies); unlocks the "progression fantasy" route
    ```

  Recommending the webnovel **The Demon Prince Goes to the Academy**, originally recommended to me on the Arrogant Young Master discord server. 

  This is currently in my top 7 webnovels, and casually stomps most things I've consumed recently, despite being translated and not complete(but pretty long, currently has 258 chapters out and is being translated consistently). It's got *excellent* characterization and the development of the story is extremely satisfying. I also really enjoy something the author does that's somewhat like the world-building Alexander Wales does in which he expands on why a particular object or situation became the way that it is. 

  A synopsis, the author of a webnovel gets placed in the body of the Demon Prince in his webnovel as punishment for writing his story badly. He gets sent with a system that can rewrite part of the (badly written) story, and is incentivized to change the story in order to get points. A large part of the story is interacting with the very developed cast in and out of a school setting. All the characters are fleshed out and behave consistently according to their goals and understanding of the situation.

  Going to recommend some relevant manga I've been reading recently(most are available, like all other manga, on [mangadex.org](https://mangadex.org)):

  * **Oshi No Ko** (really picking up compared to the last time I recced it, and the anime will be coming out in the summer I believe)
  * **Risou no Himo Seikatsu** (somewhat erotic, mainly in the beginning, but the main focus is the kingdom building and diplomatic relations)
  * **I'm Standing on a Million Lives** (still good)
  * **Yomi no Tsugai** (Hiromu Arakawa, the creator of Full Metal Alchemist, is writing this manga and it's got a solid beginning. Great flavour of abilities, namely tied to "tsugai" which are basically folk spirits)
  * **The World of Otome Games is Tough for Mobs** (this is good, the MC is a bit excessively annoying but the story progresses well enough. Better than your usual isekai fare *and* it's unique, but it hasn't completely gotten rid of its roots)
  * **Hirayasumi** (this is wholesome, the atmosphere conveyed by the drawing is very calming and nice. A slice of life on a part timer and the people around him)
  * **Chainsaw Man** (been reading Part 2, this is pretty good, Fujimoto has a unique style of writing manga)
  * **Regressor Instruction Manual** (a manwha, focused on manipulation and using people in a LitRPG dungeon style setting. It's good, but the MC might put people off, he's a bit much overall, very showy)
  * **The Ember Knight** (a manwha, most recommended work in this short list, basically a character with just average physical strength must masquerade as their brother who is very strong, among a lot of other very strong people. He uses lots of tricks and techniques to do so. Highly rational MC, somewhat rational side characters, great plot, great action)
  * **Deus** (someone told me to read Deus, I think on this subreddit, and it seems pretty good, only a few chapters out so far though)
  * **Versus** (by the creator of One Punch Man, only a few chapters out but it seems interesting and I still love the artist Murata's style)

  Not a manga, but I recently finished **The Tatami Galaxy** (anime) and I really liked it, was a bit of a slog in the middle but I enjoyed the ending.

  I started reading **The Systemic Lands** a while ago, to get a glimpse at how anti-social a main character could get. I dropped it at Chapter 46, he'd just >!killed all the old government in the town and was holed up in his house.!< Does the story ... get better? It kind felt like it wasn't going anywhere and he'd just pointlessly made his situation more complicated.

  I'd also like some translated webnovel recommendations, although just to note I already plan to read Lord of Mysteries.

  Thanks!

    I tried reading the Demon Price Goes To The Academy but just couldn't get into it. The author provides hardly any character or environmental descriptions, which I just found extremely jarring.

    > The Systemic Lands ... Does the story ... get better? It kind felt like it wasn't going anywhere and he'd just pointlessly made his situation more complicated.

    The story has its flaws, most notable being cruel and self-important MC. Another is author bending probabilities to make the story dark fantasy.

    Unfortunately its one of the very few stories that explicitly values Knowledge, Hard Work+Optimization and Preparation, and tells about it somewhat plausibly, not hollywood magic style. 

    I cant really stop reading that.

    >I'd also like some translated webnovel recommendations, although just to note I already plan to read Lord of Mysteries.

    If you like Lord of Mysteries and Mother of Learning, try Shadow Slave. I binged it due to the recommendation in this very thread. 

    It is an epic mystery (detective) novel just like LoM and MoL, with plenty of details turning out to be foreshadowing.

    I was told that its setting is Dark Souls style, but I have not played the game, so cant confirm.

    Also, being long (700 chapters; it is original, not a translation) and still ongoing, delaying to read it might be a good idea.

  I've been really enjoying [Super Supportive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63759/super-supportive-superhero-system-novel), which is basically a superhero novel about someone who's determined to be a sidekick. It's fairly slow paced so far (at chapter 15 the MC still doesn't have super powers yet, though he could if he wanted to >!since superpowers go through a trading window before being bound to a user - the MC is using this opportunity to try for a support power set!<). 

  So far there's been a lot of great character building and it's touched on some discussion of power builds, and there's been at least one semi-fairplay whodunnit sort of thing with the mystery of "what's Gorgon's dietary restriction".

  Giving a very conditional recommendation for the quest **[Kingdom Hearts: Promises Kept](https://fiction.live/stories/Kingdom-Hearts-Promises-Kept/knv5j4Daofh7EsX7k/home)**. It's definitely an odd one, it gripped me harder than any story has gripped me for literal months, rekindled my interest in the games enough to prod me into finishing the first one, and made me absolutely desperate to find someone to gush about this quest to, but it's also been getting increasingly distracted by its desire to be a power fantasy *and* a very horny harem fantasy, and the narrative is suffering because of it. Still easily a passing grade, but Your Mileage May Vary. And to be clear, NSFW warning on this one due to lots of explicit sex scenes. 

  > Positives:

  1) **It is by far the best rewrite of the Kingdom Hearts universe that I have ever found.** I have yearned for something like this for so many years, because Kingdom Hearts devolves into such a convoluted pile of overwrought bullshit that squanders most of the things I actually like about it. The individual Worlds are fleshed out really well, with the author sampling a much wider array of fictional universes to populate its multiverse, and the quality of their story arcs range from decent to Solid Gold That Makes Me Remember Why I Read Fanfiction In The First Place. They are even putting the entire idea of "we need to keep the Worlds seperate and not get involved in local affairs" under a spotlight, with a persistent philosophical disagreement between Donald and Sora about this that they go back and forth on.

  2) **Kairi has a much stronger story presence, being the secondary PoV Protagonist and splits the narrative spotlight with Sora.** This is the most obvious and immediate improvement, I have long believed that KH focuses way too much on Sora, that his simple goodness works far better for the first game than it does for literally any game after that, and that the rest of the franchise should've instead been about Kairi and her two dumbass boyfriends. Here, Kairi is a bonafide plot-mover with a spine of steel and the heart of a warrior. She also (slight spoilers for the end of the prologue arc) >!successfully kickstarts the Destiny Islands OT3 with female!Riku and Sora before the prologue arc is over!<, so she's the best. I will complain later about the Harem Fantasy warping female characters to be obsessed with Sora, but Kairi gets a free pass even though she embodies it because it is completely justified by her backstory. She is a well-written character who is defined by the formative trauma of her early life, and Sora's support is literally the only reason why she isn't still a hollow husk of a girl sitting alone in her room. The author's exploration of this idea later on results in the undisputed best scene in the entire story.

  3) **The Rule of Cool is very strong here and results in excellent fight scenes.** Combat is just very well-written to flow and maintain tension, and the boss fights that capstone each individual arc are all bangers. 

  > Negatives:

  1) **The Power Fantasy goes too far in making Sora powerful, he learns a bit too quickly and there is a continuous procession of new skills and powers and resources and allies.** There are a few specific fights later on where the described power imbalance is insane, but he still pulls victories out of his ass. Some of this is a consequence of game mechanics, there is an Omake Shop where reader-created side stories accumulate Omake Points, which can be spent to acquire a wide array of advantages, this ranges from skill advancement to nailing a personal conversation to rerolling failed checks. And when several of these bonuses are spent at the same time, oh boy do you feel it. 

  2) **The Harem Fantasy goes too far in making Sora irresistable to women, and many of their characterizations suffer for it.** Those caught in his orbit fall utterly in love very very quickly, and a good chunk of their personal motivation is immediately allocated to making Sora happy in all ways but especially sexually. Horniness is injected more and more into the regular narrative, and sex scenes get increasingly common. I'm definitely not someone who is put off by explicit sex scenes in any way, but it's getting to the point where it feels like the story is getting really distracted by the horny. My biggest objection is the degree to which it affects the characterizations of the women involved. For a few of them in particular, loving Sora starts taking up more and more of their displayed behavior/priorities, and if you turn a critical eye towards the whole situation, it can feel a bit creepy. As I said earlier, Kairi gets a free pass because it's very strongly justified, but everyone else does not.

  3) **Everything from the list of cast members to the number of trainable skills is getting increasingly bloated and getting harder to keep track of.** Too many cast members is the biggest thing, because the more there are the less screentime and development each of them get. Having a strong core cast that get slowly expanded over time, with some members being explicitly secondary, is really important to avoid this problem, and it just happens so quickly here. Next we have the number of systems that get added to the list of things to train. Right away we learn that Pokemon have been appearing all over the Multiverse after their World fell to the Heartless, and both of our protagonists are given the beginnings of a pokemon team which also get individually stat-allocated and trained. Several worlds introduce yet more systems to be integrated into the power base, yet another set of skills to juggle and train. It all just gets increasingly complex and it's hard to keep a solid grip on what everyone can do.

  4) **The general desire for an indulgently positive tone gives the story some of that Fix-It energy, which can kinda undercut its own attempts at delivering emotional punches.** The primary culprit is Summoning Magic; it is just a little too powerful, and it trivializes a lot of serious problems almost as soon as they are introduced. For a specific example of this (Spoilers for something soon after the Prologue ends), >!Kairi and Sora are shunted off into entirely different Worlds, with Sora at Traverse Town, and Kairi's destination is basically impossible to leave until she accomplishes a number of things including getting the money to build a full spaceship. However, she quickly encounters a Traverse Town agent who has a direct communication line with Merlin, who can easily Summon her there for multiple days at a time, so she can have her big romantic reunion/mini-vacation with Sora almost immmediately before she goes off to do those things. It really undercuts the emotional impact of being separated!<.

    How familiar with KH do you need to be to read the quest? Also, any other really good quests you've read on fiction.live? I've never really gotten into anything in there due to the premises seeming to be more porn than plot on average.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:

      I don't think you need KH knowledge, it starts from the first game and doesn't assume any lore knowledge. At most you won't recognize the plot implications of certain changes from canon. 

      I've been diving into the site for a few weeks now, and while I have a lot to go through still, this is the only quest I'd call "Great". But most of them are still easy to read, the site culture of being fairly indulgent towards reader desires mean that few of them wallow around in angst and misery. Here are the most decent ones. All of them are sadly kinda short. Varying degrees of NSFW. 

      - **[Love Bites; or, My Reluctant Married Life with a Bratty Vampire Princess](https://fiction.live/stories/Love-Bites-or-My-Reluctant-Married-Life-with-a-Bratty-Vampire-Princess/yP8SRBKt3x7kmrbGi/home)**. Original fantasy universe with a variety of humanoid fantasy races, you follow a religious zealot mercenary who left her home and identity behind to fight against The Demon King, and ended up becoming his killer. Worldwide fame and unmatched prestige follows suit, but she quickly becomes entangled in the plot of a powerful Vampire Queen. Pretty well written so far, I especially enjoy the characterization of the protagonist, but it is also fairly short and has been in hibernation for about a year I think. The author is still around and vocally wants to bring it back, so there is hope. Either way, I liked what was there.

      - **[A Well Earned Vacation](https://fiction.live/stories/A-Well-Earned-Vacation/gL8apeKxwYGPHqzEE/home)**. This one is a bit weird, a post-canon Taylor Hebert isekai's into a baby in the One Piece setting, and promptly decides to establish a massive crime empire and try to take over the world. So yeah, her characterization is a bit odd here, she is arguably going backwards in her character arc, but there are sparks of great writing and it's easy to read. Just kinda chill and indulgent towards the readers, which is a staple of this website. She is also still a terrifyingly violent small child so she hasn't started her journey yet, but her future build of a Conquerors Haki specialist with a dope Devil Fruit is already fun. 

      - **[Yuushiro Quest](https://fiction.live/stories/Yuushiro-Quest/MBdwHzXeSJzQ2Muyx/home)**. Bleach Quest following the OC younger brother of Yoruichi as he goes to the Soul Reaper Academy at the same time as Rukia and other canon cast members. Enjoyable enough, again very easy to read, and this one is the most NSFW out of the three. Aaaaand this one is also very early as Yuushiro hasn't finished Academy yet.

      If you're trying to avoid porn, you can filter for non-M rated [stories]( https://fiction.live/stories?contentRating=teen&storyStatus=active,finished,hiatus&sort=active&page=1)

      or 

      [no smut](https://fiction.live/stories?terms=nosmut&page=1) / [no lewds](https://fiction.live/stories?contentRating=mature,nsfw,teen,unrated&storyStatus=active,finished,hiatus&sort=active&page=1&terms=nolewds)

      Live tab is pretty good for finding ongoing stuff, and if you're looking for a specific fandom, then filters work well too.

        You can also use `-` to avoid tags. `-smut` may work better than hoping an author tags `nosmut`.

        - u/ButterflyGirlEnjoyer:
          ```
          Yeah, that's also an option, although you may run into problems with people who don't tag their smut as smut (for example, when I try, I immediately see someone used the tag smutandplot instead)

  I have another request this week. Looking for more good RoyalRoad fics to read, but I’ve primarily stuck to the safe picks on Best Rated, and trusted recommendations from people ~~that don’t have garbage tastes.~~

  TL;DR: Need some relatively newer or not well known RoyalRoad fics of decent length to sink my teeth into. In terms of how well I know RR stories, I basically only live on the top 2-3 pages of Best Rated.


  Really in a hankering for more good, addicting, lengthy, and maybe experimental stories. The issue is that just picking at random disappoints me often, even when sticking to relatively safer new stories, they sometimes just die or explode, like Shade Touched, Artificial Jelly, Seaborn.

  Sometimes it ends up being good, like The Jester of Apocalypse or Born Different, or it ends up being mediocre like Saintess Summons Skeletons or Tunnel Rat, even if that latter one isn’t new in any sense of the word, I just thought I would finally read it recently, and was immensely disappointed.

  I know there’s definitely more really good fictions hidden in the depths of RoyalRoad, and I’m tired of gambling with the same stale mediocre litrpgs

    [Song of Ember.
    ](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/53449/song-of-ember)Criminally underrated since it isn't a trope based novel or some kind of progression fantasy story. Very much more the style of a traditional fantasy novel.
    ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    [Godclads](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59663/godclads-monster-mceldritchcyberpunkprogression) seems like it's right up your alley - good, long, super experimental and there's a new idea in every page of the first couple of chapters, but it introduces it all so smoothly that it just feels like future shock more than an info dump.

  - u/degenerate__weeb:

    [Super Supportive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63759/super-supportive-superhero-system-novel) looks neat. There was a removed post (self promotion?) by u/Sleyca on /r/ProgressionFantasy that I saw. It has a similar premise to Stray Cat Strut, where there's  mysterious aliens that provide a system with supernatural abilities. The system users are then drafted into "quests" against an unknown enemy, but they play as heroes or villains while on Earth. As the title suggests, the main character aspires to be a support/helper/sidekick class.

    The plot pacing is slow, 40k+ words and the main character doesn't have a class yet. I like what's there so far, there's some compelling plot threads that I'm eager to keep reading for, but I'm always wary of fics being abandoned. It's at least worth putting on your "Read Later" list.

    edit: I just noticed it was already recommended elsewhere in the thread, even. Wew.

    If you like cultivation novels there is [Memories of the Fall](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36051/memories-of-the-fall) which does intrigue, corruption, and politics really well in a cultivation world. You basically have to keep notes on the characters and clans though because there are so many and they often come back later in the story. 

    There is also a funny parody cultivation novel [Arrogant Young Master Template A Variation 4](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28601/arrogant-young-master-template-a-variation-4)

    Why bother ? Why would you limit yourself to RR? 

    &#x200B;

    >The issue is that just picking at random disappoints me often, even when sticking to relatively safer new stories, they sometimes just die or explode, like Shade Touched, Artificial Jelly, Seaborn.

    Those are the opposite of safe, there's a reason many people filter stories by minimum word count / age. For instance I don't bother unless it's older than 6m and the author is still consistent.

    &#x200B;

    My advice and what I've been doing lately is, go to goodreads, lookup some book you enjoy. Look at the reviews pick a couple reviewers with lots of reviews. Filter their reviews by other books you enjoy / dislike to see if your tastes match. 

    &#x200B;

    If so, go read stuff they've enjoyed and you haven't read yet. 

    &#x200B;

    It's a bit of a setup but after you do it the first time you'll have another reliable source of decent recs. Add a couple of those people to your favorites and you're set.

      > Why would you limit yourself to RR? 

      Not OP, It has a pretty decent interface for discovery and it's frictionless. That's all you need tbh to make it the first stop shop.

      Definitely agree with going to read actual published books, they have a much higher quality control and editorial input to ensure the books don't just go on forever.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        RR is useful but after you've found 90% of the decent fiction available, there's not much point scraping the bottom of the barrel for more. 

        &#x200B;

        Go look somewhere else, in a few months you can check again. Ideally you'll have several sources to rely on. Limiting yourself to one just because it's the one you're familiar with is unwise.
        ```

        - u/ProfessorPhi:
          ```
          Oh I definitely agree. I went through a phase as op and I gave you the reason. It's the best bang for buck when starting out reading web fiction.

      Thoughts and premise up to Chapter 17 (2.4% of total length):

      Superpowers with a flavor of litrpg is obtained by a person being inflicted with a nightmare in which they need to survive a trial. I don't think it's too much of a spoiler to say that the MC's trial in the nightmare is surviving a dire situation with an aspect/trait/class of Temple Slave. >!After he completes the trial, he gets what he believes to be the world's first/only Divine aspect.!< 

      Not the OP and seeing as I stopped once he got back to the waking world with powers, I don't know for sure what makes it good but it might be that korean progression webtoons/novels are popular right now and this resembles those. Personally, >!I think this is going to be hitting the clear trials -> gain power -> defeat malicious trial giver story beats so if that sounds like a good time, give it a try. I wasn't a fan of the prose but there are only a few actual grammatical mistakes so far. I found the MC and certain plot points a bit eye rolling but that's just me. My favorite novels tend to have the main characters being right maybe three quarters of the time and I have a feeling that this MC is going to be right almost always.!<
