## Deconstruction and Reconstruction

### Post:

What I've seen for definitions of these terms haven't been very concrete, in the sense of asking "What is the difference?". I came across this [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3e9tzs/the_two_types_of_rational_fanfic_ffd/) and thought it meshed quite well with what I thought of them: Type 1 = Reconstruction and Type 2 = Deconstruction.

I modeled it like this.

The author sets up the premise of the world, such as magical rules, societal structures and characters (Cause) and from there builds the details and peculiarities of the world, such as the applications of magic, what the world looks and feels like, and ultimately, the plot (Effect). In rational fiction, Cause ---> Effect. In irrational fiction, Cause -/-> Effect. Given that we can't wrangle them to magically join up again, to make a rational fanfic we need to keep either the original Cause or the original Effect.

Keeping the original Cause will create a deconstruction: What would actually happen if the rules set out were followed through? The result is usually a completely different genre from the original (This train goes to Grimdark, first stop, Edgeville). Sometimes this is just used in comedy ([eg](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a262rb/not_quite_rational_but_entertainingly_close/)).

Keeping the original Effect will create a reconstruction: How can I achieve the plot and characters I love, but ensure that the world actually makes sense? This kind of story keeps the magical feeling of the original, but there will be some essential differences that will push the story this way or that. What things are kept and what things are cut are up to the author's individual solution.

A fanfic can naturally be any combination of the two (or something else entirely).

According to these definitions, almost every rational fanfic is first and foremost a reconstruction, including HPMOR and Worm.

Deconstructions off the top of my head

* Metropolitan Man
* Luminosity (I don't remember if it changes canon mechanics. If it doesn't then it's here)
* Bluer Shade of White
* Marked for Death (as far as I've seen)
* Significant Digits (?) (Arguably all fanfic sequels are deconstructions of the void that was left behind)

What do people think?

  I've always felt that HPMOR didn't know if it wanted to be a deconstruction or a reconstruction. There are several scenes where some completely illogical bit of worldbuilding is lampshaded and never brought up again (why doesn't anyone abuse the exchange rates between muggle and wizard money? Why doesn't anyone letter bomb the Wizengamot?), but there's *also* scenes where the world has been rational-ified (Dumbledore acts weird and inefficiently because he's trying to fulfill a prophecy,  Voldemort is cartoonishly evil because he's just doing a prep-run for his actual attempt at world domination). It leaves the whole thing feeling a bit confused

    HPMOR does a bit of both, but imho it's neither really because one way or another both deconstruction and reconstruction focus *on the original work*.

    Taking the most famous example I can think of: the mecha anime genre. *Evangelion* is a blatant deconstruction of it, takes the tropes and twists them, showing the result they would lead when applied to psychologically realistic characters (and let's face it, not even the most stable people to begin with). *Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann* is a reconstruction, in that it explicitly embraces the irrationality that drove the older, simpler stuff and makes it an actual rule of its setting, saying basically "fuck realism, we like giant robots BECAUSE THEY'RE AWESOME".

    Both have their own themes too (depression and human relationships for Eva, growth, loss and human spirit for TTGL), but in one way both works talk mainly *about the mecha genre itself*.

    So to be either a deconstruction or a reconstruction, HPMOR's main concern should be to talk about Harry Potter (the book series, not the character). But besides the occasional jab, I don't think that was ever EY's main aim. Rather, he wanted to *use* Harry Potter as a useful vehicle to lay down some ideas about rationality and narratives at large, and a lot of other stuff really. Especially as we go forward, the focus of HMPOR shifts away from talking about HP and moves on to talking about rationality at large, in a more general sense.

    Now this still passes through some criticism of HP, but there too I think there's a double nature for good reason. On one hand, the values expressed by HP as a series are mostly positive, and there's no reason to deconstruct them. On the other, though, the setting itself, and sometimes the characters' actions, seem to contradict those values, and do so mostly out of narrative convenience or author oversight, and there HPMOR sets to lampshade those problems and if possible fix them.

    And then of course you have the whole Sirius Black thing which, let's be honest, was just Eliezer trolling the readers.

    If the world isn't actually exploited, then just mentioning it wouldn't be enough to push it to the deconstruction side. I'd say it's a partial reconstruction, which is self aware about the canon that it could not fix. Which makes sense, given that's likely exactly what the motivation was.
    ```

- u/Sparkwitch:

  Yeah, that's my read. A deconstruction preserves worldbuilding and loses the plot, the theme, and the tone. A reconstruction abandons worldbuilding in order to preserve the plot, theme, and tone.

  I'd go so far as to propose that most *fanfiction* is either:
  - reconstruction where the worldbuilding is warped in order to match whatever the fanfic author wishes the story had focused on while preserving whatever they liked about the original work.
  - deconstruction where the plot, theme, and tone are warped in order to lampoon whatever the fanfic author was exasperated by in the original work.
  - or both! Season to taste.

  So Rational Fanfic either devotes itself to adjusting the worldbuilding for logical consistency, or using logically inconsistent worldbuilding to munchkin varying degrees of omniscience.

    I don't think the reconstruction abandons worldbuilding, it re-organises the world so that the worldbuilding rationally results in something close (ie thematically comparable) to the original intention, taking full advantage of the lessons learned from the deconstruction.

    I suggest that Pokemon OoS is a reconstruction, since it is about kids adventuring in dangerous wilds and training elemental horrors to battle one another as was the original game, but benefits from prior deconstructions that described the world as one featuring cockfighting for profit, Team Rocket terrorism, and post-apocalyptic survival.

  It's an interesting way of framing it ... but I'm not sure how correct it is.

  My quibble is mostly with how "Effect" and "Cause" are defined. For my example? A romantic comedy.

  In the romantic comedy, man chases after girl, does some sketchy stuff to win her over, she eventually finds out and gets mad, and then he wins her over again with his love, they kiss, end of movie.

  In the deconstruction, all the warped power dynamics, unhealthy attachment, pressure and expectations, etc. are all laid out. If we're excoriating the male lead, then the female lead probably says something like, "No, you don't get to fuck me just because you put in a lot of effort, and I'm not obligated to forgive you just because you made some grand gesture". All that's pretty standard fare for deconstruction, and I would generally agree that you can reasonably model it as "keep effect the same, change cause".

  *But* we can do a deconstruction in a *different* way, where neither cause nor effect actually changes, at least on the surface. Instead, we get a better psychological model of the man and woman, they ways in which they're damaged, and what causes them to respond to things in the way that they do. Where the original doesn't call out the behavior as unhealthy, the deconstruction definitely does, in ways that are explicit or implicit. The grand gestures of the male lead are revealed to be because those are easier than consistently being a good person. The acceptance of the female lead is from the gaslighting and internal feelings of worthlessness, with a smidgen of cultural conditioning layered on top of this. It's not depicted as a healthy relationship, but the plot beats are the same, and the outcomes are the same, they've only changed the *framing*. Really, what we've done is changed the worldbuilding, the "cause" rather than the effect. It's still not a reconstruction though, because its aim is to break down the original into its component parts and show all the ways that it's ugly and problematic.

  Similarly, there are different methods of reconstruction. What's important is not so much whether we're meddling with cause and effect, it's whether we're preserving the heart of the work or attacking it. You can do reconstruction that attempts to fix all the problems in the worldbuilding to achieve the same result (cause alteration), or you can take the stated rules to their limits and get something wildly different (effect alteration) ... and still have both of those sing to the same tune of the original.
  ```

    ```
    If we redefine cause = worldbuilding and effect = the heart of the work, then does this analysis match your conception of these terms? It seems completely reasonable to put in instead of what I wrote.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Hrm. I think I would actually just call them two different axes? But it's close.

      [Deconstruction <---> Reconstruction] would be our "disposition toward heart of the work" axis, while [Cause Alteration <---> Effect Alteration] would be a separate but related axis. (Note that neither of these are actually axes, because there are obvious hybrid approaches; the most common sort of reconstruction spends its first half as a deconstruction.)

      So we'd have four elemental subtypes ...

      **Cause Alteration Deconstruction:** Changes the base parameters of the work in order to criticize the original. Seems like it would generally be pretty weak deconstruction, and would likely get called out as character assassination, because it's not founded on the principles of the work. Probably strongest when it's showing us inside the head of someone we're not canonically in the head of, showing how a villain is the hero of his own story, or how the hero is impurely motivated.

      **Effect Alteration Deconstruction:** *Much* more common, and much easier, because the stage has been set for you, and all that remains is to take it in a different (typically darker) direction, showing how it would "really" be.

      **Cause Alteration Reconstruction:** The original has people make dumb decisions for dumb reasons, forget about their powers, etc, and the easiest way to fix these things is to give justifications for them in one way or another, reconciling the magic system or standardizing the superpowers or whatever. On the character side, this is usually the fan wank explanations for why some obvious plot hole isn't *actually* a plot hole.

      **Effect Alteration Reconstruction:** Less common, in my experience. Basically, you see a place where the characters act out of character, or the established rules are violated for no clear reason, and you decide that you're going to keep to those rules, *while* adhering as closely as possible to the spirit of the work.

      I would definitely agree that the two styles are each closely aligned with an approach, which is why I would call it a quibble.

    Yes, I agree with this. Where the "cause" is the world building (aka: the state of the world at the beginning of the story) and the "effect" is the result of this world and how it evolves (aka: the plot), to every narrative there's always a third element: the presentation. Which in-world isn't something tangible, but it has to do with how the events are framed and presented to us. You could use the same exact dialogue, and with different narrative cues, make the same scene feel neutral, or threatening, or funny. The "headspace" of the characters especially is completely inaccessible to them (unless telepathy is involved), but it's bared in front of the readers if so the author wishes.

  I myself enjoy grimdark when it's done well, not when it's too forced or edgy just to be dark.
