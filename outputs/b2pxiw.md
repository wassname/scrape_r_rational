## My gripes with the Genre.

### Post:

Let me preface by saying that I love Mother of Learning and hate how so many fantasy characters abilities seem to fluctuate on a daily basis. Cough* Harry Potter *Cough. 

I stumbled across this sub thinking this sort of stuff was just what I was looking for. I have really not been able to get into, are my gripes justified? Is Rational Fiction just not the genre for me? or am I missing some key part of it?

I've read at decent chunk of a few different 'Rational Fictions' but will be focusing on HPMOR and Pokemon Origin of Species to highlight my complaints. 
I feel both novels have a great premise, excellent ideas/world-building in the fantasy world they are based in and interesting plot points. 

So my main complaints are about the MCs, they both start the fiction around 11/12 years old and I understand them being smart are part of the novelisation but they spend their entire time spouting logical fallacies and /r/iamverysmart-esque dialogue. They are both obsessed with their little list of how to conduct a proper experiment that those stupid adults haven't thought of. 

There doesn't seem to be any growth, I felt as i grew up I realised how little I actually knew and saying occam's razor doesn't make you a genius. But they barrel ahead and the only setbacks seem to be them being over confident and they need to go back to their rules that they carelessly disregarded. By the time they are 13 they have already overthrown hundreds of years of magical theory because no-one knows how to conduct proper experiments. It just feels like fan-fiction for 15 year olds. 


Any recommendations more like Mother of Learning?

  Check out Worth the Candle. Its protagonist is a complicated and not-very-nice person who undergoes a hell of a lot of growth, none of which changes the fact that he's a pretty shitty guy--but he absolutely learns and grows from his (frequent, and frequently serious) mistakes.

      It's also nice how Worth the Candle takes the effort to give in-story reasons for why things are the way they are - worldbuilding that initially seem exploitable or absurd turn out to not work the way the protagonists think they do. The protagonist does have super special protagonist powers, but there's an actual reason for them and there's quite a bit of existential horror to go around as the cast digs into what they actually entail.

    Juniper's a pretty shitty guy? I know he's not ideal and he makes mistakes but (despite his own opinions) I don't find him to be that shitty of a person. 

    There could be a lot of bias here though, since we read the story from his perspective primarily
    ```

    - u/Frankenlich:
      ```
      Seriously! If anything the first person perspective makes him look worse, not better, because he's incredibly self-conscious of his morality.

      By his own admission, Juniper was a horrible shitbag back on Earth. He stabs his best friend Arthur in the back by stealing his crush, Tiff, and doesn't even have the common decency to tell him. When Arthur dies, Joon goes into a self-destructive spiral where he alienates all his other friends. He makes up grimdark, hopeless, edgelord campaigns, and inflicts them on his friends because he is angry at the world. He gets into a fight with Reimer over his relationship with Tiff, then gets back at him by killing his character 8 times in one session. He abandons Tiff when she needs him the most, because his depressed ass doesn't feel like he deserves to be happy. He assaults Victor Clark over a sympathetic platitude and gets arrested for it. He fucks Craig's 15-year-old sister, Maddie, whom he doesn't even like, and again keeps it secret until Craig confronts him. He _tries to kill himself_; how do you think his parents would have felt about their high schooler doing that?

      To a large extent, _Worth the Candle_ is the story of Juniper learning to be a better person. There's a _reason_ why he is being forced to confront his inner demons come to life on Aerb.

        Many points here are valid but i dont think you can steal a crush. Arthur had no special right to Tiff and he should have approached her if he wanted to go out with her. Tiff can make her own choices.

        I also dont think you can blame the depressed person for trying to kill themselves. Depression is called a mental illness for a reason and most people who try to kill themselves certainly are not doing it out some type of malice. Often they think their relatives and friends would fare better with out them.
        ```

        - u/LordSwedish:
          ```
          The issue isn't that he knew his best friend was into her and then started dating her. He knew it would hurt Arthur and rather than try to talk to him about it before things escalated he decided it would be better to keep it a secret. Sometimes people do things that's hurtful to other people even though that's not your intent and that's part of life, what makes Joon an asshole is continuing to do it and lying about it. That's a betrayal.
          ```

          - u/Timewinders:
            ```
            Agreed. People, including characters in the story like Joon, act like that is a valid justification for Joon's actions, hiding being social justice when it's barely relevant here. No one was claiming that Tiff 'belonged' to Arthur and shouldn't have a choice. No one is blaming Tiff for doing anything wrong.

            The problem was that Joon basically betrayed his best friend by going behind his back to secretly ask out his crush despite being aware of Arthur's feelings. He essentially chose having Tiff as a girlfriend over the best friend who had been loyal to him for years. Despite knowing the harm it would do to his friendship with Arthur he still did it because he didnt value Arthur's friendship as much as Tiff. This made explicitly clear by his values screen which shows Tiff above Arthur.

            Even worse, he went behind Arthur's back instead of being honest with his best friend. Their relationship made a complete mockery of Arthur's feelings instead of letting him move on. Joons asshole friend was right about that, despite the rude way he said it.

            I face palmed when the author then made Arthur into a molester later on. Basically just an excuse to make Arthur less sympathetic by exaggerating the flaws he had on Earth.

            Considering that Aerb probably exists to fulfill Joon's fantasies, this is especially suspect. So if it turns out that it really was just to assuage Joons guilt then that would actually be interesting writing.

              Eh, I'd argue that Aerb is more of a dark version of wish fulfilment. He gets his world where he can be a badass super warrior but just like real life it has really shitty implications and when you live your desires it turns out you don't actually want it or don't want to want it.

              Joon wants his best friend back and wants to feel less guilty about what he did, so he finds himself in a world where those things work together in a way that really just makes Joon more unhappy.

              - u/Timewinders:
                ```
                It's hard to say so far. I think it depends on how the ending plays out as to whether it ends up staying as a dark type of wish fulfillment or ends up as just regular wish fulfillment played straight. Or with the wish fulfillment parts of Aerb fading (i.e. all of Joon's harem no longer interested in him anymore, Arthur is confirmed dead at the end, etc. ) but Joon manages to improve on his flaws and be at peace with himself despite not getting that wish fulfillment any more, and works towards building a happy life in ways that don't involve dwelling on the past.

        I understand what you're saying but that all occurs in the time before Juniper arrives on Aerb. I'm saying the June we encounter from the beginning of the story onwards doesn't seem like a shitty person. He makes mistakes and incorrect choices, as anyone would, but he does seem to do pretty well at being an ok human being for the vast majority of WtC. He definitely has his flaws; I just don't think he qualifies as a "shitty person" during the story.

    I enjoy the series but it has a lot of the same problems.

    The only people I have ever heard have dialogue remotely close to anything like these teens from Kansas are extremely few and sometimes still not at their level.

    What I'm saying is the teenage dialogue is completely off putting to me. I was friends with a few philosophy Phds while I was in undergrad and they are the only people who came remotely close to the vocab and rhetorical analysys that these 12-17 year old kids from Kansas had. It took a lot of effort to look past. 

    Overall it's a good read but for definitly has a lot of flaws that I have to actively ignore and look past to enjoy

      Author here! A lot of how people talk is based on e-mails, blog posts I wrote for my GeoCities website, or a memoir that I started and never finished in my senior year of high school. Here's a relatively impersonal (and hopefully representative) sample:

      > Two years ago, before we were dating, I threw one of my parties. Claire wasn't, at the time, a good friend. She was, however, friends with the people that I invited. Because the general rule was that anyone could invite anyone else, turnout was usually good.  We would play strip poker and truth or dare, all of us seeing how far other people would go. If we could have just shed the indecision and self-doubt, it would have been an orgy. 

      > That sort of thing only happened upstairs. Downstairs was a place to watch movies and play videogames. It also served a dual purpose as the base for our illegal activities. Now that fireworks are legal and we don't have a curfew, those sorts of things seem so mundane. Back then, the thrill of doing something that might get us in trouble was all the incentive we needed.

      > Before my dad installed the screens, there were two windows on the second floor that led out onto the roof of the porch.  It had little slope, so we would climb out there and flash the traffic that went by on the highway. When that got boring, the people who partied hard would go inside and find more hell to raise, while the more tame people and myself sat out on the roof and talked. Claire was one of them.

      > The best memory that I got from there, the most important one from that particular gathering, came on that roof. Claire was sitting next  to me, about a foot from the edge. It was four or five in the morning and Joey had just thrown a full can of pop at a passing semi. I moved a bit further away from the house and towards the drop off, when Claire grabbed my arm and told me that it scared her when I went that close. As far as I can remember, that's the first time that she had touched me.

      I see this as being obnoxious to read (in several ways) and I would do a lot of editing to it, but in terms of vocabulary I don't think that it's that far off from what's presented in the text. (As far as knowledge goes, I've gotten the complaint that too many of the discussions are surface level regurgitations of various topics, which seems like a more correct complaint to me?)

      That said, I certainly don't think that *Worth the Candle* is without its flaws, and if this is one of them, I think it's an acceptable break from reality to keep conversations more interesting to read. Sorry if you find it off-putting.

      I don't know, I don't buy the dialogue from an 11 year old. But I don't think my vocabulary got significantly more sophisticated in the half decade since I was in high school.

      And at a certain point, we do make allowances for the medium and for readable dialogue. If I'm going to read a Harry Potter story, it shouldn't be to the same extent as HPMOR, but I'd rather that the characters sound like they're 13 or 15 than 11. But I don't feel like the dialogue in WtC is significantly out of place, and we don't actually ever see 9-year-old Juniper dialogue IIRC.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        FWIW, the chronologically youngest dialogue in WtC is when Juniper is 10 years old, which lasts for a single scene, and there I *did* make an effort to make sure that the vocabulary/syntax was toned way down, with the exception of some words that are the kind you could pick up from reading YA fantasy. (e.g. "tome", "repent", etc.) That's chapter 83, ctrl+F "the necromancer". YMMV on whether it works well or not.

        ```
        > I'm so confused. Juniper *really* isn't a particularly bad person... Like at all. 

        I think the confusion you're experiencing is because Juniper isn't usually acting with the *intention* of doing bad things. He's not a psychopath who derives pleasure from harming others. But a number of his actions are selfish and/or thoughtless and end up hurting others.  He's like a lot of teenagers I've known - someone who acts without thinking through the consequences and winds up causing harm. As those teenagers matured and became adults, a lot of them would look back at their behavior as teens and go "Damn, I was a real prick." Juniper is not quite at that point, but he's moving toward it, IMO.

        Examples of how he's been a bad person would include how he used Maddie, pushed his friends away, abandoned that nameless girl at the beginning of the story, the way he originally treated Grak, things he'd say that hurt/upset Fenn, etc. His goal wasn't to hurt other people for most of these, but the result of his actions were that people got hurt.
        ```

        - u/Frankenlich:
          ```
          Right, but all of that actually points to him being quite a decent person... bad people don't tend to give a shit when they hurt people. That's what, in my opinion at least, defines a "bad person". 

          Also, I'm fairly willing to forgive shitty things a grieving 17 year old does that don't have lasting negative consequences, like treating a sex partner callously. 

          >He's like a lot of teenagers I've known - someone who acts without thinking through the consequences and winds up causing harm

          I mean... I think Juniper is WAAAAAY more introspective and forward thinking than most teenagers :P

              And here's Joon's sentiments on their relationship before he was dumped:
              > Despite that, I was determined that I was going to make it work somehow, because if Maddie liked me, and I was her boyfriend, then I wasn’t going to bow out at the first sign of trouble.

            If you really think about it, is is really better if he's sorry about it? Sure he's been getting better, but let's narrow it down to his character in the first parts of the story. If you hurt people, feel bad about it, and then continue to hurt people...how is that better than not caring about it in the current situation? 

            A person who is so consumed by their toxic behaviour that they can't stop hurting people despite what they actually want might be more sympathetic, but it doesn't make them less of a "bad person" just because they mope about hurting people.

        > Are there any characterization guidelines to avoiding the Eight Deadly Words?

        I'd say it's really subjective, depends on the reader. You'll never get everyone. IMHO the key is none of these things - it has to be someone that's *interesting*. It can be interesting because you feel like they're a nice person and want them to succeed. It can be that they have a peculiar set of belief and you enjoy discovering them. Or they can even be fully villainous, but still be *fun*, because of how extraordinary their villainy is.

        For me the least interesting character is one that is mediocre in all aspects. I made the example of Breaking Bad above, because it had this effect on me. Walter White isn't especially stupid, but he's not especially smart either. He keeps fucking up and that sets back his plans, which makes his progression frustrating. But he's also obviously pretty selfish, yet he rationalizes his selfishness and evil with pretty standard excuses. He's not interesting. He's the most annoying kind of real human being, one that's everywhere and that is more often than not a thorn in our side. An egotistical asshole that doesn't even have the decency of embracing fully evil and being honest about it. So, personally, I lost interest in his story. The same can happen for example with a good character who however is too incompetent to achieve anything of significance. One or two mistakes are fine, but if they keep fucking up, you end up losing any belief that they *deserve* success.

  There are a good number of works that are often recommended here that I think would fit what you're looking for (Consistent worldbuilding, consistent powers/abilities, no lectures).

  Of those, the one I'm most familiar with is [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/2011/06/11/1-1/), which I highly recommend.  It's a superhero/supervillain story with interesting powers that have consistent limitations (so the exact opposite of The Flash).  Even seemingly simple powers like enhanced strength or durability have clever nuances that allow the users to get creative with them in believable ways. 

  Unlike rational fiction, the main character is not being set up by the author as someone who the reader should emulate.  She's a complicated character making hard decisions, and those decisions aren't always the right one.  There's a whole "road to hell paved with good intentions" thing going on.

    I've seen Worm recommended a fair amount before but never got round to looking at it. I'll give it a go thanks. 

    I was thinking of mentioning the Flash tv show as an example, it is absolutely terrible for it. I find it hard to imagine a problem that can't be solved with super speed but he manages to get beaten by a guy with a cold gun. While like 5 times per episode the bad guy manages to run away from him and he is just like 'oh well maybe next time'.

      Speaking of the exact opposite of The Flash, let me plug Flicker from the [Fall of Doc Future](http://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/82363551272/fall-of-doc-future-contents) novel series.  If you want to read about a super-speed character who both understands and obeys the laws of general relativity, that's best-in-class. It will, unfortunately, ruin all super-speedster stories for you in the future, but if you're as frustrated by The Flash's TV show as I am, it's probably too late for that.

      It does have similar problems with over-smart protagonists, but they're not kids.  The characters don't run /r/iamverysmart "proper" experiments on-screen, but that's more because they've already figured out their powers off-screen in non-emergency situations, like any reasonable person would.

      If you're going to read Worm, I'd also strongly suggest listening to the [We've Got Worm](https://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-worm/) podcast after you finish each arc. I found it incredibly hard to put down the serial and really process all of the details in the story, but the guys on the podcast do an excellent job of recapping each arc, diving into the significant character moments and interactions, and coming at the work from a literary perspective rather than a rationalist one. Too often I think that we in this community get caught up in a kind of obsessive power optimization mindset, and getting to see a story you love from a lens you've never considered is pretty damn awesome.

          One of the main events that effects Ward's main character's personality and actions happens in Worm, and due to how traumitizing it was she doesn't really think about it in depth, preferring to kind of skirt around it.

  I would prefer fewer of the /r/iamverysmart references. That subreddit feels toxic and much too easily applied to anything resembling insufficiently humble intellectual activity; it's a force that serves primarily to make it socially costly to say intelligent things or speak honestly about thinking. It's a trope I consider to be unusually destructive, and I'd rather it not start infecting conversations that it doesn't have to.

  When you have a criticism of what these protagonists are saying, you'd be better off putting it in words.

  I'm noticing myself feeling somewhat defensive, so take this comment with a handful of salt, but since you explicitly bring up my story and then ask whether your gripes are justified or if you're missing some key part of it, I'm going to try to respond respectfully and see if there is in fact something you're missing.

  >but they spend their entire time spouting logical fallacies and /r/iamverysmart-esque dialogue. 

  So if you actually go to the sub, you see a bunch of people talking about how smart they are, or putting down others for being dumb, or bragging about accomplishments, or just assertions of being extraordinary. Hence the title of the subreddit.

  But I can't really remember Red doing this at any point. Can you point to any? He does use big words and talk about intellectual topics, yes, and he does bring up logical fallacies, but those seem like a strange thing to be upset about. In any case if you just don't find any value in that, then you're probably looking more for rational stories than rational*ist* stories.

  >They are both obsessed with their little list of how to conduct a proper experiment that those stupid adults haven't thought of.

  Can you point to instances of this obsession for Red? The few times he's questioned whether adults have thought of some experiment he rather quickly realized he was wrong, with the exception of when he had access to technology others haven't had yet.

  >There doesn't seem to be any growth, I felt as i grew up I realised how little I actually knew and saying occam's razor doesn't make you a genius. 

  What chapter did you stop reading at? I don't know where the reasonable expectation of character growth is supposed to be in a story, maybe you're expecting them to overcome their flaws by 5 or 10 chapters in, but unless I know how far into the story you've gotten it's hard to point out what you might have missed.

  >But they barrel ahead and the only setbacks seem to be them being over confident and they need to go back to their rules that they carelessly disregarded. 

  Can you name some instances of Red doing this?

  >By the time they are 13 they have already overthrown hundreds of years of magical theory because no-one knows how to conduct proper experiments. It just feels like fan-fiction for 15 year olds.

  Well neither Harry or Red ever reach age 13 in-story, so I'm assuming this is a hypothetical, but you seem to be upset here that protagonists in a story might be able to accomplish something extraordinary because basically everyone else is dumb. Which would be fair if that's what actually happens, but in HPMOR the reason Harry is able to make unique discoveries is that he's the only wizard who was taught the scientific method or is well versed in scientific discoveries *at all,* while in OOS Red has an enormous amount of help from his mentors, one of whom is the foremost pokemon researcher in the Region and world, and still only manages to make a single, relatively minor discovery after 66 chapters.

  Also, it's worth noting they're fanfic of stories where many things *weren't* discovered or *don't* make sense that try to explain why. If it feels like fanfiction for 15 year olds, then I'm assuming you're asserting that by the age of 15 you noticed all these nonsensical things in Harry Potter and Pokemon and already came up with better explanations for why they work that way? If not, I think you rather have missed the point of them, yes.

    I feel the OP here is acting upon a bit of a strawman, the character he describes acts in ways that the characters in the story don't act. 

    For starters, the characters tend not to do things simply to _appear_ smart, but do things because of genuine motivations. They use those long words because they make sense or, maybe at worst they don't want to dumb something down and there could be an element of arrogance to that sure, but their motivations are genuine and unrelated to wanting to appear smart, making them well safe from iamverysmart territory.

    Hi Daystar! First of all, I love your story and your podcast. That being said, I want to try to offer some constructive criticism here. 

    No matter how well he's written, it's a fact that there *will* be people who don't like Red's personality. That being said, these people can still love the story. I would argue one of the greatest strengths of OOS is that it has an ensemble cast with depth. OOS really has three protagonists and you seem like you could pass an ideological turing test for all three of them.

    However, this isn't really conveyed at the beginning of the story. I feel like the beginning sets the story up as being about mostly about Red, which could turn off readers who don't like Red very much. I would suggest, if you have the time, rewriting the beginning of the story to better reflect the content of the rest of OOS.

    (Disclaimer: You mentioned in your podcast that you've rewritten the beginning before and I'm not sure which iteration was the one I read, so for all I know, you've already done all this.)

    Thank you for reading this and I look foreward to reading your next chapter!

      Thanks for the feedback! Yeah, I definitely thought about bringing in Blue or Leaf's perspectives earlier in the story when I first wrote it. The problem was that neither felt like they had anything particularly important to say (thought/perspective wise) until the forest fire.   


      I definitely could see arguments for having the forest fire occur earlier in the story, rather than waiting until 15. For example there are a couple chapters, like 8-9, that I can probably cut down and combine without losing much from the plot. But I like the world building and character moments they provide, and would have to have a lot more free time to go back and better streamline the story to get to the other characters' perspectives faster, or come up with good reasons to get into their heads earlier.

  Practical Guide to Evil is a solid pick in terms of character growth and not falling into the IAVS trap. It's not a time loop story like MoL, but it shares the characteristics of being set in an original fantasy world and of the protagonist becoming steadily more competent and skilled.

  "Rational" stories often forget that the base state of a human being is a jumble of emotions that our logical brains very often try to make sense of, but often fail.

  "Rational" characters with logical streams of thought even in times of extreme stress, the types that never ever get angry or show emotion etc. are the furthest thing from a "human" being.

  Imo there's 3 levels of rationality in stories -

  1. Completely irrational, neither world nor characters make sense and there's no consistency.

  2. I-am-very-rational type stories, where the protagonists are either semi-human robots or author mouthpieces. Worldbuilding will often be pretty good but might not stand up to *too* much scrutiny (your example of the 12 year old solving science's greatest mysteries).

  3. Actual rational stories, where the protagonists are proper humans with all the irrationality that follows with it, who are not prisoners of the plot, have their own unique "voice" and show a varied range of emotions. These stories often have the protagonist making the best of situations they land in, and not necessarily solving all the world's mysteries/problems. The character's rationality is dictated by the world they live in, not our own (the rational thing to do in a world where guns are the main weapon vs when there's one or more of many different types of magic is completely different).

      Personally I find most of the characters in Mother of Learning disturbingly unemotional, Zorian most of all. Some, like Zach or Taivan are more expressive, but I'm struggling to think of any situation where a major character does something of consequence because they are in that moment angry, sad, scared, or even happy. The closest I can think of is Zorian's simulacrum indulging Kirielle, and Zorian spends the remainder of the chapter complaining about that, IIRC.

      On the second point, the biggest offender I can think of is A Hero's War. It's better than a 12-year old science hero, but being a MatSci grad student does not make you a one-man industrial revolution capable of re-inventing a good chunk of modern engineering using a mostly new, magic-based system of physics.

      - u/alexshpilkin:
        ```
        I don’t know, I think Zorian spends the early part of MoL being a pretty believable arse to his relatives and... everyone else, really, and then spends a reasonable chunk of time running around in anguish while expecting Red Robe to appear. The end result of his emotional development is what I find the weakest—I understand why he’d end up as this incredibly grounded person given he survived the time loop, but that shouldn’t feel like an absence of emotional reactions from the inside, and that’s how his perspective looks like in the recent chapters. But I don’t think it’s fair to say there’s no emotional development at all.

        This is somewhat obscured by the glacial pace of the releases, I think. (Glacial in comparison to my reading speed, not in comparison to any hypothetical ideal writing speed.) At least for me the development is much clearer on a reread. It’s difficult to keep track of subtle large-scale undercurrents when you can and do read several complete books or serials in the time between the chapters.

        Haven't read Hero's War yet, so can't speak on that one, but good point on MoL, characterization is definitely its weakest feature for me and this is a large reason why. Zorian often feels like a robot whose only emotion is annoyance, with maybe occasional mild awkwardness or envy. It's also not explicitly a rational story, but I won't No True Scotsman it since it's very popular on this sub.

    \#1 & \#2 are absolutely the most common type on this sub. It's basically a coin flip, but sometimes the coin lands sideways and you end up with Worm, PGTE, MoL, or WtC.

    I enjoyed HPMOR after some getting used to: The idea of long intelligent fiction was extremely exciting to me. I got over the mouthpiecing and 'obviously not a 12 year old', but it feels like the author never got over the 'big words, philosophy = intelligence' stage that lots of teenagers go through.

    I really _really_ wanted to enjoy Pokemon: OoS, but I just couldn't. Pokemon Game of Champions (not really 'rational', but worldbuilding + character voice were best-in-class) left too big of an imprint on my idea of what a fanfic could be that I got my hopes up. Characters just felt weird, all the scientific explanations felt so forced, I just had to drop it. I'd like to go into more detail, but it was a long time ago and I don't want to say anything incorrect about it. I'd try it again if it got better, I only made it to chapter 10 or so. I don't mean to imply this or HPMOR are bad, but I just wasn't into them.

    If a better sub existed for good webnovels, rational or not, I would be very interested. Sadly, this seems to be the best community for it, with all the pros and cons that brings.

      The big words, philosophy = intelligence trope is only relevant when what they're saying isn't that intelligent after all and the motivation of the speaker is to use them in order to _appear_ smart, instead of actually being smart. I never got the impression from Harry in HPMOR that his motivation was to _appear_ smart, instead it was to get from where we currently are to the relevant solution as fast as humanly possible, what people think of him be damned. It's what I liked about it so much.

Being intended as the one doesn't preclude being also intended as the other.

        > you're over 4 years behind on where the story/characters/quality of the story is now. 

        I see this defense (for whatever story, not picking on you specifically) come up every now and then but I think it misses the fact that _you're still forced to read through countless chapters of poor quality writing_. Considering how pretty much none of the stories posted here have proper editors who'd fix more than typoes / grammar (and mostly not even that!), even the "good parts" are rarely _that_ great.

        "Yes, the story starts out crap but after 300k words it gets pretty ok" is usually much closer to the truth. Now how attractive does that actually sound if you look at it from an outsider perspective?
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          You're begging the question a bit. Of course when you put it that way there's no way to disagree with your perfectly reasonable point that reading "countless chapters of poor quality writing" is a bad idea.

          But the truth is it's often a continuum and everyone has their own thresholds. Some people won't read a story unless it starts golden. Some people are willing to give a story a chance to get its legs. Everyone should feel entitled to putting a story down whenever they feel like it's not worth further investment, but that's not the same thing as judging a story by its beginning, which is what I wanted to make sure the person I responded to wasn't doing.

          Anyone who actually reads 300k words of a story to get to what they'd just consider "pretty ok" has got way more free time than I do, and I doubt they'd stick around a subreddit like this for long.
          ```

          - u/SkoomaDentist:
            ```
            The point is that if the story hasn't reasonably gotten its legs by chapter 10 the author has already failed. A story can always improve later of course but if the first 10 chapters are bad, it's a sign that the story taken as a whole _still_ fails. I see little reason to excuse such stories when the publishing medium inherently allows re-editing / rewriting the start once the author has "found their voice". If the authors are not willing to do that, the readers or reviewers are in no way obligated to give them any slack either.

            TL;DR: Having a story take one or two chapters to get going is fine. Not managing that in 10 chapters is a sign of poor writing.

            - u/InfernoVulpix:
              ```
              You make rewrites of beginning chapters sound like a very normalized thing for online serial fiction, and I can't help but disagree.  The only times I can remember an author going back and rewriting the first few chapters is when the story was already finished and they're doing a full editing pass or the first chapters were *extremely* bad, and neither case is very common, even among works that I believe do have talented and dedicated authors.

              It'd be fair to make the argument that these things *should* happen more often than they do, I believe, but it sounds like you are expecting it from authors like it's already the standard and deviation from it is a sign of excessive laziness or lack of investment, which feels pretty rude and disrespectful.

            - u/DaystarEld:
              ```
              "Poor writing" is a strong charge to make on such a subjective issue as reader engagement. I personally found the first chapters of HPMOR rough around the edges, but still riveting. I know others that couldn't get past them until I rewrote them, and then loved them and the rest of the story. Clearly I was able to "improve" the writing for those chapters for those people, but each person's threshold and taste is different, and for others they might have just been adding fluff to a perfectly streamlined intro.

              As I said, I think you're perfectly within your rights to decide how to spend your own reading time and use that metric. I just know that if I felt the same way, I would have missed out on a ton of stories that I really love, not just web serials but published book series like The Dresden Files and web comics like Gunnerkrigg Court.

              And yes, on a personal note if I had more free time and was just a better writer maybe I could make my first 10 chapters more riveting to more readers. But as a general cost-benefit analysis, working on new chapters seems better than rewriting things from 4+ years ago as long as I'm still getting a decent amount of new readers every month, which I am.

              How many authors actually do this? The first few chapters of HPMoR and MoL, for instance, are both substantially lower quality than the rest of the story. It's even worse for webcomics, the first few _books_ of OotS, DrMcNinja and Schlock Mercenary are all substantially lower quality than the rest of the work and yet those authors also don't go back and redo their old work.

              _Worth the Candle_ is good from the beginning has none of those things, although it _is_ a deconstruction of [Isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai), an anime/manga/light novel genre. On the other hand, Isekai is just the Eastern version of [portal fantasy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrappedInAnotherWorld), so if you are familiar with Western examples (_Oz_, _Narnia_, etc...) you should know enough to understand the serial.

        Thanks for the reply! I think I'll give it another shot over the next week.

        This is all subjective, of course:
        I do believe HPMOR was intelligently written, don't get me wrong on that. Likely one of the smartest fictions I've ever read. The problem, at least to me, was that it seemed to make every other character an idiot (apart from voldemort) if they didn't use formally defined ('big words') logic. In my experience, most people are entirely familiar with, and naturally use, logical concepts such as explained in the book, such as basic Bayesian statistics or proofs. It's been too long and I'm at work at the moment, so I can't pull better examples. It's always useful to put a word to the concept, but the story (or at least HPJEV) treated them as if they were one and the same. Like, if a character didn't know what Baye's theorem was, they just wouldn't have been able to do the math to calculate a result, despite it being fairly intuitive even without knowing of it.
        I could be entirely misremembering this, and if so, don't go through too much effort to prove me wrong, I'll take your word for it pretty easily.
        Obviously Harry isn't supposed to be a super lovable protagonist, and I can't put all the blame on Yudkowsky as a person, but my feelings were that I was getting some authorial ego on top of the protagonists.

        I have read till the end of the cruise ship plot and I had to literally decide that in my headcannon that the planet your story is set in takes 25% longer to rotate around its sun. Twelve year old humans don't have mature enough brains for neither the rationality nor even the specific type of irrationality that your protagonists display. No matter what kind of social conventions exist in your world. So aging them up to being biologically equivalent to 15 year olds was the only way to repair my suspension of disbelief.

        And yet I still haven't gotten back to reading your first >!Endbringer arc!<.

          &#x200B;

          This is a pretty strong claim. What's your sample size for it? If you're randomly selecting 12 year olds from the entire human population, then yeah you're right, but then I'd probably extend that to average *twenty* year olds. But if you've never met a gifted 12 year old (and I mean that in the sense beyond "was in gifted classes in school"), then your skepticism is understandable.

          The remaining discrepancy is answered in my FAQ:

          **Isn’t it unrealistic to have Red, Blue and Leaf so intelligent/mature for 11-12 year olds?**

          I’m actually of two minds on this. On the one hand, I’m perfectly fine saying that environmental pressures have made humans in the pokemon world a standard deviation more mature and intelligent than they would be in our world… any kids that didn’t treat pokemon like the deadly monsters they are would not have survived the dark ages before pokeballs were invented.

          On the other hand, I honestly do believe that many kids, even in our world, are [more adult-like than most people give them credit for.](https://medium.com/@ThingMaker/educ-101-axioms-f1cba0c85794) I especially believe that almost all kids, when raised in certain circumstances, can grow to be as mature as their environment dictates. There are child soldiers in war torn countries that are forced to fight at the age Red and Blue and Leaf are. Throughout history, boys in particularly military cultures have been trained to fight and kill since pre-adolescence.

          Whether these are the healthiest or best ways to raise children is obviously a different question. But when humanity’s survival relies on training children to be soldiers, they’re sure as hell going to be more mature than the average 21st century western 11 year old.

          As for intelligence, Red, Blue and Leaf are all gifted youngsters, even among their peers. Perhaps that doesn’t account for ALL their intelligence, but I work with kids, and every once in awhile I’ll meet an 11 or 12 year old who’s as intelligent and well spoken as their older siblings and parents. They’re not typical kids, but to me they’re realistic enough… and they’re not even [producing nuclear fusion in their garage at the age of 14.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Wilson)

            Out of curiosity, why didn't you just rewrite the scenario so that Pokemon trainers start their journeys at 18 instead of 11? It seems to me that the reason Pokemon trainers start at 11 in canon is because Game Freak wanted to sell the games to 11 year olds, not because it makes sense in context.

            Even given the setting of Origin of Species, I could see children beginning their formal training on handling and battling Pokemon at age 11 and even being pressed into emergency service when a Stormbringer attacks, but it still seems like it'd be more sensible to restrict independent journeying until 18.

            I suppose the flip side is that societies only really invest in that kind of controlled environment learning for their children when they are rich, stable, and have industry developed enough that the extra skill acquired in further education can be put to good use. If the setting of OoS is meant to imply that general life expectancy is too short to afford that kind of investment, it might make sense to end formal schooling/training by 10-11 and let gifted students find further tutelage in Gyms.

              To be honest with you, I didn't even consider it. It's the step a lot of fanfiction takes, including the main one I really enjoyed, like Game of Champions. But I grew up loving a lot of fiction that put smart and/or mature kids in serious circumstances, not just modern YA fiction but classics like Tom Sawyer and A Wrinkle in Time and The Outsiders, and of course things like IT and Ender's Game and The Body, and I've just never really felt that thing that a lot of people seem to feel when they read a young character and think "there's no way kids that age are like that."

              I think modern society underestimates kids a hell of a lot. I think modern western society in particular sees kids as immature and helpless because that's how our children are raised. And I think so few people really remember what being a kid was like, or don't have a wide enough sample size for kids to understand that there are some who are really, really smart and mature.  And of course just like in most fiction that focuses on exceptional characters, fiction starring kids will likely include exceptional kids.

              And yes, I just don't think a world that takes Pokemon as seriously as I envision it can wait for kids to be 18 to have them help keep its roads and cities safe. Your idea is a good one, and I wouldn't look askance to any fanfic that put its kids through a lot more years of intensive training before sending them out. But if I'm going to have child soldiers in my fic, why not make them the canonical age, you know?

              It also helps that Pokemon is inherently different from so many other worlds when it comes to what \*power\* is. The characters themselves are basically just normal people, unless they're psychic. Their pokemon are the ones who have all the power. And what does it take to be a good trainer? Knowledge and reflexes.

              Sure, adults are stronger and more athletic than kids, but plenty of kids can throw and catch baseballs pretty well. But when it comes to knowledge, I mean shit, I knew all 151 pokemon and their moves and type interactions by the age of 11. Had no problem with the next 100 that were added either. And I'm not a genius like Red or Blue. Kids know \*a lot\* about the things they care about and obsess over. There's nothing that really stops an exceptional kid from being a powerful trainer except maybe time. If anything it's the most rational world for kids to become so powerful, except maybe those that use some video game or card game as the source of power.

                That's fair enough - I don't disagree that kids in the ~11-15 year old range can be as competent as adults in certain areas. For my own piece, I do think they tend to lack in emotional regulation and long-term, multi-factor conditional planning, but OoS addresses both of those.

                Red has been using his latent psychic abilities to compensate, Blue seems unusually but not extraordinarily good at it for his age, and Leaf's biggest blind spot often seems to be her inability to empathize with other people and understand their viewpoint. Blue is following a fairly linear path toward the League Championship, while Red and Leaf both struggle mightily to make decisions about how to balance their time and interests.

                Thanks for explicating your thoughts on it. I'm really interested to see how recent events in the fic affect the main characters outlook and emotional states.

            I never claimed they were too intelligent. Just too mature. And not only in the "ready to make sound decisions and take on what the world throws at them" sense of the world.

            The thing that gave my SoD the last kick was how the relationship between Red and Leaf was progressing, which had nothing to do with rationality and intelligence.

            But beyond that, none of your examples dissuade me. Afaik, most child soldiers are *not* mature, at least not in the emotional stability sense. And I don't know about their sexual maturity, but their maturity regarding genuine romantic love is probably also not advancing faster than usual.

            I mean sure. Maybe all three in your group are early bloomers on top of being child prodigies *and* people with increased empathic ability and moral understanding higher than ninetysomething percent of Earth humanity, but you must understand how that starts straining my SoB.

            Also, the kid you linked is already undergoing puberty. Have your three main characters already started on that path?

              When you say their brains aren't developed enough for rationality, I think it's fair to say that's a claim about their intelligence, but okay, so you're taking about emotional maturity and romantic maturity.

              For emotional maturity, Red's definitely got advantages over most 12 year olds, but I model his responses to things a lot off of some of my clients, particularly those in the 11-14 age range with high emotional intelligence and self awareness. None of them have been child soldiers, but most have lost parents or gone through other kinds of trauma, and all are obviously in therapy or have had therapy before, so if I see them capable of something, there's no reason not to make Red capable of it. He definitely has advantages with his intelligence and rationality, though, in articulating how and why he does something, and his psychic training also helps in modifying his own behavior rather than needing therapy as much.

              As for sexual maturity, or "genuine romantic love," I'm actually not sure what you're referring to? I have vivid memories of what having a crush at that age was like, and that's mostly what I'm drawing on. He's definitely smarter and wiser than I was at that age, but it's not like he's got advanced knowledge of what being in relationships are like, or experience dealing with heartache, or resolving disputes with someone he has feelings for.

  It seems a bit like a double standard. If the protagonists overcame challenges by being super strong physically nobody has a problem with that. Showing off brute force is socially acceptable and even admirable, but showing off intelligence is seen as obnoxious and arrogant.

  If a super buff person shows off their strength, nobody interprets that as them saying "hahaha I'm so strong and you're a total wimp!" 

  Yet if a super smart person shows off their intelligence, people take that as if it's an insult to them personally. That seems awfully prejudiced, no offense.

    It's not a double standard, because Harry in HPMOR isn't really all that brilliant.

It's just that the author makes what he does work because that's how the author thinks the world works; the protag's failings reflect the author's failings.

      I really don't get where people are getting this idea from. HPMOR is the story of Harry repeatedly getting his ass handed to him because he isn't nearly as smart as he thinks he is. 

      Learning some humility and accepting the difference between clever and smart are the very core of his character arc.

      I mean, yes, the character still very much has the world revolve around him and he has a much larger impact on the world than is realistic (a trait he shares with his canon counterpart btw), but him being overconfident is explicitly and repeatedly pointed out in the story.

        Yes, some of the things that he does that should fail do fail, but some of the things he does that should fail do not fail. Partial transfiguration worked on *basically* his first try, through the most hilariously ironic map and territory error. His patronus 2.0 just works similarly, as if no one ever would have thought about the world like that.

        It's almost as if magic is not even a singular discipline, but many subdisciplines that people spend years and years studying, and is involved in their daily lives, and the author portrays it as simple and shallow not very skill-based and an 11 year old is able to make significant advances over the course of a year starting from zero knowledge.

Harry didn't *do* anything special to come to these positions, but was just rewarded for being already correct by the fictional world's (or the author's) standards. The rewards fell into his lap without him doing any meaningful work.

              I respectfully disagree. He had a unique perspective due to his scientific knowledge, it's fairly well explained why they wouldn't have come up with that on their own. The wizarding world is demonstrably behind, practically medieval in many ways (what's what I meant by the world is presented like that), and a standard member of the wizarding world wouldn't have had a hope of discovering partial transfiguration any more than they'd have been able to discover germ theory IMO.

                Again, it's not that he knows some science, or is any good at research. It's just because he happens to know the author's pet theory of physics and believe in the author's transhumanism. If partial transfiguration was possible due to Believing In some other theory of physics or something else that Harry doesn't know that wasn't the author's pet theory, Harry wouldn't have been able to do anything.

I honestly don't know what theory you're referring to that is supposedly fringe science or whatever.

That this image that's in Harry's head (which is emphatically NOT reality, hence the hilarious map and territory error) constitutes a roughly correct representation of physical theory is something that many physicists would contest. It, and your reductionism, are certainly incorrect metaphysics.

                    EDIT: Besides, to go to physics is wholly inappropriate given the conceptual level that the problem lives at, which is the meaning of what is a discrete object.

                      Interesting, and I’m not sure I see what’s incorrect about my reductionist view, but putting that aside for one moment from memory none of the physics mentioned is required to be correct to have the more simple realisation of “if transfiguring a discreet object is simply changing a set of atoms, why can’t any group of atoms be changed regardless of where we subjectively decide discreet objects end?”

                      Perhaps my interpretation of the scene is more forgiving than yours, but as I can accept the above makes sense with currently accepted physics, I don’t agree that it requires the world to fit with his pet theory for it to work.

                        Like, ignore my claims about what is specifically wrong with Harry's image and what it implies about the magic there. The point that I think you could agree with here is that he didn't need to do any research, or really any serious thinking at all to win, he just needed to have known some specific bit of esoteric theory that *just happens* to solve his problem. No methods of rationality, no critical thinking, just power handed to the protagonist for free. This is a key point where he should have failed, demonstrating that book knowledge is not the same thing as having the skill to do research, because Harry doesn't have that. Research is difficult and requires domain specific skill and knowledge, and there is nothing that Harry has done to gain any of that. Instead, Harry wins because he knows Science^(TM) and everyone is humbled by him.

                        A nice rationalist lesson, which the author has yet to learn, would be if Harry kept trying to apply and refine this pet physics theory and it kept failing, and Hermione starts suggesting to try something else or that maybe the way he sees the world with this theory glued to his face is incorrect and Harry brushes her off. Then after gaining enough familiarity with Harry's theory from the fresh perspective of someone living outside of it and with a clear view of its failures, she makes specific critiques, which Harry resists for a while, until eventually he realizes he was wrong all along. Then Hermione then delivers a lesson about how one should not be wedded to their pet theories and should be able to view them from the outside, that her perspective not believing the theory and seeing the failures gave her an advantage over Harry in understanding the situation, and Harry should be able to capture some of this while testing theory.

                        Edit: as for this simple realization (which I am also critical of but lets set that aside), one doesn't need to go all the way to atoms to think this way about objects, and the perspective, abstracting out the particulars about atoms, is an obvious first thing to try when confronted with the problem of partial transfiguration. Hence the wizarding community should have figured it out.

                          I think the main thing we disagree on is how plausible it is that Harry as a character could've held the missing piece to make this breakthrough possible, and given how exceptional his perspective is I'm prepared to accept it, you're of course entitled to disagree, it just didn't feel anywhere near as unreasonable or implausible as the typical types of deus ex machina found in other media, at least in my opinion.

                                Yes, and I definitely think that loosening up is a good thing, especially with regards to this sub. I'm not so much criticizing that scene *just* because I think it's wrong, but because the work is specifically meant to be teaching rationality, and that scene is clearly set up as a scene that's meant to convey a rationality lesson (as opposed to a Harry is irrational and fails and we learn the lesson afterwards; Harry doesn't fail here and is immediately rewarded, and rewarded throughout the story). I think that rationality lesson is wrong, and I think it stems from bad philosophy of science which I think is the crux of a lot of what the author gets wrong in his philosophy in the sequence. I use that scene specifically as an example of how his reductionism is a map-territory error. So this isn't just some nit-picking philosophical critique of a not terribly important theme, but a critique that gets at the heart of his philosophy.

      The author often makes what he does fail spectacularly, it's kind of the point of the book. Straight out of the sidebar, "Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction." - Harry does this the entire way through, and it's what makes it useful. The world _doesn't_ bend to make him successful for the most part, that's what makes the story so intriguing.

    throw an extremely smart person and an extremely strong person into a room and have them fight.  who wins 9/10 times?

    now enter self-insert uber smart Rational-Fic characters being thrown into a room being forced to fight an extremely strong person.

    They Notice a Tattoo on the bruisers arm, have a  photographic memory of all gangs and their insignia in the local area, intimate that they are a close personal confidant of the gangs leader and not only does this let them avoid the fight but the bruiser assists them in escaping the whole situation without ever.... idk pulling out the settings equivalent of a cellphone and talking to their boss?

    The MC hears the Bruiser muttering under their breath, and has been studying the worlds languages since the age of eight, responds with the second half of the obscure tribal chant that holds great personal significance to the bruiser, plays out the same as situation one.

    the MC notices the bruiser favoring their left leg(despite having no formal training or brawling experience), intuits that this means the bruiser can be disabled with precise skillful strikes to that area, proceeds to deliver said strikes with surgical precision(despite relative* lack of experience and Total* lack of experience)

    MC notices that some of the rebar that forms the makeshift windows in the room/arena is loose and turns it into not only an impromptu spear to slay the bruiser, but a crude prybar or pick to loosen the other bars thus providing them with an escape route.

    notice what all these scenarios have in common? the MC isn't intelligent, literally nothing and nobody else in the setting is allowed to have agency unless it directly aids the MC in some manner.

    that's why people criticize "smart" characters in the manner they do. not because they're smart, because 9/10 times they're pretty dumb but in a setting where even their limited actual intelligence translates to superpowers.

    smart characters making smart choices is criticized rarely here from what i can see, but authors insisting they've written a smart character is another thing entirely.

          Sherlock Holmes is not rational. Eliezer Yudkowsky has explicitly called him out as an example of a fake intelligent character. From ["Rationalist Fiction"](http://web.archive.org/web/20171118180518/http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/):

          > Now of course there are a great many characters who claim to be using logic.  The whole genre of mystery stories with seemingly logical detectives, starting from Sherlock Holmes, would stand in witness of that.
          > 
          > But when you look at what Sherlock Holmes does - you can't go out and do it at home.  Sherlock Holmes is not _really_ operating by any sort of reproducible method.  He is operating by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems to me that reading Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise.  Holmes is a mutant superhero.  And even if you did try to imitate him, it would never work in real life.

          The Azkaban arc is different. Harry takes down Auror Bahry with the sort of sucker punch that totally works in real life (look up videos of cops being shot by criminals during traffic stops). He figures out how to hide Bellatrix from the Dementors with the Cloak in the same way Eliezer did while writing the chapter. From ["Level 2 Intelligent characters"](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/level2intelligent):

          >I am vain enough to tell you that I probably didn’t use nearly as much sneaky literary artifice to generate Methods of Rationality as you might think.  I did not, in fact, have Dumbledore say in Ch. 17 that the Cloak of Invisibility can hide from the gaze of Death in order to set up Azkaban.  I wrote that line in Ch. 17 to reference canon; and then, while, I was writing the Azkaban arc, I realized that I had entirely by accident given Harry the resource he would need to hide Black even after Dumbledore’s Patronus started tracking Harry’s Patronus and Harry had to dispel his Patronus Charm.  But I do admit that if I hadn’t come up with a clever way for Harry to handle that problem, then Dumbledore would not have been able to track Harry’s Patronus.

          See? Harry gets the Cloak from Dumbledore when he arrives at Hogwarts, just like in canon, and the Cloak has the power to hide you from the gaze of Death, again just like in canon. Then Eliezer decided that the way Dementors were portrayed in canon fit better as death than depression, so he changed them into that, which Harry discovered in the previous arc. _Then_ Harry needs to hide someone from Dementors, and Harry realizes that he can do so by using the Cloak. It makes perfect sense.

          The other noteworthy feat Harry accomplishes in Azakab is his escape. He cuts the wall using partial transfiguration, then rides out on a transfigured rocket. Again, this makes total sense; cutting the wall is completely within the realm of what we have seen partial transfiguration do, and the rocket works because wizards are ignorant of muggle science (just like in canon!) so they have no defense against it. From ["Thoughtful responses and intelligent mistakes"](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/thoughtful-responses):

          >My first idea for how Harry would escape Azkaban was that he would cut through the walls using partial Transfiguration, and then escape on an ordinary broomstick. But other wizards could cut through steel walls with ordinary magic, and if it were that easy to escape Azkaban, somebody would have done it before. The Aurors would have broomsticks of their own, I realized. As for riding out on a fast racing broomstick that could outrun the Aurors, as an ordinary thriller novel might try—no, bull, Amelia Bones would think of that, and make sure her own people had sufficiently good broomsticks to block a Firebolt from escaping. Harry has to think of an escape plan containing some element that Amelia Bones would not be expecting, would _not_ have prepared for, even when she’s trying to be clever.

            That's exactly why I called Sherlock Holmes out. It's ostensibly a story about an extremely observant, well-read, and clever man, but  it just turns out he was handed a copy of the script just before the opening.

            As for Harry, I hear your arguments, but he's literally 11 and up against a wizard cop. I'm all for not underestimating children (and I even agree it *mostly* works in the story!) but it definitely comes across as "now enter self-insert uber smart Rational-Fic character being thrown into a room being forced to fight an extremely strong person"

        This is hard to express and even harder to prove but accurate. I can vividly remember an argument with a teacher over whether a kid in a book was a well written unusual child or a badly written adult in a child's body. The teacher's point was that few adults thought in that particular manner, and mine was that I was a grade school kid sitting right there saying that I did think like that. Decades later, it's impossible to prove I thought like that unless I come across an illuminating journal entry or home video.

        Some kids are weirdly clever. If you never run into one, it's easy to dismiss depictions of them as unrealistic. I've never seen an emu, I don't think anyone I know has seen an emu, and frankly the idea of a bird as tall as I am seems pretty unrealistic. Nevertheless, the Emu War is a thing that happened in the real world. Sometimes when you say something is not believable, that tells others more about you than it tells them about the world.

But I read it as a six year old and didn't find anything unusual about it. A number of my friends had the same experience.

  I feel like what you're describing is largely a trait of self-insert fanfic. That term doesn't fully describe HPMOR or OOS but let's be honest, self insert is more or less the intent when an author decides to overwrite the original character with a more knowledgeable protagonist (who happens to line up with their own perspective) and then spends the book kind of Mary-Sue'ing it up about how everything goes right for them. You are correct that they do not seem particularly realistic about what an 11 year old is capable of, or how they might grow emotionally over time. On the other hand, who says fiction has to be realistic? Have you ever had a fantasy about what *you'd* do if you were given magical superpowers or sucked into the DC universe? Self indulgent fiction isn't automatically *bad* fiction, if it serves some other purpose. I'd argue that HPMOR at least served a number of purposes regardless of literary merit. OOS- eh, I haven't gone as far.

  Some things you may like in the rational-adjacent space:

  [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/)- Frankenstein's monster is now a team of kids. Great characterization and setting, fairly grimdark, little slow in points. Complete.

  [The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/)- A girl has her life turned into an erogame, for better or worse. Lots of NSFW scenes, but astonishingly deep plotting and meta-humor makes this just about the only pornfic I would ever recommend as actually rationalist. Incomplete.

  [Significant Digits](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html)- More-or-less the sequel to HPMOR, by a different author but following the events in the first story. Substantially better from a pulp fiction standpoint, still rationalist-adjacent but not hard R anymore. *Does* do a much better job of examining the character arcs of a lot of the main HPMOR cast. Complete.

  [Fine Structure](https://qntm.org/structure)- Fascinating story with some great world building. I don't know, not actually related to any of the topics covered here, I just rediscovered it as I was trawling through my folders looking for recommendations and maybe you'd enjoy it! Complete.

  Sounds like you like rational fiction but not rationalist fiction.

  from the side bar: 

  >Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.

  >Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.

  >Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.

  >**Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of rationalist fiction, a subcategory of rational fiction.**

  >Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.

  So it sounds like you just don't like the point I bolded which is the major differentiating piece between rational and rationalist fiction.

  If you like intelligent characters not holding the idiot ball whose actions make sense given the motivations behind them, worlds that make sense given the rules defining them and problems that are solvable by the reader then I don't think you're in the wrong place.

  Anyway, in summary you should probably watch out for that distinction and there are plenty of both types here.

  Examples of things which are rational but not rationalist that you may want to check out: Sufficiently Advanced Magic and the rest of Andrew Rowe's works, Cradle series and the rest of Will Wight's stuff, Some of the better written LitRPG genre may also be in your wheelhouse. Stuff like Ascend Online and everything by Dakota Krout would be good examples there.

  Even though I love the concept of rational fiction, I feel like a lot of stories take the rational premise too far (as other posters have already pointed out) and end up with a hyper-rational, almost autistic MC that ends up turning some people away.   

  It's especially glaring if the character is a 12 yo kid, in which case the behavior seems even more out of place - HPMOR and Origin of Species are good examples.  

  I read HPMOR ~5 years ago and then finished it once it was completed and while I liked it then, when I tried to reread it recently; I couldn't. Harry just seemed obnoxious and unrealistic.  

  I'd like to talk about Origin of Species as well. Don't get me wrong, the premise is great, but the execution is lacking imo. And the core problem for me are the protagonists, because I enjoyed reading the interludes alot more than the regular chapters (the Mewtwo one was one of the best chapters I've ever read, so kudos for that).  
  I just cant empathise with 12 yo kids acting like (hyper-rational) adults.   

  To demonstrate my point, I'd like to mention Game of Champions (one of my all time favorites), a Pokemon fanfic with a similar premise that I know a lot of readers here liked.  

  It has a lot of the same premises - realistic Pokemon world with a TR conspiracy, Red has some special abilities...  

  The one key difference however, is in the characters and the tone of writing.  
  First of all, Red is older (16 IIRC) which makes his behavior more believable, but other than that he is also a different person. If TOoS Red is a ***scientist***, GoC Red is a ***warrior***. It might just be me, but I enjoy reading about warriors way more than I do about scientists - as I can be a scientist IRL, but being a warrior isnt very realistic, which makes it more enjoyable to read about.

  But being a warrior doesn't make you dumb! You can be a rational character even if you are a warrior!   
  This is a key point IMO; rationality doesnt need to be applied solely to science and problems of a scientific nature; you can use the principles of rationality to solve a warrior's problems as well. 

  And GoC Blue really does capture the spirit of the Pokemon Red and Blue rival. Always a step ahead, arguably even more talented than the MC and very confident - something that a lot of rational protagonists aren't. In fact, there's a lot of second guessing, hyper-analysis and the worst - overjustification of behavior.  
  Reading about a character apologising profusely for a minor (usually social) misstep, or even worse, trying to explain why he was justified in doing it can become annoying after a while. Juniper from WtC tends to do this last thing a lot. 

  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love WtC - it's the story I'm most excited to see updated atm and Juniper is a much better MC than HPMOR Harry for example, but I feel like he could do without the apologies for social missteps - even though I know that's part of his character.

  To get back to the difference between warrior characters and scientist characters, there's a kind of mastery that warrior characters exude. A sense of competence and readiness for a particular challenge that is missing from most rational fiction. But mostly they are just better at invoking emotions in readers.  

  Humans are emotional creatures. Emotions themselves are supposed to guide our actions in ways that usually benefit us. It's good, even rational to be angry when someone insults you. You can use that anger to see that your next course of action should be to retaliate; whereas rationality can help you find the best way to retaliate.  
  Emotions and rationality can coexist, so sacrifing one in favor of the other is suboptimal, both irl and in stories.

  Well its a mix of power fantasy and rationalist fiction. To avoid the teenager part, and the never fail part, checkout the dresden files. If you dislike the more direct power fantasy, the only thing which is close is the standard objectivist fiction loop of "good"/reasonable adult -> bad things and suppressed for and with reasonable reasons -> overcomes by hard work and virtue -> suppressed for idiotic reasons and ways -> acts like asshole and never changes his mind, win by deus ex machina. If you only read the first three thats pretty good. Say the first few of the terry goodkind series. That said I totally get what you mean, if you actually find something please let me know. Im so tired of the younger and younger people beeing mc in fiction in general, especially the new star trek, it basically means everyone must be a borderline superhero, and it never shows someone who achieved something by  working hard for a lifetime. That said I do appreciate that hpmor shows that harrys petty powerplays directly results in hermiones death. Though he does draw the wrong lesson from that, despite quirells best efforts in teaching him to lose.    
  There is another issue with rationalist fiction, its mysteries are meant to be solved and this has ... unfortunate consequences. The reader, or at least the character must receive sufficient information to make informed decisions. Consider the classic detective story trope of five people on a speeding train, deduce which are lying about what and who could and couldnt have murdered the sixth. Conclude who did it, they confess or reveal themselves to prove the point ... But now imagine no one did it, in actually Kirk transported down from the enterprise out of sight, kills someone, overacts a line, and transports back. No information or hint that this is possible needs to be available, the mystery simply is unsolvable, and the rational character would do his best, follow all best practices and still either conclude s/he does not know, or worse still makes a convincing case to have someone convicted, but remains privately unsure or worse still fails to realize he did couldnt have known. This type of failure is extremely common when you approach real problems and people grow from, not overcoming the failure, but by trying again for the next problem despite this .

  not all characters need growth, but for children it should be mandatory. the thing is, those are not stories about children. they are settings about children. the story itself is a very different thing. 

  hpmor annoys me, because while it starts good... it then stops being interesting to force the plot in a rush to conclusion. the premise was good, but the author seemed to get bored with it halfway through. the problem is basically pacing. if it were spread out across more in-setting years, it would have worked better.

    This applies to most web fiction since almost no stories have proper editors. Consider it as the "Protection From Editors" trope taken to eleven.
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      It's not just that there are no editors, it's that once written, there's a large pressure to not go back and edit old chapters to trim them down if certain things become irrelevant, or to streamline the plot once the author knows more fully where it's going. Pacing is, IMO, one of the hardest things to get right in a web serial, and it's something that even the best web serials routinely fail at.
      ```

      - u/SkoomaDentist:
        ```
        Where does that pressure come from? Or is it just pressure to write new material / not change chapter boundaries?

        I agree that pacing is very difficult in a serial but more than a few web serials suffer from excessive fluff even within the individual chapters. One of my favorites (though not rationalist or even adjacent) is The Deathworlders which desperately needs a heavy handed editor who'd cut out half of the fluff and reduce the per-monthly chapter lengths by a third (not because they're too long but because there's too much pointless padding).

          Fans hate retcons. And fans are also the people giving the most positive feedback, sometimes even for things that aren't objectively good.

          When you edit an as of yet unpublished book no one cares, but in openly available webserials that people love it can cause "Han shot first" type scenarios even over the smallest edit. Look at what happened on /r/parahumans when Wildbow killed off >!Browbeat!< retroactively.

          And even I admit to disliking change like that. Not enough to stand in its way, but enough to download the whole story to make sure I still have access to the original when an author mentions the possibility of rewriting stuff in a story I really liked.
          ```

        - u/alexanderwales:
          ```
          Part of it is time pressure; it takes time to write things, and most serial authors are on a schedule, so if you realize after a scene is written that it could have been cut down by 2K words and still make the same point, or that it's not doing enough to advance the plot ... well, you've got a Patreon set up, and you've promised two 5K chapters a week, and if you cut 2K words from the chapter like you probably should, then you have to make that up, which might not be feasible. (Obviously the pressure is less if there's no monetary incentive, but you still get people saying "that's it?" if you put out a short chapter or take a long time.)

          Part of it is length pressure. There are a lot of readers who will express strong preference for longer stories. I've heard people say that they won't even start on a story until it's over 100K words. Particularly for readers of web fiction, there are a lot of people who lean on the quantity side of the quantity/quality divide.

          And as far as editing things that have already been published goes, most people who have already read it won't read the edits, and it causes confusion in the community because the canon is changing, and it's really only in service to new readers, and you can't really get as good of feedback on whether the changes are actually worthwhile or not.

  I think people have already given you other recs you might enjoy, between Worth the Candle, Worm, Practical Guide to Evil, and Arcane Ascension/Sufficiently Advanced Magic. But I just wanted to chime in and say I 100% understand what you mean- I've been reading MoL since 2011, and the things I enjoy about it aren't necessarily common to the other stuff that gets posted here.

  So really, what parts appeal to you? It's easy to see what you don't like about the above stories, but what do you like? Do you enjoy the meta-narrative stuff, do you like characters essentially muchkining systems, do you like the systems of growth more from a skill or character perspective?

  But yeah, I feel like some of the stuff that gets posted here (i.e. The Good Student) either isn't very good or doesn't appeal to me. And I read HPMOR as an offshoot of other Harry Potter fanfiction, so there's a whole bevy of other related text to compare it against and issues that it has, especially with the supercilious/preachy nature of the protagonist, both the protagonists and antagonists acting as author mouthpieces, the show v. tell divide, etc.

  I think the enjoyment of rationalist fiction is related to how much one appreciates optimization, mental thinking exercises, solvable sherlock holmes-esque puzzles. Intellectual porn, basically. I also like fiction that leads me to think "this should happen" and then have a character agree on the next page "this will happen", like a sort of mental link between the reader and the writer.

  I see how you could say that for hpmor, even if I disagree.
  But OoS doesn't seem to fit it at all in any way.

  And In both cases the characters do know their stuff most of the time , as opposed to just saying  half understood technical terms to sound smart. 

  While just  knowing about  bayesian statistics, and biases, or goal factoring or whatever doesn't always help you actually be correct  (like Harry learnt in the end)  it does sometimes. 

  Also, while overconfidence is a problem heuristics like  "adults always know better" or "somebody would have though about it before "  don't always work.
  Underconfidence is also a problem. 

  Even in my own life I have sometimes avoided doing something out of that kind of consideration(plus lazyness), asuming that if something hasn't been done before there must be a reason. 
  Only for someone else to do it some time latter, showing that I could have totally done it. 

  And In stories it might actually be the case that the relevant adults don't actually  know how to design a proper experiment.

  There are in-bounds story reasons as to why he is as smart as he is as well.   There's also pretty clear world reasons why wizards wouldn't be aware of the scientific method or think in the ways Harry does.

  I'd say this sub started off primarily for that sort of /r/iamverysmart type stories, but it's really evolved into a web fiction subreddit that's more for stories published on the internet than particularly intelligent stories. You seem to just want the quality web fiction.

  [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/) is great, it's a semi-realistic portrayal of "what if people got super powers".

  [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) Literary tropes have real power in this world, and the main character gets recruited to the Dark side.

  I also recommend just browsing topwebfiction.com

    This is my rough outline of the history of /r/rational:

    * Mar, 2009: Yudkowsky [posts on LessWrong about Rationalist Fiction](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3m/rationalist_fiction/), naming *Null-A* and *David's Sling*.
    * Mar, 2010: Yudkowsky posts first chapters of *[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](http://www.hpmor.com/)*, originally under (fairly obvious) pseudonym.
    * Nov, 2010: Alicorn posts first chapters of *[Luminosity](http://luminous.elcenia.com/)*, a HPMOR-like reimagining of Twilight.
    * Nov, 2012: Iceman posts *[Friendship is Optimal](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/62074/friendship-is-optimal)* to fimfiction.net
    * May, 2013: Velorian posts *[Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)*
    * Sep, 2013: I post *[Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time)* to ff.net.
    * Oct, 2013: DayStarEld posts [*Pokemon: The Origin of Species*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9794740/1/Pokemon-The-Origin-of-Species) to ff.net. Yudkowsky recommends [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) in an author's note, which pretty much everyone reads.
    * Dec, 2013: Following some discussions on /r/HPMOR (and a dry period for that fic), /r/rational is created. *Branches* is one of the first stories posted there, as is [*The Last Christmas*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9915682/1/The-Last-Christmas).
    * May, 2013: I post [*A Bluer Shade of White*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10327510/1/A-Bluer-Shade-of-White) (originally written in response to a prompt). Later in the month, I post the first chapter of [*Metropolitan Man*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10360716/1/The-Metropolitan-Man) (which finishes at slightly less than a chapter a week in June).

    As for how many of those are /r/iamverysmart material, that would be much more subjective.

      ```
      I always liked the first book of Luminosity because it decide the expectation that the main character never makes mistakes due to her intelligence. It's only >!in the end that she realizes the magnitude of how wrong she was and brings harm to all of her allies because of it!<. Of course the next book and epilogue reverse all that, but they were still an interesting read.
      ```

  Remember the difference between rational and rationalist fiction; this is a sub for both. You're looking for rational, the majority of the sub, not rationalist, which are the stories that can be r/iamverysmart.

  I'd recommend the *[Cradle](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01H1CYBS6/)* series by Will Wight. It's of the Xianxia genre, which is usually garbage fiction, poorly written (because it's usually translated from Chinese), super irrational, and emotionally dumb and cringy. Cradle, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing, incredibly well written, and has rational world building and characters (in that the world and character are coherent and make decisions that make sense from their perspectives). I love the series so much. It got me into Xianxia, but I can't find anything *nearly* as good as Cradle.

  Will Wight is an amazing author. In addition, the series also had audiobooks made by Travis Baldree, who's an amazing narrator and voice actor. The audiobooks are amazing. You can join us at r/Iteration110Cradle, which is also the sub for all of Will's other books, which all exist in the same multiverse.

  That earlier link is to the first book, Unsouled. Here's the summary.

  >Sacred artists follow a thousand Paths to power, using their souls to control the forces of the natural world.

  >Lindon is Unsouled, forbidden to learn the sacred arts of his clan.

  >When faced with a looming fate he cannot ignore, he must rise beyond anything he's ever known...and forge his own Path.

  I highly recommend it; it's among the best stories that this sub can recommend. It's just not shown as often because it's a series of six novels (so far), not regularly updating web serials. The magic system is super cool and satisfying too, which also awesome.

  Also, another rec, to satisfy the learning and discover that MoL provides is [A Hero's War](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War).

  >Summary: Morey is summoned to a fantasy world under siege by the forces of darkness, called a Hero by the natives. Unknown to them, they got two 'Heroes' for the price of one. Dumped into a strange and dangerous fantasy world, Cato struggles to find out what happened to him and where he is. And perhaps there are advantages to not being a Hero. And perhaps not all the legends are true...

  Cato does a lot of science and discovery. It's not at all r/iamverysmart. Instead, it's very down to earth and close to people. I really like this one too; it's one of the places mentioned in my flair. (Now that I mention that, I should add something from Cradle to that, too...)

  I'm not gonna bother recommending anything else, because this thread is full of other good recs. 👍

  THANK YOU! I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE! I too enjoy MoL and was excited when I found the genre. Then I started to read the Harry Potter one and became very disillusioned very quickly.

    Well, HPMOR basically founded the genre. And really, it was written as much as fanfiction as to be a vehicle for EY's own ideas and theories about rationality, which means it really gets a bit pamphlet-y at times. I still enjoyed it a lot but I won't lie, sometimes I would just skim over Harry's rants. I enjoyed the plot, the take on the magical world, the clever battles involving the Armies, and the occasional joke at the expense of the canon. And Minerva McGonagall. Poor Minerva McGonagall.
    ```

- u/Gray_Gryphon:
  ```
  Have you tried The Optimized Wish Project? It's a Dragonball rationalfic that still preserves a lot of the original series' tone/genre. Goku is much smarter, but there are a lot of scenes also showing that he's just a kid, as well as some scenes showing emotions getting the best of him.
  ```

- u/ToaKraka:
  ```
  > So my main complaints are about the MCs, they both start the fiction around 11/12 years old and I understand them being smart are part of the novelisation but they spend their entire time spouting logical fallacies and /r/iamverysmart-esque dialogue.

  I can't say anything about *The Origin of Species*, but HJPEV does lose his overconfidence later in the story.

  > Any recommendations more like Mother of Learning?

  [*Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) (insert complaints about torture and mind rape) is very similar (IMO).

    >[*Time Braid*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644) (insert complaints about torture and mind rape)

    Don't forget the [sexually active 12-year-old child soldiers](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ah7czb/nsfwffrthfc_friendship_is_mind_control_twilight/#eesjhwt)!

      That actually sounds like something I'm perfectly fine with forgetting.
      ```

- u/Yes_This_Is_God:
  ```
  I felt your frustrations when I first started exploring the genre. Both MoR and OoS feel like they are more a way to feel superior and "rational" than actually trying to tell a good story.

  For me, a good rational story is interested in the storytelling first and the rationality second. 

  I would recommend Worth the Candle, A Practical Guide to Evil, and Delphic.
