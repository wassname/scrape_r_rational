## Do you think this community is a bit snobby?

### Post:

I mean,  I don't think I've met a single poster who I'd  call a bad person or even a difficult-to-get-along with person. 

 It's just that, the longer I'm  around this community, the more I feel like the main purpose of this is to look down on every other community of fiction. 

Again,  it's not a single person, nor a single comment. But a lot of the small undertones in fanworks have this kind of snobbish feel to them, like they can't stand any character that doesn't belong in this club of super smart characters. 

Like say with HPMOR, where every non hyper intelligent character is cut out, like Ron,  who in the original material was the part of the main castle.

Or with the third highest upvited post on the sub, where a character in a zombie apocalypse repeatedly goes:

"Oh God,  you're so stupid,  Oh God,  you're so stupid,  I'm so fucking intelligent and you're so stupid"

I know that's not directly stated in text, but it's kind of what I got.  Not a love of the genre that comes with most fanfiction,  but more of a " Oh geeeeze, this is what I have to work with.  Can you believe this? "

That's kind of why the above examples felt insulting. It felt like a shallow and bitter satire coming from a person that thinks they know what's better. 

Again, I know I'm intruding here a bit,  but I'm not doing this out of malice or anything. It's actually a bit out of respect for the sub

If I wanted to post a criticism of any other piece of  media I wouldn't do it on the sub devoted to that media but I'm posting it here because I know this sub prides itself discussion  and self reflection, so it would felt like unnecessarily talking behind someone's back if I posted it somewhere else.

So yeah. That's it.

  So, like, in science fiction fandom there's a subset of the fandom that is really into diamond hard SF... that's what they're into. They get upset that the video version of _The Expanse_ has this illustration of the intercept of a spaceship with an asteroid and they get the orbital mechanics COMPLETELY WRONG. Like don't they even know Newton's three laws? Sheesh. And don't get me started on Gravity.

  This is basically the same kind of thing for character and narrative. People here don't care if the story is hard SF or not, they just care that _given that you accept the backstory_ the narrative actually makes sense, and the people in the story live up to their characters.

  And just as most SF (particularly most media SF) isn't really hard SF, it turns out that most supposedly intelligent characters are not written intelligently. So it gets on the nerves of people who care about that stuff.

  If you're not someone who cares about that stuff, you probably won't dig it.

    heck, sometime you can pinpoint that single moment in plot where there is an obvious idiot-ball handed to a character for the sole purpose of screwing them over to move the plot along. an action that seems out of character with how that character has been shown in the story thus far. like the author just gave up at that point. 

    other times, you get a charcter who is, on close examination, a specific kind of idiot throughout the entire story (Merlin from the Amber series books 6 through 10, for example). oh sure, genius at some things, no bloody common sense otherwise. if written well, you may not even notice it right away. 

    now, the idiot MC can be a good story and very interesting, but it is a very different sort of story than one that focuses on the competance of the MC to move the plot. 

    in general, i prefer stories where there is some thinking going on. plots that revolve around being clever, or that explain new concepts that i had not heard of before, are good things. i detest stories where the plot revolves around ignorance, and the author never explains anything either so the reader is in the dark to things as well (and yes, i have seen that in a novel, it was very bad).

      This mischaracterisation is common. Perfect characters are shit and probably Mary Sue's. Intelligent characters are not supposed to be flawless, they are supposed to make *believable* mistakes and they're supposed to show their intelligence by making actual intelligent decisions, the thought processes for which we have access too, not by telling the reader that they can speak fifty fake languages or beat other 'intelligent' characters at 'fantasy-chess'.

        Here’s a good example:

        In With This Ring, early on the character gets an orange power ring and, because it runs off desire and the OC lost money in the recession, the ring disintegrates money (and credit cards) on contact.  The OC got around this by carrying gold coins certified by the US treasury.  In retrospect he could have just taken the stupid thing off whenever he went shopping, but he was so caught up in having super powers and high on the orange light that it never occurred to him.  That’s a *believable* mistake.  On the other hand, if the character never bothered to check if it worked on credit cards and he went around bumming money off people for the rest of the series, that’s an immersion-killing mistake.

        One follows character flaws, the other just doesn’t bother figuring out how things work.

          >he was so caught up in having super powers and high on the orange light that it never occurred to him.

          Also, since the ring takes care of all his body's needs, and the Justice League provides accommodation, and he can pretty much transmute any mundane material at will, he never ran into a financial crunch that would really force him to revisit that. >!And he found out that Ploutos, the Greek god of money, has helped to make this world's economy a bit more sane, which helped him get over his contempt for fiat currency, making it eventually a non-issue.!<

    - u/AnimaLepton:
      ```
      It's more about both intelligence and consistency. It's great when characters make believable mistakes, but it can be grating when a character makes a mistake that any reader can immediately point to and come up with a better/in-character solution using only the knowledge available to the character. And it's very hard to write a character that's more intelligent than you, so as an author, your best bet is just taking some time to think through the character's actions and their consequences.

      Of course, rational fics want the protagonist and possibly antagonist to be rational, but not every character in the setting. And all characters can be rational but working towards opposing goals depending on their experience and outlook on life. It has its flaws, but it's just another structure for a story. And perhaps to a greater degree than many other types of fiction, rational fiction is about diving down and addressing story tropes- sometimes playing them straight, but sometimes deconstructing them in interesting ways.

      I'm not concerned about whether the Nauvoo's orbit was realistic because they have the bullshit physics spacedrive. I'm talking about the geometry of the impact itself.

      Look, here's a whole thread analyzing the impact in detail:

      https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/5vkcpz/episode_discussion_s02e05_home/de836vt/

      This is the image I'm talking about: http://i.imgur.com/5h7vTQj.png - this makes no sense, to drop Eros into the sun they would need to be travelling significantly faster than the asteroid (since there is no way the Nauvoo had anything like the same mass) and in a vector that was pretty precisely opposite to its orbit, not coming in from the countersolar point like a big baseball bat. That would leave it still in orbit, with a lower perihelion and a higher apohelion and possibly in an Earth-crossing orbit.

    I think that the key problem is, if you care about the details - like SF physics - then watching a story ignore them *breaks suspension of disbelief*. It jolts you out of enjoying the story and *reminds* you that it's fiction. Of course, everyone has different pet peeves, so not everyone cares about the particular traits that this subreddit wants to fix.

    Given the above, it's understandable, I think, that many community members seem annoyed at non-rational fiction. The non-rationality has spoiled their reading/viewing experience.

  I know that after finding out about this genre and thoroughly loving it I've found it difficult to really get into books without a rational protagonist. But I personally don't look down on people with different tastes or those tastes themselves.

  I've got two roommates, one is a medical student and the other is a doctor. One loves the shit out of cringe comedy (Inbetweeners and Blue Mountain State) and hated Mad Max Fury Road. The other is a huge fan of dark comedies with stupid death scenes and laughs long and hard at them. Otherwise both are incredibly intelligent and great company. in my view a person's taste is a bit like their fetish. It rarely impacts who they are outside of that taste. I don't like it but I respect it.

  tl;dr: to each their own. 

  But that's just me.
  ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    For me personally this genre made it harder to enjoy thinking about and theorizing about less rational protagonists. Good literature and media that isn't very rational is still enjoyable to consume, but thinking about it during the process and trying to make predictions is less enjoyable since you're likely to be wrong for dumb reasons. 

    There's also two levels of rationalist fiction in my opinion, the first level is just characters and settings that a trying to be realistically consistent and the second is where characters actively break down their thought processes as a focus. I'm not a huge fan of the second level so maybe that makes it easier on me.

    Another factor is that I believe stories that are rational are more likely to be good, authors that think hard and plan things out tend to make more rational works and better authors tend to do those steps better, so we kind of get spoiled here. 

    I do wonder how people who like mystery/whodunit stories get effected by this community. I never really liked the genre before and this community encouraging deeper examination might have made it worse for me (not counting the cool rational ones where they actively try to be solvable).
    ```

    - u/Mingablo:
      ```
      I agree with you. Unfortunately my love of rationalist fiction also coincided with a period in which I dove deep into breakdowns of story tropes. The effect seems to have compounded.

      I'd also further delineate rational fiction into stories with either a rational protagonist and/or a rational world. I like a rational protagonist trying to makes sense of a seemingly irrational world (Practical guide) or a somewhat irrational protagonist trying to make their way in a completely rational world, although this is rarer.

      As for mysteries, I've never liked them unless they're very off the wall (Commander Vimes or Dirk Gently). Strangely enough these also seem to be quite rational.

          I've wracked my brains for the past half hour trying to think of something but I've drawn a blank. The sub-genre has to exist but I don't know anything that really qualifies. I think that most people who set out to have a world that is well defined and reacts in ways that can be predicted want to make a protagonist that can use it.

    I'm here because I like munchkinry and overpowered protagonists, as long as they're not too Mary Sue.  There are two completely different ways that I've seen this done well.  Rational fiction is a good way to make  protagonists earn their powers by cleverly exploiting whatever world they're in, so it doesn't feel cheap.  Alternatively, flawed and ridiculous characters like in One Punch Man or One Piece or The Seventh Horcrux makes it clear that you're not supposed to take the characters seriously or praise how amazing they are because that's not the point of the story.

    I like rational protagonists who I can identify with and deliberately irrational protagonists who I'm supposed to laugh at and enjoy the show.  It's the uncanny valley in between that annoys me, where they're inconsistent and act normally most of the time except when the plot demands that they do something stupid.

  Yes, it's a persistent problem with the community, and has been pretty much since its inception. Part of the problem is that mean-spirited "parody" is a lot easier than an honest attempt at deconstruction and/or reconstruction. It's easy to laugh at some dumb thing a writer did because they wanted to move the plot along and not ask questions, but it's *hard* (or at least takes *effort*) to follow a premise through to its natural conclusion, or to rebuild the premise so that it's got the same conclusion but with more nuance and thought. So people will just do the mean-spirited pointing-out-flaws thing, because that requires little effort (and frankly, little intelligence).

  For my part, I try not to do that kind of thing, because I think there's way too much of it, both in this subreddit, and in the wider culture. It's a tough battle though, because one side is spending more time and effort than the other. (And I will grudgingly admit to not being perfect, as well as being a snob of a different sort.)

Then i saw this and figured that you're more on top of this sub than I and not prone to exaggeration so there must be something to the claim, and then EY has replied and implied this is an issue the sub has as well and i'm wondering what on earth i've been oblivious to all this time.

    I'm not asking you to single out any specific users/comments but do any examples come to mind of problematic posts/threads in the past that are representative of the sort of issue you're speaking of? I'm baffled at what i've been missing but clearly i'm missing something.

    - u/alexanderwales:

      I think it's useful to divide the community out into the the commentariat and the writers, because they have very different roles, and each contribute to "the community" in different ways.

      For writers, the thing I'll see most often is a snide contempt for the source material, namely by having characters point out how stupid some thing that happened in canon was (even though it's not canon in their own work). This is similarly the case when there's a Lone Sane Man who is the only point of departure for the work, and who spends most of his time "satirically" pointing out everything dumb in the world with very little charity given to the original worldbuilding/plot. This, I think, has tapered off a bit with time, but a lot of the 2013-2014 era stuff was in that vein, and I still see it from time to time. I don't tend to find it particularly clever, in part because criticism by way of exaggeration and denigration doesn't seem (to me) like it takes too much work or thought.

      For the commentariat ... I actually would say that it's gotten better over time, but it's really hard to judge. What I mean is mostly comments in the form of "that's dumb, why did X not do Y?" without any actual consideration for why X didn't do Y. It's not so much the criticism, I guess, it's the format of the criticism and the feeling that whoever is doing the talking went in with a negative mindset looking for things to complain about, regardless of whether those complaints were actually grounded in cogent thought. To give some analogies, it's like a hard scifi fan picking up a soft scifi book and picking it apart piece by piece, or someone who's really into wine picking up a ten dollar bottle to mercilessly mock its quality.

      There's a lot of that stuff all over the internet. "People complain about things" is a cottage industry where you can make good money. It's not that it doesn't have a place, it's just that it seems to me that it's pretty low value, because it doesn't take much effort and doesn't tend to produce good content. I'm much more of the mind that "rational fiction" as a genre should be about creating new things or exploring old things, not simply being negative about works that are outside the genre and don't live up to ideals that they weren't even aspiring to.

      (The extent to which the above actually matches to "snobbery" is up for debate, as is the question of to what extent it's actually a problem present in writers or the commentators.)

        Your second example is probably not great because some of the best sci fi of all time is soft sci fi.  I would even argue that the sizable majority of the best sci fi, from like a critical/literary point of view, is soft sci.  I think a lot of the r/rational community views fiction as being essentially a manual or set of instructions rather than as an artistic device.  There are a lot of reasons why this is the case but I think that kind of attitude lends itself very strongly to the type of piecemeal criticism that used to be common.  I will say that the community is mostly just r/goodwebserials at this point, though, so maybe these criticisms of the community in general are a little mistimed.

          It's the whole truth vs beauty thing, isn't it? Art is a set of psychological manipulations to make things interesting, sheer unadulterated communication of truth as you see it is best reserved for academic papers (and even then learn to write engagingly, please!). That's why I love Blindsight and the Masquerade series so much. They're beautiful, and teach you something useful along the way.

          You could say the same of stuff like HPMoR and The Waves Arisen, honestly. For all HPMoR's flaws, it had one of the best antagonists I've ever seen in fiction. The character writing for Quirrel was superb, and the writing style was sugary and delicious.

      I think the important (and bad) part of the easy, mean-spirited approach is that it's *just* pointing out flaws, rather than providing constructive value of its own. You could definitely call HPMoR mean-spirited in parts, but I think it did an excellent job of reconstructing various aspects of the setting, and creating consistent rules to explain things like Time Turners and Transfiguration. So I think it's actually quite a good example of the second category, of rebuilding a premise with more nuance and thought, and that's one of the things I really loved about it.

        With HPMOR, one problem that it faced is that there's a whole host of good Harry Potter fanfiction that's long since dived into and deconstructed magic in different/interesting ways, or delved into the characters/Voldemort in particular. There are some thing HPMOR does particularly well, but also a fair chunk of things that weigh it down.

        As someone who got into it from the "Harry Potter fanfic" side of things, it does a lot of pure rewriting of the magic, which is one of the factors that makes it "feel" less like Harry Potter- these rules works well in fiction where you get to purely establish the setting, but less so when you're changing an existing one and your character's exploitation/munchkinry is effectively only possible because you created rules that allowed it. You're literally rewriting existing rules by author fiat, which is fine in most fanfiction, but feels out of place in a self-proclaimed "rational" fic. For transfiguration, canon HP transfigurations do not actually run out of magic and revert. In comparison, I've read fics like Taure's "The Power He Knows Not" that capture that magic and have prose that feels familiar to the series.

        And of course, it feels overly bloated- much of Hermione's adventures, the actual battles post part 1, etc. Or for another example, the idea of magic being stored and transferred for potions with acorns is a common idea in HP fanfic. But HPMOR presents that and other ideas/innovations only up because Harry thought about it without experimentation, offscreen. The magic is only narrated to the reader directly before the event and generally only shows up when he needs that bit of magic.

      Nah, I'm a literary snob. Not *that much* of a snob, but a bit of one. I like my stories to have themes, to not meander too much from their central conceit or plot, to have strong characterization that ties in with the plot in some way, flaws that get overcome, etc. Good prose too, though I'm a little more lenient about that if the pacing is good.

      For a lot of people, none of that stuff is really vital. It might be nice to have, but if it's missing, eh, so long as there's a lot of it, that might be fine.

        I've always thought that different stories usually have different strengths - characters, world building, plot, etc. If you try to do a bunch at once, you might end up with an epic - a big book with lots of characters, a lot of different countries and people, and multiple stories going at once. Comparatively, a good tragedy only needs a few characters, and a few locations. (And the characters usually have flaws because that's where the story comes from.)

          This is why most epic fiction written nowadays is kinda bad.  They all try to be the story of ten different people and end up being ten bad stories.  The reason why epic poetry works so well is because it's the story of one person in many places or else one place and many persons.  Trying to tell the story of many persons in many places undermines each individual story you try to tell by drawing importance away from that story.

            I've always been drawn to it (when reading physical books) because, all else being equal, reading a good book which is longer is better. Sometimes an author didn't feel like splitting up one story into separate volumes, and instead of a series, there's just a stand alone book and it's great and it has less of that problem. I've only read one epic I didn't enjoy (and finish reading) and it was the Wheel of Time - 12 books, each super long, and the author died before writing the last book, which ended up getting published as 3 books, and that really should have been my first clue.

            That doesn't mean writing a good book that's longer is just as easy, but as a series goes on, it seems to happen naturally.

              Lord of the Rings is really, really good because of the way that the prose at the start of the epic is very workmanlike and as the stakes grow higher and the book becomes more myth-like, the prose takes on those traits as well.

  Community as a whole? Probably. Individual posters? Not so much.

  I think it's partly the "atmosphere" of the place, where people that like well constructed stories can hang out. A lot of the time, we go out with irl friends to see hollywood movies or something, and it's a bit jarring when they enjoy all the lights and colours and you're just shaking your head at how contrived the story is, or thinking about all the ridiculous plot holes/lack of continuity.

  You might try to discuss this with them, but the reply will usually be "it's just a movie, lighten up and enjoy it".

  So this is a safe haven to discuss works that have, a "higher" level of story construction, amazing foreshadowing, and all around enjoyable stories that don't have too many writing issues common to mass works.

  As such, a *slight* bit of snobbishness at works that "normies" watch and enjoy is kinda expected (even though no one here will say it out loud).

    Even then, people are "snobby" for different things. You can find faults in one game/movie/book and just blatantly ignore them in another because you enjoy it overall and use circular reasoning to justify your enjoyment.

  Yeah.  It's part of being adjacent to the rationalist community.  As far as group vices go, it's not so terrible.  The community is otherwise pretty great, and has even more strengths than what might be immediately obvious.

  I also feel like that sort of condescension is something more for people newish to discovering the rationalist-sphere and you don't see it in more mature work.  You might spot that attitude in discussion, but the top current stories don't exhibit it.

  >It's just that, the longer I'm around this community, the more I feel like the main purpose of this is to look down on every other community of fiction.

  The purpose of this community is to find/share/enjoy fiction that doesn't have the particular kinds of gaping plot holes that we're hypersensitive to. Unfortunately those kinds of plot holes are extremely common even if popular, otherwise well written fiction.

  Other people are free to like (or not *dislike*) other fiction for the qualities they care about. But so long as other fiction has the flaws we don't like, we're going to sneer at it a bit. I don't think that really makes us 'snobby' because we're not excluding people--merely defining what our group is and why we like it better than other places.

    For a bit of a point of comparison, I'd put forth the LitRPG community, and more specifically, one of its biggest ambassadors, Ramon Mejia, who hosts LitRPG Podcast and does several book reviews per week.

    From everything I've seen, Ramon is a very friendly and positive guy who is incredibly generous with his time: because he's such a lynchpin of the LitRPG community, a lot of self-published authors ask him directly for advice about how to label and market their books -- and he nearly always takes the time to provide direct (and sometimes detailed) answers to their questions.  And one of the things that he's most often asked by authors is, "Is the story that I've written LitRPG?  Or do you think I should stick to using a GameLit novel or something similar?"  I'm not sure that everyone would consider Ramon Mejia to be "the face" of the LitRPG community, but if he is, I don't think you could ask for a more friendly and welcoming representative.

    That being said, with LitRPG being a very fast-growing label in the Amazon Kindle store, there have been a lot of self-published authors who have been labeling their stuff as LitRPG simply to show up in search results.  There are also slightly less shameless versions of this, where people will take an existing work, spend a few hours adding the bare minimum of elements to be considered LitRPG, and then re-release it under a new title to find a new audience.  And then you have the more earnest version of this, where people say, "Hey, this seems like a cool community that is hungry for more content!" and they start writing LitRPG stories (perhaps even in a way that's well-intentioned) without taking the time to read in the genre and acquire a basic understanding of what LitRPG is. 

    One of the things that Ramon has been pretty adamant about on his book review podcast is calling out stories that are not LitRPG despite being labeled as such.  He gives each book a numerical score on a scale of 1-10, and anything that is not really LitRPG frequently gets several points knocked off.  Some of these reviews even praise books for being well-written but then give a score of 6/10 because "not LitRPG."  I don't think Ramon has a problem with these kinds of stories existing; he wouldn't take a book like The Hobbit and say "6/10, not LitRPG."  But if you label your work as LitRPG, you are asking to be judged by a certain rubric, and part of that rubric is, "Is this delivering on the basic expectations of LitRPG readers?"  If the answer to that question is "no," then that's fine, but don't come to LitRPG communities expecting people to respond favorably to your work.

    I don't think that many people on this subreddit have a problem with, say, Marvel movies.  I myself quite enjoy them, and I think most other people here would say the same.  But if you posted a thread on /r/rational for "[RT] Thor Ragnarok" I think you'd have a lot of people who would say, "This doesn't belong here."  I don't think that makes you a snob, any more than pointing out that, say, using /r/lego as a place to discuss K'NEX is probably not in line with the spirit or intention of of what that subreddit is for.

  Actually, that personified our frustration perfectly. Ratfic was born out of frustration. Too many fictions left plotholes untreated. So, when a fiction point out something, anything, being stupid, we rejoice. Because, for once, a character can be aware of stupidity, either in their setting or in other character. Of course on that example the stupidity is exaggerated so you might find it insulting. But well, that's that.

          You know that you can just go to a library or book shop and get more books right?  I don't mean to be rude, but you're not saying that book length is an issue, you're just saying that either you don't have the ability to purchase books or you don't have the ability to go to the library.  If it's neither of those, then you're just saying that you don't want to ever finish a book.  That's a position you can have - but reading pace has nothing to do with it.

      My guess is they mean vocabulary, literary writing (as opposed to functional), good description, etc. Some of the books here are definitely kind of sloppy on that, like Mother of Learning, but as flagamuffin says people don't care about it here, while publisher's offices would.

      I've seen a few books lately that have made it to the mainstream in that form though, like The Martian, so maybe things are changing. I definitely care more for a good, consistent plot over literary constructs.

    - u/None:
      ```
      it depends on your standard. 500000 words of a unique plot, free? that’s amazing. it’s understandable not to look past that, although i cannot personally bear to. 

      but many of the most commonly posted stories here are simply not publishable (i mean because of quality not because the publishing industry isn’t a fan of web serials). they have plot holes, terrible characterizations, verbosity, internal inconsistency.... some of them are flat poor: ungrammatical, strangely-worded, etc. i do think most if not at all rational fiction posted here lives in a bubble.

      it also depends what you’re comparing them to. comparing hpmor to any other piece of harry potter fanfiction? it comes out way ahead. comparing it to published, polished fantasy literature? half of it needs a rewrite, although that doesn’t take away from the readability. and note that hpmor is the gold standard.

      so i don’t consider you guys snobbish. i consider myself snobbish. 

      —

      what’s essentially happened is web serials have become synonymous with genre fiction. no one’s writing a web serial that resembles a cormac mccarthy or thomas pynchon novel in any way. and as usually happens to genre fiction, the stuff at the top is unforgettable and everything else is mediocre or worse. so my answer to your question is — almost all of them.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Yeah, I definitely agree. Most of the books I read are traditionally published works by veteran authors where it would be *really* surprising if they hadn't gone through multiple drafts and multiple edits. Serial web fiction? *Some of it the author doesn't read a second time before posting.*

        If I can speak with some measure of authority, as someone who writes (and has written) more than a million words of web fiction posted to this subreddit in the last few years ... yeah, most of it is held to a different, lower standard, and all of it would be massively improved by the traditional publishing process, assuming that there were no hack frauds involved who wanted to make everything generic and juvenile (or juvenile in the wrong way). *Editors improve books*, that's their job. They do copy-editing, line editing, and structural editing to smooth things out and make things better.

        Now, that said, I do think that there's a good chance that the top 1% of web fiction might beat the middle of the bell curve for published fiction, but that's Sturgeon's Law in action, and whether it's even true will depend on sensitivity to the specific errors and problems that editors and a review process are most likely to catch.

          If we say that Ward and Worth the Candle are probably the two best web serials around, then you're right that they're pretty close to some of the good genre fiction.  However, I think that if you expand that out to the next rung of quality, it drops off pretty hard.  Maybe UNSONG might be up there?  Other than that, it's all fun and good but also clearly very pulpy.

            Like you said,

            >20000 people have favorited hpmor and 20000 completely different people have favorited a draco malfoy and hermione granger romance novel.

            And even that kinda shows that you're not familiar with Draco/Hermione not being all too uncommon.

            The demographics of people who enjoyed HPMOR don't necessarily line up with the HP fanfic community at large. In online discussions about HPMoR back when it was being published, there were a large number of people who said that they had never read another HP fanfic and weren't ever planning to read another one. And of course, popularity doesn't equal quality- robst writes some of the most popular Harry Potter fanfics, but they're all literally the same fic repackaged. 

            It's just another subset/bubble, but look at HPMOR recommendations on the main Harry Potter fanfiction subreddit: [it's up there in terms of recommendations, at 41st place, but definitely not even close to the most recommended fic.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/169NVDxmtgDuwB7O1rZenT_WfKWTJqs-k-cdxd37xHWw/edit#gid=410390511)

            For some good fics that I enjoyed more than HPMOR: Seventh Horcrux, To Shape and Change, The Sum of their Parts, Stages of Hope, Magicks of the Arcane, Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time, Forging the Sword, On the Way to Greatness, What you Leave Behind, Like a Red Headed Stepchild, The Changeling, The One He Feared. Victoria Potter and Taure's canon magic document/analysis are great to dive into as well.

            Short fics/oneshots aren't in the same category and aren't really comparable, but there are also a ton of one-shots that can very much hone in on and develop a single idea: Cauterize, one about Harry using the Resurrection Stone and falling prey to it. The landscape is so vast, especially if you're looking for a specific subset. People who like HPMoR generally like the well-written super/munchkin-type fics, which exist in abundance, i.e. Harry Gets Motivated, The Greatest Minister of Magic. Or fics that focus more on Voldemort, like There is Nothing to Fear, which the author posted about here on r/rational.

            I also greatly enjoy fanfiction more for the interesting ideas it brings up, so I have a soft spot for fics like 0800-Rent-a-Hero or Percy Take the Wheel, which both look at characters in a new way and introduce/vastly expand on magic while still making it "feel" like it fits in the world.

            The aforementioned Nightmares of Future Past is basically apocryphal (IMO hasn't aged all that well), Isolation is a more recent popular fic. HPMoR is still great, and is actually complete in addition to being edited, but it's also good to read other stuff in the genre rather than just saying it's better than literally any Harry Potter fanfiction. I think there will certainly be people who will read all this other stuff and still consider HPMoR the best, especially on this sub, but that's far from the general consensus.

              i thought about this all day at work (slow day) and decided it basically comes down to different definitions of what readers want/expect in terms of harry potter fanfiction.

              1. just stories set in the harry potter universe; in this case hpmor is somewhere in the top .01 percent but not at the top. i would put life and times first, if pressed. a long journey home second. stages of hope perhaps third. i actually think the vast majority of this category is taken up by pre-canon stories by people like cgner and whoever wrote the shoebox project, who have an actual writing style.

              2. or is the goal to extract real actual "literature" (in the vaguest sense)? because if so, hpmor is just about the only thing that even qualifies. i am not comparing hpmor to tolstoy; that is not what i mean by literature. it's probably the wrong word. i am commenting on the fact that of all the people i know who don't care about harry potter and don't live on the internet and are "serious readers," etc -- *some of them sat down and read all of methods when i mentioned it to them*. if i sent them stages of hope afterward they would be completely nonplussed, despite the fact that it is also grammatical, has a tighter plot, and doesn't have any obvious shortcomings like methods does. stages of hope is certainly a more enjoyable story.

              the plain fact is that hpmor is in a different category. it's a category that i value more (and r/rational values more, and people who aren't mostly teenagers on the internet tend to value more), so it's... better. for a given definition: the second one. if i had to try to quantify why it's better, which is always a disastrous endeavor for opinions, i would say it's got more going on under the hood than fanfiction is supposed to. there are thematic elements, big ideas and fascinating plot points that just aren't present in "normal" fanfiction, even the best. this is what makes it worth spending time to read in sort of the same way tolstoy is worth spending time to read, although that's a comparison that will no doubt get me in trouble.

              my original point was about the contents of r/rational/top though. most of that is crap because people on r/rational will accept subpar writing quality if the characters think like they think, often *ad absurdum*. this is different from the upper range of harry potter fanfiction, which is definitely superbly written, just suffers from a category error.

            HPMOR is amazing at it's best, kinda decent on average and terrible at its worst. The whole thing is in dire need of polishing, but it still manages to be a masterpiece despite that. Also, HPMOR is not the gold standard of quality rational fic. It was the first rational fic and it began the genre, but if you're looking for a gold standard it might make more sense to read Luminosity or Pokemon: the Origin of Species. I will note that Luminosity is better written than Twilight, and yet Twilight is on book shelves while luminosity is not.

            As for barriers to entry, being at all interested in rational fiction is a huge barrier to entry. Most people don't know the genre exists, and even when they do it's a really hard genre to write in, and many people probably are hesitant to share their work because their attempts at rational fic don't hold up when analyzed by people on this sub.

              Rational fiction is not really a genre though. There are quite a few books that are published under the sci-fi or fantasy genre that are often recommended here.

      a third comment, because this is really interesting to think about. subreddits are *so good* at assembling related content that they crowd everything else out (people tell me twitter is similar). i frequent sports subreddits because they actually save me time and effort despite the hours i spend reading them. it’s like the netflix algorithm was applied directly to me, for baseball, and the result was that i never have to go to espn.com or sports illustrated or whatever, ever again. those were imperfect sources of knowledge/news/data, but the sports subreddits aren’t.

  But maybe no? Wine snobs, AFAIK, both won't even touch not-fancy wine, and (stereotypically) judge wine not on quality but on cost/rarity.

  I mean a lot of what characters in fiction do is pretty stupid.Most readers don't care that much about that kind of thing and will suspend heir disbelief and pretend it makes sense.And writing the kind of intelligent characters we care about is more difficult , and most people don't really care.The same thing for writing settings that make sense .

  So of course most fiction is not optimized for that kind of thing.

  We should expect most fiction to have characters acting dumb in ways and stories that don't make sense.Complaining about how specific pieces of fiction don't cater to your specific taste doesn't have to mean you are looking down on people that like that kind of fiction.But it does usually come off as that.

  Like [ArgentStonecutter](https://www.reddit.com/user/ArgentStonecutter) said there are people that care about about physics accuracy in SF .

  Different communities have different tastes in fiction .People like to find people whith similar tastes ,complain about the aspects of fiction that they don't like , and write things that are more optimized for their specific tastes.Snobbishness seems to be about thinking your tastes your tastes are "better" in some people than everybody else's

  .Intelligence has much higher status than orbital mechanics , so complaining about it probably comes up as more snobbish.And some people probably do look down on  other communities  of fiction but ,as you said , most people here are  nice.

  I suspect rational fiction by virtue of trying to make stuff whith smarter characters is always going to look snobbish , regardless of the actual snobbishness(Not sure if that's even a word) of the people writing it.

  The same whith any attempt to make stories better for an specific audience that looks like it's  about some kind of general quality of the story.

  The zombie thing its making fun of how crazy people usually act in zombie stories.Its not really about making fun about people that like that kind of zombie story.

  The writers of zombie stories are usually trying to make thematic points about humanity and things like that.

  They aren't trying to write what a sensible approach to the situation would look like.

  The same way the writers of a lot of "hard" scifi aren't  really trying to make it that accurate.

  So its not necessarily looking down to them either.

  A bit is probably an understatement.

  But it's not so bad in small bursts, and the stories themselves can be really good. I have a lot of gripes about HPMOR, but I followed along with it as it was being released (from ~2012 onwards). I enjoyed Luminosity, and I thought The Waves Arisen had its share of highs and lows. I've been a fan of Mother of Learning for well over half a decade, now, but more from being a fan of nobody's Naruto fanfic. 

  But if I didn't come back here for the recent discussion threads, I wouldn't have gotten into Worth the Candle or Alexander Wales' other works like Metropolitan Man, or A Practical Guide to Evil, which are three works I've enjoyed immensely.

  There's also something to be said about exposing yourself to different styles of tropes/writing over time. I love to read. I've had two or three phases where I basically tried to down everything in r/HFY, which itself is a subset of sci-fi fics- there was an EY story linked from there called Three Worlds Collides, which effectively led me back to this sub just a few weeks ago. I've had a few focused phases with fanfiction from several different fandoms, a few phases focused on more traditional fantasy or mystery books, a few phases where all I read was manga and Japanese light novels, and a few phases that branched out to light/web novels from Korea and China. So even the stuff that's solidly middle-of-the-road here can be fun to read because it feels fresh/creative.

  The kind of thing you're describing, like cutting Ron and Hagrid from HPMoR, is definitely one of the things that turned me off HPMOR on a second reading. The snobbiness and whatnot bothered me a lot less when I was a young teenager, less emotionally intelligent and less critical of its faults. I already wasn't a fan of many of the author tracts, though, and while I didn't agree with much of su3su2u1's rant on HPMoR, it brought up a large number of valid points/problems I had with the story.

  I've noticed that some of the community as a whole seems to treat rationalism as a sort of religion, and things that don't adhere to it are often treated as 'lesser' rather than different. There's a certain atmosphere of superiority, though it's rarely direct or obvious in individual posts. Obviously rationalism has been a big part in many of your lives, but some treat it as gospel, to the point of alienating others.

  Some of the community seems to be made up of people entirely unable to enjoy non-rational media, and that bleeds into a lot of the content the community consumes. Furthermore, some enjoy content exclusively BECAUSE it's rational, with no regard to quality, pacing, or anything else that traditionally good fiction is built on. There's nothing *wrong* with that, but some of the praise/criticism I see for certain (off-site) fictions is almost jarring. It's important to remember that being rational does not mean objectively good, which some of the community seem to forget at times.

  I'd very much be interested in an official stickied survey on the demographics present on the sub, because this community feels like a few *very* specific types of people. Hell, I'd even like to see a Myers Briggs Test (Not as a scientifically valid test, but just to compare to the general population).

  /r/rational is a cool community that I spend a lot of time in, I'd hate to see it become (more of?) an echo chamber.

  You realize in HPMOR Ron becomes a significant part of Hermoine's army later on, yes?

  Anyways, every community inherently has a sense of pride in itself. People in the community "get it" and people outside the community don't. This applies to everything from gun owners to shippers to us. The only difference is that since our community is literally dedicated to the idea that fiction should be written smartly, about smart characters, the usual pretense that we don't *really* think we're better than everyone else is that much harder to maintain. After all, the fact that this subreddit exists implies that the fiction we like is the exception, not the rule. And it is.

  I dunno how to end this comment. I guess I'll just say that I, at least, do unironically think that I'm smarter and have better taste than most people, and I like this subreddit because it appears to contain lots of people who aren't most people. If that makes me a snob, then I guess that's my cross to bear.

    Yes, and HPMoR is a bit more nuanced than "everyone else is an idiot". That doesn't mean HPMoR isn't snobbish, or that Ron's treatment isn't part of a larger problem.

    (And to speak bluntly, I hate that kind of arguing. Oh, the story says X in chapter Y! That proves you're **wrong**, which you would clearly know if you paid any attention to the story instead of complaining on forums!)

      Finding Ron useless is a time honoured tradition among all the fanfiction communities I've ever had any familiarity with. His up there with Jar-Jar Binks to be honest. 

      I've seen this complaint about how ratfic is for dweebs who are too full of themselves a lot but nearly everywhere in the internet is full of people who love to hear themselves talk so I don't really understand it. Snobbery happens less here than anywhere else that talks seriously about fanfiction. Mostly I think because there aren't as many actual fans.   

      In particular I remember how someone complained about the elevator scene in worth the candle where the author explains how elevators work and how the cable is connected to the top. The argument was that since nobody could find this interesting in and of itself the only possible reason to include it was to show off. Thus confirming that ratfic is written by pseudo-intellectuals. This guy seemed entirely serious and nobody disagreed. 

      Only reason I've ever found ratfic could be controversial is that a lot of it is built on the scary idea that if you never wondered what goes on in a college ethics class you're probably not a good person which I suppose could make people feel threatened the same way vegans do.

        I get where you're coming from! Like, a lot of this thread is turning into a political debates, like "X isn't true because I have examples of not-X here, here, and here", but really, it's not that black-and-white.

        Rational fic, like all fanfic genres, has its pitfalls and creeping problems, and an overfocusing on "I am too smart and people around me can't understand my genius" types of characters is one of them. Still better than the average Spacebattles thread.

      I think Harry is meant to have made a mistake with Ron, and that's why Ron is a big part why Hermione beats him later on. 

      The problem with a lot of HPMOR's criticism is that the story is kinda bad early on at showing that Harry is meant to be wrong and make mistakes very often, even if he's smug and the scene doesn't end with him being punished for it. Critics often just drop HPMOR before it becomes obvious that Harry's supposed to be kind of a dick and that his character development is related to that.

        Part of it is that it feels like the author changed course, rather than that this was the driving point of the scene in the first place.

          I'm inclined to disagree, mostly because I recall Yudkowsky has espoused the undervaluation of Hufflepuff values, and HJPV's pretty much doing the exact opposite of Hufflepuff at the beginning.

            Well, I've never read a statement of authorial intent on the matter, it's just that every time I read through HPMOR (about three times now) I note that the scene is lacking a lot of the things that would traditionally signal "protagonist is making a mistake here!", in terms of how the encounter is framed by the narrative. If I stopped reading there (as a fair number of people do) I would just assume that it was typical Ron bashing, because there's nothing in the text of the scene that suggests otherwise.

            (This is all true regardless of what the authorial intent was.)

              Is a story supposed to clearly show that the viewpoint character is currently wrong?

              When I read Worm as a teen I was following Taylor's thought process pretty uncritically, seeing a beat down girl with heroic ideals struggling against an increasingly unfair world. Only upon maturing myself and reading alongside various internet analyses I see just how flawed she is herself.

              Same goes with Luminosity, where I was cheering on the (in hindsight megalomaniac) protagonist with every step. I like that story *because* of the twist in the end forcing me to reevaluate the whole previous story. If there had been constant author commentary on just how wrong she is it wouldn't have had the same effect.

                It depends on the story and what it's trying to achieve. The risk that you run is that some people will just not understand the actual message, and go off with a warped view of what the work was attempting to say, sometimes with the opposite message the author intended. There are *still* a bunch of Taylor fans who didn't actually pick up on a lot of her characterization (and some more fans who see that characterization as positive, which is a separate issue).

                I suppose you could argue that in HPMOR there's plenty of impetus for a re-evaluation due to later events, and the Ron-bashing is meant as part of set up for that ... but it *still* feels like having your cake and eating it too, in a way that doesn't really work for me.

                (It's a fairly common problem with villain protagonists and anti-heroes that the cool thing about them is how they violate norms and do things that are beyond the pale, but the justification for why it's not just revenge porn or a dark power fantasy is that it's nominally condemned.)

                Also, in that particular example Draco (who Harry describes as the son of wizarding Darth Vader) agrees with him on ignoring Ron, which I'd definitely consider signaling it was the wrong choice anyway.

          Yeah, I got the same sense. It seemed like those scenes were intended to be read straight, at least early on. Maybe I'm being too harsh on EY here and should give him the benefit of the doubt---but he *did* write that rambling Facebook post about how people who think Harry's a snob are just having an irrational reaction based around an emotion he is biologically incapable of feeling.

          Plus, if Harry being a total dick *is* a result of EY trying to write a relatable character for nerds (as opposed to a literary failure of not adequately demonstrating in-text why Harry is wrong)... Well, I think it partially explains why HJPEV's character development is so incomplete---I mean, is he really a substantially different person by the book's end?

            The facebook post was about his conversation with Minerva, which was pretty bad to the point he had to edit it down, I agree there. But it was about standing up to authority or not caring about it, status pushing or something like that. It wasn't related to what we're talking about.

      I don't see it as a problem, is the point. Whether the "it" in question is "sometimes authors make jokes" or "enjoying smart writing makes you seem like a snob to idiots." Both those things are simply inevitable, so I try to take them in stride.

  You might be mixing up rational fiction and rationalist fiction, both of which are parts of this subreddit. Rational fiction isn't necessarily about rational or smart characters, just a world that works according to rules.

  Haha, of course! Any individual who thinks of themselves as intelligent will, to varying extent, come off as snobbish. Now what about a community which is built around people who like characters who are intelligent and know it?
