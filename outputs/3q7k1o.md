## [BST] You have a billion dollars and 30 days to spend it. What do you do?

  Buy stocks with all the money. Then sell those stocks five minutes later at a 0.01% loss or gain. 

  Then go to a financial planner and put your 1.001 billion or 999.99 Million to work.

  I'd probably get in touch with Elon Musk and be like "hey, so I've got a billion dollars burning a hole in my pocket, can I help you space?" With that much money to throw in, I might be able to get a seat on the SpaceX board and help oversee how the money gets spent. BFR and MCT get made even sooner, Mars colony gets built faster, humanity gets into space earlier making us that little bit more resistant to Death-by-asteroid. Or if I can help allocate some of those funds within SpaceX, help kickstart asteroid mining and orbital manufacturing. Nothing like sipping champagne on my spin gravity orbital shipyard while building the first large scale interplanetary transport ships.

  Endow a foundation dedicated to space development. There are other things that perhaps have higher value -- AI, cryonics, life extension -- but nothing that has as high a payoff and as much certainty of achieving the payoff. Asteroid mining, space colonies, solar power satellites...it's all either engineering or research, not basic science. The other things I mentioned are very much basic science.

  It seems like private enterprises are already solving the space race problem, so I would split in four parts:

  - 10m to MIRI.
  - 100m to SENS.
  - 290m to GiveWell's top choice.
  - 600m to XPrize to fund a bunch of prizes. Some governance is necessary to ensure the prizes don't become bad incentives (i.e. promote values misaligned with humanity's).

  Assuming I cannot arrange to move the money in a circle back to me and must abide by the *spirit* of that:

  I would spend weeks researching, brainstorming and outsourcing research into what causes would most appeal to myself. This is where it gets hard, because I don't exactly know where a billion would do the most good. Feeding Africa? No. Curing diseases? No. Give it all to MIRI? ...No. Probably. I'll do the research honestly, but I don't know programming, and I have no way of evaluating the expected return on giving a billion dollars to MIRI. I'm obviously not going to give a billion to the political party I'm active in, because they are so far from optimized it makes me sad. If I can set my family up with no debt and a few tens of thousands in travelling around the world, I'll do that, because that's pocket change and allows me to focus on Noble Stuff. Cryonics? Well, I have high hopes, but even assuming I can turn up on my favourite living people's doorstep and convince them to let me pay to have them frozen when they die, that's extremely expensive time wise, and I think when Cryonics finally pays off, if ever, having a few dozen people like Noam Chomsky revive will not be enough to make a very great political impact. I'm leaning toward anticipating a techno volatile future. I also cannot use my billion to assassinate 'bad guys', because I have no idea at all where to find reliable assassins, and looking for them would only risk getting me into a situation where I cannot spend the money. I'm not American, so I cannot easily spend money on bribing US politicians, although I will of course research this. I similarly cannot use the billion to buy Sanders the presidentship.

  So the answer is, I would not spend much money until I had done research. I would buy an absolutely fabulous laptop, and I would lock myself in my room and spend most of the time on the Internet. What I would do at the end of the month I do not know.

    Spend a billion on creating and optimizing your own \^_^

      Unfortunately a billion isn't enough, or else Trump wouldn't be running as a Republican.
