  Bonus content: [this poster](http://fav.me/ddjmzc0) I've made for the upcoming arc. I stick to vector art because I'm not that good at actually *drawing*, like, with *pencils* and stuff.

    Huh...well that's a thing.

    Looks cool, but I gather things won't go well for our POV characters.

  Fake dragon balls, huh? Hadn't thought of it before, but is seems like an obvious plan in hindsight. Combined with the ability to hide the balls you already own, we're really stepping up the information warfare aspect. 

  The dragonballs are interesting in how different numbers mean different things. Seven is the win condition, then you can just make your wish and be done with it. With one you can't make a wish, but neither can anyone else. In having more than one but less than seven, the only real advantage is that you can store them separately for redundancy in case one location is compromised, but it might also be just as good to keep them in one place with Max security. 

  Meaning, the instruments might just want to wait for the enemy to gather up the balls first, waiting until they're gathered before hitting one spot with all their might. The alternative is splitting up and hitting many of those spots fast, when most of them will be traps and ambushes that will sap your forces.

  Was nervous when the box showed up that it was the instruments who had thought to deploy fakes. Phew

  Huh who even is sherry?

    Original character, I introduced her in chapter 17. When Muten took in Goku and Krillin in canon he asked them to go find a cute girl who would live with them as "payment" for his teachings. In canon they found Lunch. In this version, it was only Krillin, and Sherry is the woman he brought back. She's a prostitute from South City who took living with Muten and occasionally indulging his voyeurism as a long-term, if unusual, job.

      WHAT?! She is ORIGINAL? I was 100% sure there was such a women living with Muten in Kama-house! The blonde one.... in the canon anime... ah, the canon one is Lunch. Maybe it makes sense.
      ```

        The canon one is Lunch, who would change hair colour and personality when sneezing. She was alluded to by Shenlong, when he told Bulma about making a magical construct human some time in the past whose descendants were still around. Sherry is a different person.
        ```

          >The canon one is Lunch, who would change hair colour and personality when sneezing. 

          I just found a reference to her in chapter 8

          >!Since he wanted some variety in his relationship, she had not just one personality, but <em>two</em>, and would change hair colour whenever she switched to help him keep track. !<

          Yay, I didn't spot it earlier, during first read

      It looks like they beat you to making a dragon ball OC named sherry
