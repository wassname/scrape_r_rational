## [MK][META] We (as a community) discover a poster posting hypothetical questions about powers actually has those powers in real life. How do we manipulate them into doing our bidding?

### Post:

Let's say the power is something fairly generic, and not too powerful. Say, "can sense the emotional states of all people in a 1000m radius of themselves, and has an attendant sub-power to allow them to keep track of all those people and emotions, regardless of how many there are."

Oh, and an attendant question: if we can get that person under our thumb, what would we have them do?

  You don't. 

  You help them become and stay a productive and functional member of society. If there is one empowered person, they are not likely unique going forward. As long as they are not a wolrdbreaker, the most important thing is to set the precedent of how such folk are treated. If they are a potential wolrdbreaker we want them stable and happy for our own good.

  Rational altruism all the way.

    This sounds risky as fuck. The amount of positive change and breakdown prevention that can be done by being friendly on reddit seems far too small. This guy is an existential threat. Doing the "right" thing and hoping for the best is not an option.

      I have the skills to be a supportive friend. I don't have the skills to mentor and develop an alpha mutant equivalent. There is a reason they made Prof-X a mind-god.

  Easy become friends with them. Then ask for favors. See if I could have him somehow transfer or awaken any powers in me.

  As for how to exploit a person with that ability fuck if I know. To be honest a person that could sense emotional states would never be manipulated by anyone with less than perfect emotional control. Best idea is just to be that persons friend.

  Assuming I could get him to do what I said there's not really much I could do with empathy (which is the power you are proposing). The person with the power could probably rise really high in politics and with practice could be unnaturally charismatic. I could help him rise to power which would benefit me quite a bit. Assuming of course I wanted to push him in the political power direction, which I would avoid at all costs, politicians that cannot effectively read minds are scary enough as is.

  I'd probably just tell him to become a motivational speaker or something. I'd have a friend that gives great advice and could get women in bed easier than James Bond. I could tag along and get all the hot women I want with minimal effort. And in the end that's all that really matters right?

    Indeed.  We shall achieve our goals through the power of... FRIENDSHIP!

  The type of people that post to this sub are less than likely to be manipulable by people they hardly know. In this scenario, the individual in question probably has very good ideas about what they want to happen and how they can learn to go about doing it in an effective manner. Our community has a foundation in inoculating people against manipulation, by others and themselves.

  Also, the "attendant sub-power" is more useful than the primary power. However, that primary power would allow the individual to see straight through the type of bullshit you'd be pulling if you ever were identifiably in-range.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  If we, as a community figure it out, wouldn't that person also know, as they are a part of the community?

  Even if they don't, how long would that last?  Someone would object to our plans to manipulate the person, and tell them.
