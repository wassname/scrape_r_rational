  >Of all the broad style/tone genres, I think that comedy is the worst fit for rational fiction, though it's an element in much of the "rational canon".

  I've thought a lot about humor in Rational Fiction and I tend to agree.

  Most humor seems to come from a variation of surprise, where an absurdity reshapes an unremarkable reality that otherwise might have gone unquestioned. In some cases this is a bit of observational cleverness - something otherwise conventional *isn't* taken for granted and that reveals the necessary absurdity - but usually humor's just dramatic irony: The characters don't know what's going on and the audience knows better. Reaction to the latter is some variation of a cheerful internal, "Oh no!"

  Although much of the latter (and even the former) are pretty shallow, there's no reason they must be. Intelligent, rational people are forced to act on insufficient knowledge with insufficient resources all the time. Understanding the ways that rationalist and scientific methods can, and do, stumble is every bit as valuable as admiring the ways they succeed.

  Where that gets in trouble is on the audience end of dramatic irony. They have to understand what's about to happen, or we're just watching the protagonist fumble. Sometimes entertaining and enlightening, but not usually funny.

  Observational cleverness is more in-line with the needs of Rational Fiction, and so we get cute references, witty puns, defied tropes, and (as mentioned) deconstruction of world-building oddities. Satisfied smiles and nods rather than a lot of laugh-out-loud madness.

    Have you tried reading a story called HPMOR?  It contains a lot of humor (see e.g. Ch. 5) and is widely considered to be ratfic.

    Humor is difficult and good humor is rare, but there's not much special or additional difficulty for a humorous author finding places to express it in ratfic.  It's true that differing perspectives and unshared information are often key, but what's antirational about that?

    I'd consider Terry Pratchett to be a counterexample as well.

    I would disagree on some points. It's hard to write a rationalist as a protagonist in a comedy, but there are some ways rational fiction can intersect with comedy.

    1) Jokes used to demonstrate irrationality on what not to do:

    * The importance on testing: "Of course you needed to test the edge-cases in the simulator you stupid fools! Now that device you sold for millions has been given to the president who is using it on national TV! Now guess what failure they are talking about on channel 1!!!!"

    * Planning fallacy: "Of course I'll finish this paper in time. It's not like I've been late with this paper the last four times this happened! Wait..."

    2) Jokes to make biases and techniques more memorable (like a study aid):

    * Confirmation Bias: Of course what you see and expect turns out to be right every time, you're god! Just ignore or misinterpret all of the evidence telling you otherwise.

    * Planning for the worse: If you don't assume the worst case scenario, the gremlins will make sure things go FUBAR just to screw with you.

    3) Funny solutions to a problem that are also rational or genius. I sometimes try to be more creative by asking myself what the 'funny' or 'cool' answer to a problem would be:

    * Have bratty kids who won't behave going in a car trip with you? Bring a bag of candy and every time they misbehave, throw a piece of candy out the window.

    * Want free alcohol at a party? Tell people you've never been drunk!

    All right, feedback.  Here goes.

    * I liked the idea of a creator arguing with his non-sentient creations.  The comedian/straight-man dynamic is good when it works.  The pronunciation joke, especially.
    * As someone who knows just enough about DBZ to realize that that's the story being referenced, it seems like half of the references were going over my head.
    * "Rubber duck debugging" went over my head, and I'm a programmer.  A line or two explaining it would probably be helpful.
    * The technobabble gets a bit dense, especially towards the end of the lecture.
    * I like the ending, where the doctor completely misses the point about intelligence and obedience.

    I think the main way you could improve upon this is to make it snappier.  A comedian/straight-man routine is much more back-and-forth; it doesn't work so well when the comedian is explaining everything in detail.  For the Ur-Example, [Who's on First](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg), it's bang-bang-bang all the way through.

    Oh, and well done on the mad scientist character.  I don't know if that's an actual DBZ character or an original character, but I liked him.

      >I'm still a bit confused: was it [Spoiler]?

      Yes.  That was the intention.

      >The dialogue in the beginning didn't feel entirely natural.

      There's one line there ("I'm sorry," etc.)  that I agree doesn't match the rest, but, other than that, I don't see what you're seeing.  I get that describing what exactly "doesn't feel natural" is difficult, but are you able to be any more specific?

      > I think the whole first scene could be significantly shortened. 

      Agreed.  I wanted to set it up so that the second interview scene paralleled the first, but that didn't work out beyond the first couple of lines (and then there was a third one, as Jack, that got cut entirely).  But yeah, I shouldn't have let a scene that's just tangentially related to the overall plot drag on for two pages.

      >I probably would have understood the story better if I were more familiar with the comics.

      Possibly, but maybe not.  I was cribbing more off of the movies and [B:TAS](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/BatmanTheAnimatedSeries) than the comics.

      Thanks for the feedback!
