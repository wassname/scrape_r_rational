  More like:

  You, Kant, turn ethics into a set of correct, unambiguous rules. (I'll see myself out.)

  This is like the uncanny valley of this argument for me. If this was an ingroup production I'd be more irked by the wrong parts, but as an outgroup production, well, they've got the framing right, and certainly it's better than ‘the real risk of artificial intelligence is that it's too dumb’.

  Purely judging as a skit, it felt a bit awkward, having the AI be an incredibly stereotyped human speaking a bit robotically, and the conversations not really feeling like people talking as much as just signposting what position they represented.

  Acting is nice. Writing could use some work.

  How honored should those three stooges consider themselves that the superintelligence deemed the three of them in particular worthy of an explanation of what it was planning to do?

    Explaining it to them added some value for its obscure goals, possibly infinitesimally small, maybe incredibly big.
    ```

- u/xartab:
  ```
  This is actually a decent take on the subject, for once!
  ```

  Fun sketch but I wouldn't say it's rational fiction at all
  ```

  The ethicist's lines reminds me of the expert's in this:
