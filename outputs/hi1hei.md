## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  There's an older scifi short I'd love to find, about a time-traveler official who yoinks people (at the end of their lives, I think leaving a double?) so they can stand trial in the future for their crimes. Starts, I think, with Jefferson and his slaves?  


  Feels topical, but I haven't been able to find it.

    If you don't mind a self rec, I wrote 'The Fifth Defiance', which I think meets your criteria.  Here is a link!

    ```
    Shyamalan's *Unbreakable* film trilogy. There's always a doubt as to how real the powers actually are, which is sort of the point- what is the limit of human potential? Subtle, moving, and sometimes downright terrifying.

    *Unbreakable*: A man becomes the only survivor of a train wreck, and this feat comes to the attention of an eccentric comic book curator.

    *Split*: Young girls get kidnapped by a man with multiple personalities. Said personalities are all struggling to understand the meaning of one dangerous personality in him... The protagonist is one of the girls, a loner, survival-minded.

    *Glass*: Brings together the heroes and villains of the previous two for a curious psychological showdown.

    *Unbreakable* has possibly my favourite villain but can be slow. *Split* is the most accessible of the three, and probably the best. *Glass* is a mixed bag, but I thought it had something to it.

    I'd be interested in reading some, superheroes always irked me and always will. They make no sense, economically, or socially. I'm sure you can find some comments of mine criticizing it around the sub. 

    &#x200B;

    And no, because I know somebody will say it, the argument that superheroes decrease crime rates doesn't make sense economically. There's a thing called opportunity cost, and yada yada. Superheroes and vigilantes in general make no sense and would serve no purpose other than being cool and aggrandizing the ego of the heroes themselves.
    ```

    - u/SoylentRox:
      ```
      Agree.  Plus the fundamental problem with vigilantism is as unprofessional, biased police with too much individual power, they would commonly kill and assault innocent people.  There wouldn't be many of these easily identified straightforward crooks in a superhero world.

      In real life if a criminal decides to rob a convenience store or commit a rape or mugging in a back alley, most of the time the crook is assessing the risks.  They generally won't do such a crime if there is a hundred percent chance of getting caught - it's why the convenience stores with an armed police officer standing outside don't generally get robbed.

      If superheroes with super hearing are patrolling your city it's a similar thing.
      ```

      - u/Wireless-Wizard:
        ```
        Obviously a Superman-tier hero should reduce crime significantly.

        But even Superman can't be everywhere 24 hours a day. You would need a squadron of Supermen to make it a 100% chance of getting caught. One Superman and a bunch of A- or B-tier heroes still allows for criminals to get away with it.
        ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          Interesting point, at what break point does Superman stop all crime in the city? He doesn't actually need to catch 100% initially, just suppress crime until it gets below his catch capacity.

          Say he can stop 100 crimes a day, as a criminal how many daily crimes in the city would you need to feel like you can get away with your own crime? Obviously > 100. 1,000 a day? That's not taking into account that Superman is removing 100 criminals every day, which would effect the averages if repeat crimes are common. Even if you think you will get away with the crime you will have to come to terms with the fact that the only reason you didn't get caught was luck that Superman didn't pick you.

          I think Superman would very quickly shut down violent crime within his hearing range even if he could only catch a small percentage initially. I would imagine removing repeat offenders and the threat of capture would create a feedback loop driving cases he can catch to 0 over time. Although crimes of passion would muddy this and potentially give cover to other crimes...
          ```

    - u/LifeIsBizarre:
      ```
      I've always seen them as a deterrent and weapon to be used against those with powers who don't want to toe the line.  
      Yes, you could just have a well funded group of non-powered people looking after the city, but when a guy shows up who can cut guns in half with his mind it might be a good idea to have that weirdo who can shoot fire on your side.
      ```

      - u/fassina2:
        ```
        Most governments don't allow people to own firearms. Just extrapolate that and imagine what governments would do to people with super powers.. 

        There are many points I have against this. But just think for a second that people with super powers existed, and that they don't just magically show up in the 50s thanks to author fiat but that they've been around since long ago. 

        Do you think we'd have democracies ? I'd imagine a society with selectively bred supers that actively hunt and eliminate any super that's born outside or leaves their power structures, to be much more likely.
        ```

        - u/LifeIsBizarre:
          ```
          Assuming superpowers are genetic and not spontaneous I think you would be right. I was thinking more from the 'Things are almost normal, but occasionally someone has a lab accident or gets hit by a meteor, or drinks a 30 year old soda and gets super powers' type of world. Somewhere where superpowers wouldn't be predictable and would be hideable from the world.  
          I think reading a story regarding a world with genetically reproducible superpowers entrenched throughout history would be pretty damn interesting. When would the discovery of new countries have occurred when you have people capable of flight? Would technology even progress much past the stone age? Someone more creative than me should take this and run with it.

    It's on hiatus currently because the author wanted to write a fantasy story, but promised to return to it.  Superpowers are super prevalent and a large part of its setting is how police with superpowers are preferred over vigilantes because vigilantes did not end up working out.

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    J Clevenger's Training in Necessity does superheros run by a centralized organization, with a lot of the focus on the training and organization of superhumans, or the widespread political fallout of having superhumans running around.
    There's a few mentions of vigilantes, but only to be contrasted poorly with the organized approach.

    Brilliance by Marcus Sakey. Superpowers are genetic, recent and only mental enhancements.

    The New Humans might fit. Superheroes/villains do exist, but it's more like a military / terrorists thing.

    Pith. Supervillains/crimelords don't put on a costume. 

    The Menocht Loop? It's an industrialized fantasy setting, the most powerful poeple are generally military/police, most people don't have powers.

  Much of ratfic can be seen as a kind of "competence porn". The protagonist tends to be smart and hard-working, driven to pursue their goals. For example:

  - Zorian from MoL
  - Harry from HPMOR
  - Amaryllis from WTC
  - Cat from PGTE
  - Red, Blue, Leaf from PTOOS

  That's a large part of why it appeals to me. Do you know more fics like that?

      ```

      - u/Roxolan:
        ```
        *Fleep* is complete, and pretty short. 

        (Interesting fact: It was originally a newspaper-style comic strip. The author had to have a cliffhanger on every final panel, and you can sense his struggle sometimes...)

        The two other works I've read from this author are [Meanwhile](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/7229730) and [Demon](http://www.shigabooks.com/index.php?page=001) (also complete). 

        *Meanwhile* is a delightfully creative and technically impressive book. 

        *Demon*... well I have a love/hate relationship with it. It's pretty rational in *some* ways (think "sharpened Hufflepuff bones"), and offers intriguing and mostly fair puzzles. But it also has some *massive* idiot balls, and lots of gratuitous grossness ("see? I'm not afraid to show you sharpened Hufflepuff bones! SEE THEM?! LOOK AT THEM BONES!!!"), and every single character is an evil psychopath. Sometimes it's so outrageous it works as comedy, sometimes... not. Content warning for violence and explicit disturbing sex and assorted grossness.
        ```

        - u/LifeIsBizarre:
          ```
          Just finished binge reading demon in a little under 2 hours. Now I need to go let that settle in. Incoming weird dreams tonight guaranteed!   
          Thanks very much for the recommendation. Anything else you've found that isn't mainstream?

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Menocht Loop's main thesis is, basically, you can have all the power in the world but it won't do you any good if you don't know how to apply it. 

        The MC starts out with all the power, and gradually learns that it means less than you'd think.

      - u/ansible:
        ```
        It starts out as a fairly straight-up school adventure.  And then gets stranger and stranger.  With meta-conflict and metaphorical-not-a-metaphor conflict.  There are several sections where I don't quite understand what is going on.  It kind of reminds me of Worm, as far as the overarching plotline goes, as best as I can understand it.
        ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Some more examples, although they are less rational than the ones you've posted.

    * The Zombie Knight Saga has a protagonist that constantly tries to work and think hard to solve his problems, although he doesn't start off as competent.

    * Castle Kingside has a surgeon get transmigrated into a medieval world, and he is trying to uplift the society around him. It doesn't gloss over the R&D aspect of technology as some other uplift stories do, Dimitry faces difficulty reinventing stuff.

    The Wiz series by Rick Cook, published by Baen, is my competence porn:

    > It all began when the wizards of the White League were under attack by their opponents of the Black League and one of their most powerful members cast a spell to bring forth a mighty wizard to aid their cause. What the spell delivered was master hacker Walter Wiz Zumwalt. The wizard who cast the spell was dead and nobody—not the elves, not the dwarves, not even the dragons—could figure out what the shanghaied computer nerd was good for. But spells are a lot like computer programs, and, in spite of the Wiz's unprepossessing appearance, he was going to defeat the all-powerful Black League, win the love of a beautiful red-haired witch, and prove that when it comes to spells and sorcery, nobody but nobody can beat a Silicon Valley computer geek!

    Sample ebook chapters are available on Baen’s site.

    My favorite moment comes in one of the later books when he hops worlds back to Earth at the E3 show in Vegas. One booth is selling the ultimate in untraceable porn, which your boss is guaranteed not to find on your work computer: a program that algorithmically generates a porn still image from any file over 1MB and displays it without saving a file to the hard drive. Wiz asks how big the program’s executable file is, and they say it’s over 1MB. They feed it into itself, and the resulting porn image is both illegal in fifteen states and physically implausible.

      Oh good grief those things, I remember those! They're great fun fluff crack fiction, and I'll absolutely second the recommendation for that reason, but FWIW I'd be hard pressed to describe them as rational, or indeed particularly well-written for a published book (think grammar about on par with the average novelupdates translation).

      If you like them, though, you might also enjoy Scott Meyer's Magic 2.0 series - the first one is ["Off to be the Wizard"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00EF8Z32I) and they're actually pretty much the same thing but with more of the characters trolling each other more of the time.

  Any stories in which the main character becomes an unprecedenced expert or a pioneer in deeply esoteric, spiritual, highly abstract Soul-related, almost religious stuff in contrast to the mostly hard fantasy-esque, generic nature of the standard magical system of the setting? To use an analogy, the protagonist might be something of a philosophy/theology/literature major amongst the figurative crowd of STEM dudes. Examples (kinda spoilery, so I’ll black it out just to be safe):

  [The Games We Play by Ryuugi](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/rwby-the-gamer-the-games-we-play-disk-five.341621/) — >!all the archangel, Kaballah, Chakras, and mysticism shit in the late game. I loved the chapter-long philosophical siloloquies on the nature of soul, identity, and reality that took place in between shounen-esque action scenes. The contrast between a seemingly-hard, easily quantifiable concept like the Gamer powerset and some of the extremely abstract end-game skills like the Ohr Ein Sof, the Arcana, Et in Arcadia Ego was a treat!<. Actually, many of Ryuugi’s crossovers have this kind of hard/soft play, Arana and Prytaneum had some pretty nice descriptions of ‘godly’ or ‘spiritual’ stuff compared to the shounen anime nature of their original settings. 

  [Time Braid by ShaperV](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid) — >!the bright kami and demon shit, mental landscapes, the language of creation, the space between universes, the world-wide sealing fate manipulation sealing arrays drawn onto the sky, the aspects, the way chakra is portrayed when looked through the Byakugan, and so on!<.

  [Mother of Learning by nobody103](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/1/Mother-of-Learning) — >!all the end game unstructured magic, dimensionalism, soul magic, mind magic, and stuff!<.

  On the other hand, I wouldn’t use Pact or Unsong as an example, since *all* of the magic in there is mostly abstract and concept-based. What I’m searching for is specifically the *contrast* between hard fantasy standard baby stuff every wizard casts and the weird-ass freaking high-level abstract shit the protagonist might attempt to do.

  I’d much prefer fanfiction and webfiction/self-published Amazon/semi-amateur internet shit over older fantasy classics, but if it matches, I’ll take it.

    The hard part about these sorts of stories is they often take a while to get there.

    The only one I can think of that has really started to get there that you haven't mentioned is [Nanocultivation Chronicles: Trials of Lilijoy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/28254/nanocultivation-chronicles-trials-of-lilijoy) by Aetherial, which does that sort of "hard/soft contrast" you described (and they often feed into each other). It's a pretty rough start stylistically and writing style wise (due to, I think, an unfortunate, but intentional, choice by the author). However it is an awesome take on both the litrpg and cultivation genres, with really cool world building, and I think really well done.

    I think Delve may be going that way, but it's hard to tell at the moment.

    I didn't actually like the endgame of the 'games we play'. What it had right for hundreds of thousands of words was the pacing.

    It happens very very far into the Zombie Knight Saga, but we've gotten looks at the more mystical aspects of the world. For the most part, the superpowers from Reapers and Servants take the front stage, but as you get into the story you get more details of the world and the pockets of mysticism that still exist. 

    >!For example, we meet gods and people who ascended to their level with power different from Reapers/Servants. There are items with supernatural powers and lore. At the current chapters, we see zones of mysticism where time acts differently, and the power of soul takes precedence. And so on.

  Hi I'm looking for "realistic" Pokemon content with a focus on finding and catching rare Pokemon as well as training and evolving them. I love the world of Pokemon Origin of Species but would be more interested in finding/capturing/training Pokemon. Much of the content in that series is focused on teaching rational ideas or delving into Red's Physic powers, which, while I enjoy, takes away from the story/progression of the Pokemon. I enjoyed "Game of Champions." I couldn't get too far into "The Sun Soul" as it seemed less thought out/structured and the characters completely unbelievable in their response to the major event that happens at the beginning.
  ```

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    Your best and only bet is likely Pedestal, but it's, imo, not that great after the first arc or so.

    I'd love other recommendations of this type but they seem to be rare, possibly because pokemon media is not at all consistent in how pokemon behave and need to be trained.

  I read [Ben's Damn Adventure](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32411/bens-damn-adventure-the-prince-has-no-pants) over the weekend and it was fun - it's a system apocalypse story but in the /r/hfy vein. The basic concept is that humanity "won" a previous iteration of the system, so when we get shoved back in we're in New Game Plus mode. 

  Relevant to this subreddit, there's some interesting munchkinry of the main character's NGP perk - it's essentially an inventory, but it's a lot more diagetic than most, which leads to some cool interactions and (effectively) abilities.

    The best part of hpmor, far and away, was participating in the subreddit trying to figure out the plot as it was being written, which.. is unfortunately not replicable for this story any more.

      [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/) could tick several of the same boxes: it's not so much a device to explore rationality as non-human mindsets, but it is a supernatural mystery where the protagonists approach the investigation fairly competently, whatever other flaws they might have. 

      It's also got a pretty sizable community discussing it on /r/Parahumans, and is only on its second arc, so for anyone looking for an ongoing fandom near the beginning of a work it's a decent option.

  I've been reading [Going Native] (https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/going-native-dbz-dc-comics.789109/), a DC/DBZ light crossover. The premise is that the main character, Tarble, is a self insert of the author. And over the course of the story he "goes native" with the Saiyans, so to speak. By light crossover, I mean that only Frieza's empire and the saiyans are ported into DC. No Namekians and any of the especially ridiculous stuff that happens later on in the dbz series. 

  The story avoids almost all the pitfalls I normally see in self insert stories, because the human memories and instincts of the author are slowly overwritten by the brutality of typical saiyan life (hence the going native part). It's a fantastic look at the saiyan species and how they are developing from a population of 3,000 at the beginning of the story to more people later on. The author also does power levels pretty well, making Tarble gain power at an astonishing rate that still feels earned. Overall, I give the story a solid recommendation.

  As for requests, I'm still looking for stories with a protagonist that has a "tank" build. As in, they can regenerate stupidly fast, are very hard to damage, can take a beating, or any combination thereof. The focus must still be on them being able to take lots of damage. Some examples (that I've read):

  * Zac from Defiance of the fall, with his stupidly high endurance.

  * That gold guy from Mistborn second era, who can regenerate from decapitated heads, getting his body crushed, drowned, etc.

  * The protagonist from A Bad Name, which is a Worm/Gamer fanfic.

  * The protagonist from An Exercise in Stupidity, which is a rwby/Gamer fanfic.

    ```
    [The Hyperion Cantos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_Cantos) by Dan Simmons is not rational, but *man* is it good space opera. 

    Humanity has had its diaspora into the vastness of space - and then developed unlimited-range portals. So you have all these wildly different human cultures on different planets that are now literally one step apart. Tons of great world-building.
    ```

    - u/IICVX:
      ```
      Definitely seconding all four Hyperion books for irrational, grandiose space opera.

      Also, if you don't feel up to reading a four book epic, his stand-alone novel Ilium is very good too, and IIRC is lighter on the existential dread.
      ```

      - u/surt2:

        Ilium isn't standalone. It has a sequel called "Olympos"

    ```
    [Alastair Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alastair_Reynolds), generally - most of his books are fairly hard scifi space operas. Pushing Ice is a nice high-concept but self-contained novel. 

    There's also Iain M. Banks' [Culture series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_series), which IMO is one of the things that really informs the characterization of friendly hyper-intelligent AI in fiction.

    Less "space opera" and more "space as a metaphor for the age of sail", there's the [Quarter Share](https://www.amazon.com/Quarter-Share-Traders-Golden-Clipper-ebook/dp/B00AMO7VM4) series - it's basically slice of life on a sailing ship that's actually a space ship, with a dash of "capitalism, ho!". I don't think there's any combat until like the third book, and even then it's all hand-to-hand.

    I've never read a novel as striking as Bester's *The Demolished Man*. Power-hungry protagonist tries to get away with murder in a society governed by telepaths, beginning a cat-and-mouse struggle between him and a psychic cop. But he is haunted by visions of The Man With No Face..."*Looking. Looming. Silent. Horrible. Run...Run...*"

    Otherwise for novels, *Ender's Game*. Eminently re-readable classic.

    *Crest of the Stars*, a slow-moving space opera anime. Jinto, son of a politician who surrendered to the Abh empire, becomes Abh nobility and enters compulsory military service. He is soon caught up in the struggle between the authoritarian, genetically altered Abh and the democratic free humans. What is most interesting is the personal tone it takes. The struggle is more about the light and darkness of the individual than the galactic incidents that occur.
    ```

    - u/chiruochiba:
      ```
      I'd like to second the rec for *The Demolished Man*.

      It's not rational per se, but it plays with some fascinating ideas and has stellar scene-setting. Like most scifi stories from the 1950s, this book has an iconic style that makes it feel retrofuturistic in comparison to modern sensibilities. It's a fun read.

    In no particular order:

    - Vernor Vinge's Zones of Thought series, which starts with [A Fire Upon the Deep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep), which you may have heard of before from EY's [The Finale of the Ultimate Meta Mega Crossover](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5389450/1/The_Finale_of_the_Ultimate_Meta_Mega_Crossover)
    - Anything by Charles Stross, including [Accelerando](https://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/accelerando/accelerando-intro.html) and, with Cory Doctorow, [The Rapture of the Nerds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rapture_of_the_Nerds)
    - [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)) is a nice series of novels and a nice TV series.
    - Most things by Kim Stanley Robinson, but in particular [the Mars Trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy) and [Aurora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_(novel)). If you're into political thrillers, the [Science in the Capital](http://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/science-capital-trilogy) trilogy or omnibus are okay, as is [New York 2140](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_2140). _Red Moon_ I thought unfinished. If you'd like to get a look at Robinson's early style, [Icehenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icehenge) was pretty good, and featured themes that will be developed in his later works.
    - I recommend 1.5 Neal Stephenson books: [Anathem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathem), and the first two parts of [Seveneves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seveneves), up throught the Seven Eves are named. Don't bother with the third part; it's the first third of a different novel.
    - Poul Anderson wrote some great stuff, including swords-and-blasters books like the womanizing [Dominic Flandry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_Flandry) series and medieval [The High Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Crusade). The Flandry novels share a setting with [the many other works of Anderson's Technic History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poul_Anderson_bibliography#Technic_History), and today I learned that the excellent standalone novel [Orion Shall Rise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_Shall_Rise) is part of a series. [Tau Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_Zero) is no longer scientifically plausible, but was some nice hard scifi.
    - Ann Leckie's [Imperial Radch series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Leckie#Set_in_the_Ancillary_universe), consisting of the Ancillary trilogy, Provenance, and the short story [She Commands Me And I Obey](https://web.archive.org/web/20150321212448/http://www.strangehorizons.com/2014/20141110/commands-f.shtml) are all good.
    - Arkady Martine's [A Memory Called Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Memory_Called_Empire)
    - Ada Palmer's Terra Ignota series is a stupendous feat of worldbuilding like unto Neal Stephenson, except the author wrangles enough plots for seven different novels into one series, and makes it work. I will let the narrator introduce himself; [the first chapter is here](https://www.tor.com/2016/04/12/excerpts-ada-palmer-too-like-the-lightning-chapters-1-and-2/) and the content warnings in the title page are serious.

  I want to get into some large fanfic people on this subreddit are fawning over, but I don't have the time nor the emotional capacity to read several works at once or in quick succession. So I want to commit.

  By skimming the first chapter of some of the most commonly mentioned stories, I was left with two options:

  * *r!Animorphs: The Reckoning*

  * *Pokemon: The Origin of Species*

  Which of these two would you recommend more, and why?

  (If somebody wants to know my tastes, here are random assessments of works from this sub's wiki: 

  * I **really liked** *HPMoR* (and its fic *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie*), *The Metropolitan Man*, and all the short fiction stories from SSC;

  * I **generally enjoyed** *Friendship Is Optimal* and *Three Worlds Collide*;

  * I **found okay** *Mother of Learning*, *Luminosity*, and *The Waves Arisen*;

  * I **didn't like** *Time Braid*.

  Closing bracket.)

  - u/leadlinedcloud:
    ```
    This reply's a bit late, but I would strongly recommend The Reckoning. It explores the concepts of the original series, speeding up the plot of the original to get to the interesting parts fast and taking things to their logical conclusions. The characters are punished for their mistakes and the powers are satisfyingly exploited.     
    You don't need to have read the original series, everything is pretty self explanatory excusing a few things that would be surprising without foreknowledge of them.

  So this is a bit of an odd one, but I feel like some of you might enjoy the [KUSOMEGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KojTtZMZm4) books. 

  I highly recommend listening to the audiobook versions, but a text version can be found in the description, if you prefer.

  I wouldn't call it rational (not the first book anyway), but it does the "isekai light novel that is a deconstruction of isekai light novels" thing way better than most other stuff I've seen. Beyond that, the writing style just really resonates with me in a way that's hard to put into words.

  Also, if you start hating it at chapter four, >!don't worry. That cringeworthy nonsense was setup for stuff later on, not just pointless powerwank.!<

  EDIT: Also, trigger warnings, >!it's pretty NSFW. It doesn't have any actual explicit sex scenes (as far as I can remember), but it is pretty forwardly sexual. It also has a few slurs of various sorts here and there. I can vouch for the author not actually meaning anything by it, but take care if that sort of thing bothers you. Also TW for suicide, though the title of the video tells you about as much.!<

    [The Demon Lord's Lover](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20243/the-demon-lords-lover) is a really cute isekai romance. The world at first seems to be a generic isekai world, where the demon lord is defeated by the hero generation after generation, but the author does extra worldbuilding on it and makes it much better than it seems. The premise is that the mentor of the current generation of heroes falls in love with the current demon lord, and slowly they get together. Highly recommend.

  Any more recomendations for more stories like this? 

  Almost anything is fine (translated/manga/anime is fine too, but I probably read/watched most of them already and unfortunately none up to the quality of The snake report) and I am specifically after HUMANS reincarnated/transfered whatever into non-human bodies, (so not like Mud's mission where the MC is not actually human). 

  Also ideally one where the MC actaully does interact with the human population and is not just stuck in a dungeon the whole time or something. - I don't know what is so appealing to me about just reading the reactions of normal people to intelegent whatevers, and for some reason just the meaningless kindness of something which normally wouldn't do so makes me feel so happy.

    Fork This Life is like that. Really slow updates, but what's there is satisfying I'd say.

    Slime Tensei, although it kinda loses its charm later on.

    Kumo Desu Ga, Nani Ka? is like that. I'm not too far into it, but it's been shaping up to be pretty fun.

    Biomass Effects start off like that. It was really good when I read it a while back, but idk if you'd find it as good anymore. Some reviews I read of the latest chapters tell of some serious flaws.

    Tree of Aeons is like that, although the MC's thought process changes a lot.

    I've read the webtoon version up to chapter 150 or so, so I'm not sure how much these criticisms apply to the original webnovel.

    While it's entertaining, the uplift process felt overly streamlined, with implausibly short R&D timescales, at least until >!new witch powers are available to substitute for a machine shop and other prerequisites!<. 

    Additionally, the main character benefits a lot from low-hanging fruit without much satisfactory explanation of why no-one else has discovered them before. The largest ones are that >!no other groups seem to have made a systematic effort to use witches' abilities!<, >!the solution to witch deaths to their own magic as they come of age is something that anyone else could easily have stumbled upon just like the protagonist or even decided to test!<, and >!some witch power evolutions come very easily and don't seem like they required the scientific knowledge to achieve!<.

    I read this a while back (maybe a few years ago?) and ended up dropping this. There's a lot of exaggeration and oversimplification going on in the story. 

    The main issue I have is that everything comes way too easy to the MC. I got the impression that the world just wants him to succeed - if he needs a witch with a particular ability, she'll show up in a few chapters. If he needs to train an army, the men go from barely literate peasants to fully trained soldiers with a snap. There was too much "he got lucky" moments IMO.

  Any good harem stories? Worth the Candle is the only one that jumps to mind.
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Wake of the Ravager, sort of? It's not a deconstruction or reconstruction of harems, but it's a fun and satisfying look at a *barely* functioning one (where there's a polyamorous triad and a psychotic fourth wheel).

    The Demon Lord's Lover is a fluffy romcom with harems, where one of the main characters becomes a member of another main character's harem. It's a very idealistic world with well functioning harems, so take that as you will.

    Savage Divinity has a harem, and is slowly starting to get into harem dynamics, but I don't really know if I would recommend it. It's very long and has periods of very slow pace and almost-filler, but it's better than any other wuxia/xianxia so far with harems.

        It is in fact a thing if rare. The Demon Lord's lover below does it, "No Spacebattles, You are the waifu" has this as the main conceit of the storyline, and I've seen a couple more that I don't remember right now. It could be argued that this is how the Daily Grind handles it but the protagonists are fairly equal in terms of screen time.

  hi guys, I wanted to ask for some good fanfiction recommendations, as a general rule I can't stand people holding the idiot ball and I'm looking for a completed or regularly updating fiction of at least 500.000 words. I just recently started reading fanfiction because I used to find the idea of it unappealing but I started reading some Warhammer and GoT quests and that lead to me reading HPMOR, the aritmancer, fairy dance of death, etc and giving it an honest attempt, however navigating [fanfiction.net](https://fanfiction.net/) to find anything interesting is impossible and fucking disgusting... unless I'm missing something. I want to add that I really didn't like worm so please no worm fanfic.

  - u/chiruochiba:
    ```
    >at least 500.000 words

    That's a big ask. Even long, completed fanfics rarely reach that length. That said, here are some great ones:

    ---

    **[To the Stars](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7406866/1/To-the-Stars)** 

    (*761k+ words; ongoing*)

    The story is set in a far distant future of the deconstructionist magical girl anime *Puella Magi Madoka Magica*.

    Humanity has evolved into a post-scarcity, transhumanist civilization spread across multiple star systems and is now locked in an existential war against an alien threat. Magical girls form the backbone of humanity's military forces, their 'magic' providing a vital tactical edge against the technological superiority of the aggressors.

    The main character is a young girl who joins the war effort after she contracts to become a magical girl.

    (If you'd like to know more about the fic, the TVTropes article also has a good rundown: [link](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/ToTheStars))

    ---

    **[Beneath](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8293519/1/Beneath)** 

    (*1.6m+ words; ongoing*)

    This is an *Avengers* fanfic that diverges from canon after the Chitauri invasion failed and Loki was brought back to Asgard.

    Odin shoulders the heavy burden of pronouncing sentence on Loki. Presented with a choice between life imprisonment or a death sentence, Odin picks a third option: exile and a geas to restrict Loki's magic.

    The early parts of the fic mainly take place on Earth, but the author has constructed an epic plotline that spans multiple realms with intrigue, war, and the lurking threat of Thanos plucking the strings from the darkness beyond the Nine.

    [Luminosity](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/Luminosity), a rational *Twilight* reimagining, and its immediate sequel *Radiance* are complete at 438K. (Self-contained, no need to be familiar with the *Twilight* franchise.) If you add 64K worth of omake, you'll be right around the 500K mark. Note that *Radiance* is an integral part of *Luminosity* even though it has a different narrator. If you stop at the end of *Luminosity*, you will be left with a very different impression of the overall tone and the direction of the fic.

    [Dungeon Keeper Ami](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DungeonKeeperAmi) is a semi-humorous semi-rational cross between *Dungeon Keeper* and *Sailor Moon*. (Mostly self-contained.) Updates have been infrequent as of late, but it's sitting at 866K and has plenty of plot to keep you occupied for a while.

    In case you are not familiar with [Mother of Learning](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MotherOfLearning), it's one of the better known original rational fics. It's over 800K and was wrapped up earlier this year.
