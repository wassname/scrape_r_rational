  This is the one with the app developer, right?

  It's excellent compared to other RWBY SIs, and a top tier RWBY fic, but that doesn't really mean much. The protagonist gets waaaay too stupid/amoral by the end and it's just frustrating to watch. He doesn't even achieve anything by doing edgy stuff, the writer just put it there to get random drama.

  I think it's still worth reading because it's pretty good until that happens, though.

    He alienates a team that was on extremely good terms with him for zero tangible benefit and then spends like four chapters destroying his own rapport with his team over it. I get that the author is trying to portray the character as damaged or whatever, but I just couldn't stand it.

    I got that feeling around chapter 15 or so and hesitantly decided to stop reading on that basis. (Technically a premature decision but there's plenty of things to read that *don't* have a 50% chance of frustrating me later.) I'm glad to see my decision vindicated.

    Yeah, he's pretty pointlessly self-sabotaging and blind at times now that I think about it.

      He has some really,**really** heavy PTSD.

      He acts like a child soldier in *real life* would act. When he explains his childhood to the rest of the group, that's exactly what it sounds like. Due to his history in Remnant, that's what the him who grew up there effectively is - he  had to try to protect his family from age 12 onwards, and was considering it from even earlier.

      The rampant paranoia, and effective espionage skills seem to sensibly lead to the actions he takes. The fact that he's clearly unable to see the social consequences to his actions also makes sense - I'm on chapter 19, and he mellows out a lot after he reveals all of his secrets and realizes what an ass he's being.

      The thing is, he's *not wrong.* He actions **do work**. They've kept his team on top of the rankings, earned them notoriety and preferential treatment, and from a rational long-term perspective, his team *is* short sighted and overly idealistic while living in what is basically a **death world**. They haven't internalized that, not really. Blake is the closest because of her history, but even then she still has that hint of idealism and she's only fought human(oid) opponents.

      Remember the history of Remnant - the reason the kingdoms are the only important places is because *intelligent omnicidal megafauna* kill every living thing that isn't protected by magical warriors with gunswords.

      I mean, if this was Naruto, nobody would even be batting an eye. 

      The SI is orders of magnitude less brutal than most Naruto SIs, and the world of Remnant is only slightly less of a death world than Naruto, and that's mainly because the power levels haven't ramped that high yet. If a team in naruto could choose their own missions by being top of the rankings - judging by the difference and danger between the main teams missions in that universe - you'd have to be insane not to see the need to do whatever it took to get that ability because of how much it could increase your survival chances.

        Say that again once you're read up to chapter 28. Then I think you'll agree with me more.

        As an aside, they got to the top of the ranking before he started with the sabotage, and the sabotage only kept JNPR down. It didn't really seem necessary given that Jaune was still essentially mediocre with his blade and unlikely to change that at any great speed. The downsides of his strategy are... considerable.

        Note, I don't think that proactive steps taken in a death world are a bad idea, and I do agree that his team's viewpoint is pretty naieve. I also, however, think that the particular steps that he took were sub-optimal. Knocking down the competition for example. Yes it gives resources, but it also reduces the quality of your sparring partners and thus weakens you. It also destroys team cohesion and trust, which are vital. Aside from that, it destroyed what could have been a powerful alliance with JNPR, which might have allowed them to learn from the best of the best.
        ```

        - u/JackStargazer:
          ```
          Having read the rest of it - I can say that alienating Pyrrha was a *bad move* for sure, and what he did to Jaunne was not effective for the reasons you mention, but his general distrust and paranoia seems effective as a general survival strategy when nobody else on his team seems to get it.

          That whole hierachy thing is starting to strain my SoD though. Homicidal racism to the point of attempted kidnapping, a physical attack (taunt provoked perhaps, but that doesn't let you get away with assault in the real world either) leading to the elder team effectively *evicting* them? 

          From a place they are technically paying for and which that team doesn't even really own? 

          And the only response of the administration is to put them back in what are supposed to be temporary accommodations?

          I can't really blame Enten for acting like mid-late Worm Skitter. Ozpin definitely has an agenda, things are rapidly escalating out of control, and he's similarly willing to do anything to protect his friends. 

          He's also pretty bad at analyzing and judging the benefits of social relationships that aren't in physical or direct benefits. Like he seems to understand friendship on a basic level, but doesn't get the benefits that can come from unquestioning loyalty to friends or networking. 

          His overall proactive strategy is sound but his actions to JNPR were just short-sighted and dumb. He starts to realize this in the recent chapters too.

        Yes, but he isn't a child soldier. He's a fully grown adult surrounded by teenagers inserted into another body. It's not that I'm opposed to a character who will do anything to survive. I actually like that trope. It's that what he's doing is not in the slightest bit effective, and the SI should be able to realize that. He has plenty of strengths he should be playing to and focusing on instead. 


        I'm pretty sure this is intentional, other characters all react to the SI appropriately, and the author is doing it as a way of creating drama and showing the SI's flaws. I just don't like reading about a character that acts in a way that is actively detrimental to their stated goals. It's not engaging for me, just frustrating. 

        >The thing is, he's not wrong. He actions do work. They've kept his team on top of the rankings, earned them notoriety and preferential treatment, and from a rational long-term perspective, his team is short sighted and overly idealistic while living in what is basically a death world. They haven't internalized that, not really. Blake is the closest because of her history, but even then she still has that hint of idealism and she's only fought human(oid) opponents.

        Outside of the unrelated programming stuff, none of the scheming has been remotely effective. In fact they've done the opposite of helping. His team is at the top of the rankings because they have a strong tactical leader (Ruby), an extra member, and much greater teamwork than any of the other groups. Alienating them actively works against those strengths. The only thing the Enten has done that has actually helped has been defeating Pyrhha, which also was not the result of any schemes - instead they almost resulted in his death. 

        Enten even states very early on that he learns the best when he has good competition; this is why he spars with Yang. He's doing his best to ensure that this sort of competition will never exist for his team. Furthermore, these aren't "potential enemies" that he's turning against him. They're fellow hunters who could save his life some time in the future.

         He doesn't even have a *goal* with his backstabbing. What resources is he trying to get that Weiss doesn't already have available to her because of her family? What political allies has he made that he couldn't have had by just being a reasonable person? Cardin? 


        RWBY is a death world, but it's a different kind of death world from something like Naruto; and even then the SI is acting like Sasuke, who isn't exactly popular in the fanbase.
        ```

          It's probably intentional, what annoyed me is that he keeps doing it. If it had happened once and the SI realized just how much of a moron he was being I would have kept on reading.

          And his friends don't even really acknowledge that his tactics don't work. It's what they should be criticizing. Not "hey, your methods are insane even if they do benefit us", more like "hey, your methods are insane, and you kind of suck at being an anti-hero so you might want to stick to developing software and fighting monsters which is kind of our job".

  Only on Chapter 6 right now but I would've really preferred it had the team name been REWBY and not RWEBY. I can't read the latter without seeing it as "ruh-webby".
  ```

- u/glowingfibre:
  ```
  It's good! Do I need to read the source material? (Rwby?) Seems to be going well without it so far...
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    The first season is only about half an hour long if you want background on the setting.
    ```

  Enjoyable to read, good prose, and hardly any munchkinry like most SIs have, so that's always a plus. I will say that if I wasn't already a fan of RWBY (and the Games We Play) I probably wouldn't be giving it this much of a chance.

  About a third of the way through- I'm not going to stop reading it but honestly there hasn't been anything too attention-grabbing yet. I think the best part of it so far is the increased attention on older teams, there are intriguing characters at the least. [And Ozpin](#s "is clearly up to something, as usual. Pretty interested in the implications of this tracking program he's having the protagonist code... And also looking forward to seeing the protagonist actually use those skills for something important.")

  This is way too short, and way too generic, for me to form much of an opinion on the story.

  Seriously. Chapter one is supposed to be your *hook*!

  This was more like, Chapter 1, Scene 1 - 3 of 10.

  I may revisit this if I see additional material posted, given that the writing was technically decent (some odd word choices. For example, "Indecently move".), but the story content with just this chapter is blah.

  Edit: I somehow missed chapters 2 through 32. I'm stupid, ignore me.
  ```

  - u/TennisMaster2:
    ```
    I had the the opposite reaction; there are two hundred sixty eight thousand words, written in a short span of time, making me expect much redundancy in language.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      ... Oh, fuck. 

      Hell, that's what I get for reading this in my last ten minutes at work. I totally missed chapters 2 through 32.

      Welp, ignore what I said. I'm stupid.
      ```

      - u/gabbalis:
        ```
        Nope! Correction denied. From now on you're the man that insists upon 893 thousand word chapters. ;p
        ```
