  Why do Harry's grandkids sound like they're not going to see him again when they literally have mass produced necromancy? Sure at the moment he wouldn't be able to change his mind, but eventually they'll probably find a way to upload spirits into new bodies. Just give the thaumoengineers a few centuries to work at the problem.
