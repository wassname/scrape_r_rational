    Oh come on, Unsong is antirational.
    ```

    - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
      ```
      Unsong is fantasy, but as far as fantasy goes, it has pretty consistent logic and magic. You could say the same of HPMoR, or even some sci-fi stuff: after all, the only fully consistent scientific and technological system we know is our own. Start introducing new rules, there's bound to be *some* contradiction at some level, unless you worked them all out from a theory of everything. Usually we settle for the rules as stated to be more or less consistent, we don't go much into meta-rules, meta-meta-rules, etc.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        I'd actually mark Unsong as being on the far "soft" end of soft-hard magic spectrum. A lot of it is glued together from different ideas that the author had and wanted to exist in the same world, rather than natural outgrowths of a rules-based system or much coherent logic.

        Edit: Just to be clear the "every idea the author had" thing was explicitly posted to Scott's tumblr some time ago, when Unsong was running. I can't find it now, partly because tumblr sucks for searching, partly because Scott increased the privacy settings to require login. A link/quote would be appreciated, if someone has more time/dedication/patience to find one.
        ```

        - u/Escapement:
          ```
          It's possible you're thinking of [Three Magic Systems In Search Of A Fantasy Book](https://archive.fo/V2fOR#selection-1913.138-1925.52), from Scott's old livejournal - ideas 2 and 3 clearly made it into Unsong. Or possibly some other post discussing how Unsong incorporated those and other ideas he's had over the years. Searching for prolific writers' specific writings is hell, and tumblr search is *double* hell.
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            No, it was specifically an acknowledgement that Unsong itself was every story idea he'd ever had (paraphrasing, because obviously I don't have the source). It would have been posted to tumblr after Unsong started, but before it completed.

            If you gathered up all of the component parts of Unsong that had appeared in previous blog posts (either LJ, tumblr, or his blog), I think you'd have something like half the book, maybe more, if you're just counting kernels. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3u39yg/a_collection_of_scott_alexanders_literary_works/).

            Not that I think there's anything *wrong* with putting a whole bunch of previous ideas together, but in the case of *Unsong*, I felt like the whole was less than the sum of its parts (for a variety of reasons).
            ```

          - u/tjhance:
            ```
            unsong also uses ideas from a few of his other stories:

            “Answer to Job”

            “The Study of Anglophysics”

            “Universal Love, said the Cactus Person” (the relation here is somewhat superficial though)

            and possibly more, I haven't read everything he's written.
            ```

        - u/Evan_Th:
          ```
          Considering how many ideas showed up separately on his blog and Tumblr over the years (the idea of magic being copyrighted, the Answer to Job, the Drug Lord, et cetera), this makes total sense even though I don't remember specifically seeing that.
          ```

      - u/tjhance:
        ```
        I like unsong, and I think there's something appealing-to-rational-fic-fans about the way it pokes fun at stuff and about the way some of its characters think. But it really isn't very consistent or predictable at all.

        Whenever a character is doing advanced kabbalah magic (stuff sohu or uriel can do), you just have to roll with whatever they say is possible.

        All the kabbalistic reasoning is really there to make the meta-textual point that you can connect the dots for just about anything when the space of connections you're searching through gets big enough. You can't use it to *actually* make predictions about what will happen in the story.

        Placebomancy is based off of narrative logic, but that really just means the author can do whatever they want and then say "hey, this was a narrative, so it worked".
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          I agree it's not predictable and doesn't fit the "the reader could guess what will happen next" mold. However it does have a lot of philosophy and tinkering with concepts from maths and programming in it. I'm still pretty awed by its answer to theodicy, for example. Let's put it this way, it may be an edge case at best, and not purely 'rational', but calling it 'anti-rational' seems really like a stretch to me. It makes it sound like it's actively going out of its way to be *the opposite* of rational, which I really don't think it does.
          ```

      - u/ArgentStonecutter:
        ```
        There are lots of fantasy novels that have consistent logic and magic, and stick to them. Unsong starts off that way but quickly breaks down into effectively random events that are not even in principle predictable.

        If you want actual rational and consistent magic, I'd start with the Lord Darcy stories which include actual legitimate by-the-rules mysteries.

        >after all, the only fully consistent scientific and technological system we know is our own

        And mind you, the jury is still out on that one.
        ```

        - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
          ```
          I mean... okay, but I'd be surprised if it turned out that GR and QM 'just work' and don't actually agree with each other or an underlying theory at any scale :D. I'm not even sure how that could possibly *work*. What would happen if I try make an experiment at the Planck scale? The Universe crashes to a BSOD due to overflow?
          ```

        - u/GeneralExtension:
          ```
          I don't know what you mean by this statement. Are you saying "we don't know the rules can't be broken just because we haven't found a way to break them yet?" Or do you mean something else?
          ```

          - u/Mr-Mister:
            ```
            I just mean we haven't figured it out/made sense of it completely yet, no further message intended.
            ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Strong agree.  It's non-rational fic that specifically appeals to rational fic readers, like the way that even pure-parkour forums often have that one freerunning video that gets upvoted over and over again.

        It's very good, but it's a world where logic simply does not work because the world has broken.
        ```

        - u/GeeJo:
          ```
          It's broken in consistent ways, though. It might not work like our physics, but you can still predict outcomes based on inputs if you're genre savvy enough. It's not like Uriel could throw out "Correct Horse Battery Staple" in the Kabbalic rap-battles and still claim victory.

            You can't actually know that. Scott could craft a scenario where that seems plausible, and there's nothing in the backstory that would rule it out. Everything in Unsong is narrative-driven.

  Who voted for king killer chronicles to be so high up? Those books are utter trash. Probably the most infuriatingly bad, childish storylines I've read in a fantasy novel.

  Good-at-everything prodigal child attends magic school. All the women want him, all the men want to be him. Constantly pining for and worshipping the manic pixie girl. Only temporarily fails at anything in order to set up how brilliant he is at coming back from any setback. 

  It's like someone wrote a bad wish fulfillment fanfiction of an already bad fanfiction of an amateur story comprised entirely of every tired, overused, terrible fantasy trope. And then combined that with /r/iamverysmart and /r/niceguys. 

  What a pile of dog crap aspiring to be a dumpster fire.
  ```

  - u/Draddock:
    ```
    Patrick Rothfuss has an incredible writing style where the words just flow so smoothly. Whilst I agree on the wish-fulfillment, it also has great world-building and the magical system of sympathy is very rational. 

    The fact that the writing style got the books so freaking popular whilst having all easily identified glaring problems just shows that Rothfuss could write a book about paint drying and have it be wonderful.
    ```

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      I've heard the wish-fulfillment criticism before but it never seemed right to me, and I've just figured out why. Kvothe isn't an everyman protagonist whose shoes you're meant to step into. He's a hero, an archetype, a force of nature. When Kvothe has mind-blowing awesome sex with Felurian, that's not because Kvothe is the vehicle for the reader's wish-fulfillment, it's because he's the foil for the reader's own capabilities. We're not meant to empathize with him. We're meant to be slapped in the face by his alien nature. It's not titillating except in the sense that watching a tornado is titillating. It's mostly just fucking cool.

      Can you give me one example of his supposed good world building or writing style? I can give dozens of examples of his story and world building and style of writing being utter trash. 

      Sympathy is juvenile and simple to the point of being insulting to the reader. I've never read a system of magic as boring and childish. 

      The worst part of it is the multiple pages of dialogue in the music bar between kvothe's group and the manic pixie girl where they explain in excruciating detail to pixie girl (actually to the reader, which is the insulting part) how sympathy works. A classic shitty style of writing where the author forgot the "show, don't tell" rule and just explains his  whole magic system in a long diatribe. Just awful. The insulting part is that he thinks the reader is too stupid to understand it without this long dialogue. The entire sympathy magic is summed up in two sentences:

      Use willpower to cause an effect on something which causes the same effect on a similar item. The higher the similarity between your piece and the target piece, and the closer together they are, the easier it is to cause the effect to the target piece. 

      That's it. It's the sort of magic system a middle schooler comes up with and thinks is really innovative. It's boring, simple, and juvenile. 

      The only magic in the book that seems complex and neat is alchemy. And Rothfuss just uses it as a one time Deux ex Machina for Kvothe to solve some temporary setback,  and then Rothfuss literally, LITERALLY, has one of his secondary characters make Kvothe say, out loud, the exact sentence "I know nothing about alchemy" in order to cop out of having to explain anything about alchemy in his story. Then Rothfuss has Kvothe relay that exact sentence to the Chronicler in order to get it into the book that the reader is holding, as insurance against the reader calling out Rothfuss  about anything to do with alchemy in the story. 

      Rothfuss is directly telling the reader that he's using alchemy to solve a plot point and is never going to explain anything about it. 

      But spends loads of screen time explaining his basic bitch magic directly to the reader instead of just showing how it works. Because obviously the reader is too stupid to get it without the dialogue crammed in there. 

      And it's so ham-fisted. Rothfuss could have had Kvothe explain to the Chronicler directly how sympathy works, cutting out the thin, insulting veil, but instead has Kvothe relay a long, irrelevant section of dialogue to the Chronicler. It has absolutely no bearing on the rest of the story he's telling. It's not like he doesn't skip over massive relevant details in other parts of his story. So why include such an idiotic dialogue about his basic bitch magic?
      ```

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        Not to make excuses as I mostly agree with your, but it is made clear several times that the story we're reading and the story that chronicler is hearing is not the same. Also it wouldn't make sense to explain it directly to chronicler, who is an actual graduate of the University. 

        And I like the magic system. Of all the faults the books have, sympathy is not one of them, imo.
        ```

        - u/Rorschach_And_Prozac:
          ```
          It's actually completely the opposite. When Kvothe first agrees to tell the story, it's on the condition that the Chronicler record exactly what Kvothe says word for word and nothing more or less. Otherwise he won't tell his story. Rothfuss spends a fair bit of dialogue to establish that EVERYTHING you are reading is coming straight from Kvothe's mouth. Including the fucking cliffhangers at the ends of each chapter. Which is ok writing, but makes no fucking sense considering it's not just what Rothfuss is writing, but what kvothe is literally telling the Chronicler.

        I think you read this series much more recently than me, but what I liked what the 3rd layer deep stories.  

        The 1st layer is old Kvothe, 2nd is old Kvothe telling his story about young Kvothe, 3rd layer is young Kvothe hearing/telling a story about something else. When Kvothe hears the story in the bar, from Skarpi (?), about the war (about the Chandrian) that happened eons ago it feels like something incredibly important. To all other characters in the story, it's just a fun story, but to Kvothe and the reader it reveals a fundamental truth about what their world is really like. Even when Kvothe tells silly short stories to his friends, you feel like you get a feel for his own morality and some understanding about his view of the world.

    I think [this review](http://ferretbrain.com/articles/article-751) of Rothfuss' work is pretty good at taking apart his writing from a similar point of view to yours, but with extensive textual support and more examples, to really hammer home the ways Rothfuss becomes unappealing. I mostly agree with the author of that review - the first book showed promise, and the second was so bad that it demonstrated that all of the promise of the first was actually never going to go anywhere good and therefore actively removed enjoyment retroactively.

    I quite disagree with your criticisms for several reasons.  First and foremost, you're looking at it through the wrong lens; you're looking at it as a Harry Potter hero triumphs over adversity kind of story when really it's a tragedy and will end tragically.  You have a hero that's really good at most things obviously and repeatedly fuck himself over through arrogance, anger, and recklessness.  The triumphs *are setting him up for a fall*.  

    &#x200B;

    As for sympathy; you lump three criticisms together: simple, boring, and childish.  Simple it is, but that's not a bad thing, especially not for rationalists.  Complexity frequently brings contradiction, railroading, and plot holes.  Neither are intrinsically indicative of good or bad writing; you're merely stating a preference for complexity.  Boring and Childish are subjective, although I would say that the primary attribute of childish world-building is that they tend not to think about consequences of their world-building decisions and that has not happened here.

    &#x200B;

    As for the scene where one character gets three others drunk and rambling about magic, you were paying attention to the wrong hand in the shell game.  Yes it serves as another explanation for the reader, but the thing that makes the scene interesting is not the young blowhards rambling, it's the questions the young lady is asking.  She's looking for something, and doesn't really get it from asking them.

    &#x200B;

    As for alchemy, it's heavily foreshadowed that it will be used again, multiple times.  It's also the skill that Kvothe is teaching Bast.

    &#x200B;

    As for examples of writing skill, Rothfuss is excellent at foreshadowing, including a major plot point in slant rhyme in a joking poem or in the dismissive comment of a professor.  He uses of metanarrative to create both characterization and make you question the reliability of the narrator.  He repeatedly uses names to make jokes about the characters.  He uses multiple foils of the main character, as tragedies do, to show different potential paths.  He uses constructed etymology to reveal world-building choices.  As jokes or characterization, sometimes characters will break into different rhythms or speak in one case speak entirely in iambic pentameter.

      Thank you, this is much more similar to my own view of the series, the most important part of the story, that everyone seems to forget, is that we already know the ending, Kote is a innkeeper in a tiny inn in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere, if everything that happens in the books is true, and Kvothe is reliably narrating, then how does he get here, with everyone having assumed his death and him just standing around waiting for them to be right? The tragedy is coming, but what is it? How will Kvothe fail? I want to know!

      Listen, some of the criticism is valid, the book is not perfect, and the some way people talk about it makes you think it would be.

      But there is a reason why thousands of people have bothered the author about the upcoming third book, Doors of Stone. There is a reason why people are willing to spend the time trashing the book.

      The sign of a bad book is that nobody reads it, and you can't say that about the Kingkiller chronicles.

      If you come into the series with no expectations, I guarantee you will enjoy the first book. The second is deeply flawed but the first book is very fun, very creative, and with a truly unique writing style.
      ```

    - u/Riyonak:
      ```
      Everyone loves to be contrarian and there are valid complaints about the books. However, they are very widely loved and one of the most popularly recommended series over at /r/Fantasy. People pine for the third book in the series and, as you can probably tell from the discussion that the criticism generated, it isn't the popular opinion on the book. The books are very well written in that they are engaging and the characters are addicting to read. But many characters, especially the main character and his love interest, are deeply flawed people, which is why some people like to shit on it as bad characters.

I'm still unsure if its playing any deeper than 1.5 levels, but it does keep you guessing.
