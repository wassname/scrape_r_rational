  One of the oldest novels I know of that explicitly deals with AI value-alignment.

  I was reminded of this when I was watching [yahtzee's dev diary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mcXPUDfB-4&list=PLAbMhAYRuCUibhDtVUn3WJnHojS2uSNPD&index=25) and shamus young called the safe zone an "exclusion zone", which struck me as an odd turn of phrase and reminded me of this community.
