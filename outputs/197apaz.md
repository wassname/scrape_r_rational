## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Humble Bundle is doing a deal where you can get almost every Discworld ebook for $18. Buy them and read them and spend the rest of your life trying to chase the high they give you, but know it is futile.

    Note that this is DRM'd to a particular obnoxious and uncommon reading app. Like Kindle but more specific and you almost certainly don't have it (unless you got a previous Humble Bundle of Kodo books).

    Still probably worth it but not obviously.

    EDIT: The web client for Kodo sucks, it is managing to lag Firefox singlehandedly.

    SECOND EDIT: They can be extracted as Adobe Digital Editions. Which supposedly are fairly easy to jailbreak as these things go, but I don't know how.

      They work with any ereader that supports Adobe Digital Editions which is pretty much all of them except kindle.

      You can use the obok plugin in calibre to remove the drm.

      Discworld could be "anti rational" in the sense that everybody knows its better to run alongside the fantasy tropes, rather than trying to make it all logical


      1 in a million shoots always work, so they grab an archer and add handicaps until his hit probability falls to 1/1,000,000


      The big bad has spies everywhere, so they check the nearby large containers, and surely, there was a spy


      The assassins guild only kills people in their homes, so they are not confused with random murderers


      The rightful king has returned, but the city runs fine, so nobody mentions it


      The igors are a hunchback clan that employs themselves as henchmen for badass big bads


      There is a replacement god, who covers whenever a god wants a vacation

      The characters mostly qualify as level 2 intelligent and almost all (except ones where 'kind of an idiot' is a known trait, and sometimes even then) as level 1 intelligent.

      The later books get preachier in various ways but remain very well-written even so.

    The three missing books are The Last Hero, Raising Steam, and The Shepherd's Crown.

    Shepherd's Crown will particularly be missed as the final Tiffany Aching book (the children's subseries but also a consistent standout particularly by /r/rational standards). Raising Steam somewhat less. The Last Hero is no big loss.

    EDIT: CORRECTION, Shepherd's Crown *is* included, despite not being in the list. There are 39 books, not 38.

  I enjoy stories where the antagonists is partially the setting itself and having to survive in a difficult environment.  I can recommend [the mine lord](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/76164/the-mine-lord-a-dwarven-survival-base-builder) which is about a team of dwarven prospectors establishing a claim in difficult mountain terrain far from any support. (Ongoing story) I also really liked [to the far shore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50836/to-the-far-shore) where a radiation wizard and a team of caravan travel across a dangerous and largely unsettled continent to reach new lands. Similar to the oregano trail. (Complete) Are there any similar fictions you can recommend where just surviving in an environment is a major conflict?

    [Hatchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatchet_%28novel%29) is a great book in this vein, a classic. Plot is that a young man survives a plane crash in the wilderness with only a hatchet.

    I loved Naomi Novik's [*Scholomance* trilogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scholomance_Trilogy). Almost everyone in those books is basically good; to the extent that they do bad things sometimes, it's because they're in a desperate struggle to keep themselves and their families from being devoured by magical monsters, which doesn't always leave them the luxury of being as moral as their consciences would prefer.

    And they're just really entertaining to read. I was drawn in right from the first chapter.

    *The Left Hand of Darkness* by Ursula K. Le Guin is a novella in which the main character has to struggle through an arctic terrain for much of the story. 

    *The Forgotten Enemy* by Arthur C Clarke is about a man in London trying to survive a sudden ice age. 

    You've probably already heard of it, but a recent book *The Martian* by Andy Weir is about a stranded astronaut on Mars.

    The basic premise of mine lord is that ~6 adult dwarf prospectors, age 40-80 I think, are so... addicted to mining? so socially incompetent? that they'd rather starve/forget to forage enough calories for winter.

        Well, since we're talking about Dwarf Fortress now, I guess I'll give a rec for the work of [Kruggsmash](https://www.youtube.com/@kruggsmash), who makes illustrated videos of various Dwarf Fortress runs, following different Dwarven civilizations. He's fantastic at crafting a narrative for his Dwarf Fortress playthroughs, and you really end up attached to the various dwarves he focuses on.

        Here, for example, is the first episode of the series following Scortchfountain, a fortress built in a volcano and led by a necromancer.

          Seconding this.

          I’ve been working through his Short Forts playlist, and just watched [this]() gem: a dwarven hill fort with no chopping of trees. It was intended to make its money taming and selling animals to the elves of an isolated island civilization. Kruggsmash hoped to get enough in-game skill with taming an animal type that it could be taken on future embarks. Art highlights include a cage with 50 adders, badger-themed decor, and of course the bone tree. Because they weren’t chopping trees, sheep and other critters would occasionally get stuck in the branches of a particular tree. As more of them starved to death, the tree ended up festooned with sheep skeletons. How dwarven.

      I'd say that the dwarves are psychologically different from humans, far more controlled by greed among other differences. I've been reading them as inhuman characters and enjoying it.

      ```

      - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
        ```
        Being far more stubborn than humans, often to their own detrement, is also a common dwarf trait. Warhammer dwarfs are infamous for it.

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        Dwarfs have steam engines and steam engine level precision manufacturing,  which I would expect to have an impact on, well, anything. 

        The Ürsil goblin enemies are tool using primitives, have only screech-language,  they are agressive, they also have black warty skin and stink to the heavens. The charitable explanation of this is bad writing,  the uncharitable one is standard racism tropes against black people leaking trough. The main enemy in this series is not dangerous because they are quite intelligent/making good plans etc, no, they are simply breeding fast. 

        Dwarven sex distribution is skewed 3-4M:1F. One can be forgiven for knowing that genetics make this not happen. However it results in all sorts of shennanigans that mostly look like very outdated human gender roles. Eg. arranged marriages, wearing veils, a dwarf woman can either decide to learn a craft and marry that craft, living without child or partner. Or she can marry a male dwarf, and never learn a craft, becoming housewives. Male dwarfs don't engage in childrearing. Oh, and male dwarfs lie to the women, with huge glaring stuff you could sue for, without that resulting in revenge from other male dwarfs. 

         Dwarfs live to 200-250, even with the longer childhood there'd be enough time to have family and craft. Oh, and despite all that women can marry very rich among their suitors dwarven society is very deeply patriarchal.  


        Now we start to get into stuff from the books, which I have read in one of my reading fugues, and regret doing so:  

        Dwarfs are very honor-bound, breaking ones oath is about the worst thing one can do, but when a dwarven authority figure does so its not held against them in any relevant way. This oath-abiding also doesn't translate to law-abinding; there is very little rule of law, and instead rule of might holds, your clans/father/brother/uncle threating action. 

        Magic is a thing in the world! Its never mentioned AT ALL until book III, when suddenly theres lord of the ring sized magical happenings, randomly thrown in to provide a plot, as far as I can tell. 

        Theres more, stuff that seems to be mostly about bad writing: 

        Dwarfs don't read or write. In 4 books the only time when stuff is written down is i in stonework inscriptions, zero(!) books anywhere. Dwarfs don't play music, dance, or have other standard trappings of cultural works; I believe once or twice they sing. 

         Dwarfs are gruff and don't talk a lot, again, this seems to be mostly so that the author doesn't have to write dialogue. 

        Male dwarfs seem to be basically asexual, zero masturbation/homosexuality, (they live in very close quarters) until- until they see the face of a female dwarf they find pretty, then they become stuttering idiots.

        Dwarven society is extremely strongly gerontocratic, being the eldest means you are right, you can decide etc.
        ```

        - u/Dragongeek:
          ```
          Nitpick on the point about the goblins:

          At least from what I've read so far (only Mine Lord), I interpreted the negative traits of the goblins as unreliable narration. It's well established that the dwarves are quite stupid when it comes to real-world, above-ground survival tasks. They don't even have names for animals like "deer", and all they know about the goblin threat is basically hearsay--they are hilariously underprepared in the knowledge department. 

          In fact, I'd say a reoccurring theme in the story (so far) is the dwarves underestimating the threat, and they are nearly constantly surprised at their "cleverness" and in a reactive stance towards them. 

          The details you mention, like their smell, lack of language, or other traits are also from the perspective of the dwarves. It's not an uncommon in real history that "civilized" folk see indigenous populations as savages--the dwarves are expecting monstrous foes, so all they hear is screeches when it might actually be a structured language. 

          Similarly, the point about smell could also just be a trait of dwarves: It's highlighted that the dwarves have extremely sensitive noses (they can use smell to identify minerals), and there could've been evolutionary pressures that drove dwarves to instinctively notice and recoil at the scent as a matter of self-preservation: similar to how humans are evolutionary predisposed to visually identifying snakes. 

          All that said, the concept of "goblins" is generally fraught with antisemetic or racist themes, so who knows.

          ```
          It's not obvious that steam automatically leads to industrial revolution sans specific material and cultural preconditions, if that's what you're implying. There was a long stretch historically where steam was in use in only marginal ways (pumping mines), and a much longer period of time where its principles were known but there were no practical applications. We also only have n=1 on steam presaging an industrial revolution, so I think it's reasonable to interpret alternative paths or slowdowns. I think in this series it's mainly just used as an alternative fuel source for smelting, but might be misremembering.

          You summarize a bunch of other things it sounds like you don't like. I'm guessing you don't read much written before 1970 or so? I'll agree that it's a fair summary of the material and social conditions in the story.
          ```

    - u/hwc:
      ```
      The incompetent dwarves come from a society where there is always food available, and they have worked as professional miners.  They haven't adjusted to the reality that they may need to put more than half of their energy towards just staying alive.  Yes, the protagonist is the only one not holding the idiot ball during the first few chapters; that's why he becomes the leader!  Also, these are not humans!  The failure modes for dwarfish thinking are different from ours.

    I'll re-recommand [The Rise and Fall of the Dark Lord Sassaflash](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/93572/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-dark-lord-sassaflash), a My Little Pony fanfic that's a glorious homage to the cosmic horror works of H.P. Lovecraft. The environment they have to survive to achieve their goal is etched into my memory, and I occasionally randomly think of that cursed place and shiver.

    [My earlier recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4s1p4g/the_rise_and_fall_of_the_dark_lord_sassaflash/) has a thread with lots of spoilers. I'll just quote from there: "[The Terry Pratchett tone] lasts until the trip to Hollow Shades. From there to the tomb, it's Lovecraft, and from the tomb to the end, it's Yudkowsky."
    ```

    - u/GrecklePrime:
      ```
      Tried it out, not a big MLP fan but damn. That was a good damn story. And surprisingly relevant as someone who has been numb to the emotional content of old memories and recently was forced into finally processing them. It was kinda eerie seeing that written out. Made me a lot more sympathetic to Sassaflash than I think I would have been otherwise.

  Is there a dungeon core story where someone goes like" I've reincarnated as a dungeon core. I gain power whenever humans die within my dungeon. therefore instead of the monsters and traps business I'm going to start an old folks home."
  ```

  - u/DomesticatedDungeon:
    ```
    There was one where that's literally what happened. He basically built a town inside himself and kept growing it. All the people eventually dying inside were fuel for his growth. Unfortunately, I think I've encountered it at least 2–5 years old by now, so I don't remember which one it was.

    A somewhat similar thing also happens in *[Tree of Aeons](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20568/tree-of-aeons-an-isekai-story/)*. His citizens whom he protects and who live near his tree network "donate" certain parts of their souls to him (a psychopomp), which he then uses in various ways in power multiplication projects for himself and his civ.

    IIRC, there should also be a relevant short story mentioned somewhere around here that was about Koschei (I think?) helping a town proliferate, because >!he gained power from deaths he caused, and each birth he caused would eventually result in a caused death as well!<.
    ```

- u/AviusAedifex:
  ```
  I wanna recommend the manga Sensou Kyoushitsu, or The Bugle Call. Its setting is medieval dark fantasy, but it has the usage of powers that would fit this sub really well. Like an example from the current arc if you want some spoilers, >!has a user that can use mirrors as portals.!< >!And instead of catapults, they push rocks into one mirror, which is then dropped into another, and another. Like in Valve's Portal, although, I don't remember if you actually keep increasing in velocity in Portal if you keep falling, but either way, the rocks do here. Then once they reach a high enough velocity they're shot out.!<

  The story and the world are also pretty interesting, as are the characters. There's 14 chapters out now, but it's a monthly manga, so they have 60 pages each, so it's about 60 chapters in comparison to weekly ones. There is a scene in a later chapters that is one of the coolest fights I've ever seen.

  The closest comparison to it would probably be Practical Guide to Evil, although I only read the beginning of it, but it has similar world where the protagonist leads an army.

      ```
      I'll just say these.

      1. The solution is polarizing. You may not be happy with it.
      2. The solution is a commentary on the nature of puzzles. What makes a puzzle hard?
      3. Think about the fourth wall. Or the fifth

      The game is a bit of a brainworm and a troll, so hope you don't hate me too much for sharing it. Thanks for trying it out.

      Update: it took me a long time to solve it. There's a review on IFDB that says that some may never solve it, some might solve it much faster, and I'd echo those sentiments with regard to how long it took me to solve it.

[Chili and the Chocolate Factory](https://recordcrash.com/shill/22/Chili+and+the+Chocolate+Factory) has an entire subplot about an IRC channel going crazy, but it's only part of it.

  Can anyone recommend some truly excellent Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder fiction? I just finished [Project Lawful](https://www.projectlawful.com/posts/4582), and it was brilliant. I shouldn't have doubted Eliezer. I had to make a truly superhuman effort to get through the first few pages because Keltham's dath ilani way of thinking/speaking was absolutely unbearable, but he does eventually get *Share Language* cast on him and it magically (heh) became enjoyable. Still had to skip maybe 15% of it (some of the lectures, some of the Carissa-focused bits, and all of the sex), but even so I can safely say that if you like D&D/PF, or rational fics in general, you owe it to yourself to ignore whatever it is you may dislike about glowfics or dath ilan or whatever, and read Project Lawful. I promise it's worth it.

  Other amazing D&D fics I can think of are [Doors to the Unknown](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doors-to-the-unknown-worm-d-d-fusion-crossover.1001110/), a D&D/Worm crossover that's been recommended here before, and [Tales of Wyre](https://leagueofimaginaryheroes.wordpress.com/2009/03/22/sepulchraves-tales-of-wyre/), an extremely high level campaign turned into glorious fiction.

    You might find great enjoyment in *Harry Potter and the Natural 20*. It's fantastic.

    I simply can't get over the glowfic format. I've tried a few times, and I just can't get into it.

      I get it, I do! My first three tries at reading Project Lawful the glowfic format stopped me. Then the fourth try it was Keltham (the MC)'s personality and way of speaking. It's only on my fifth try, months later, that I managed to persevere long enough to get hooked.

      For me it kind of clicked once I started thinking of it more as a visual-novel format rather than a typical novel format, in which case it solved my problem with visual-novels where they're somewhat annoying to pause and read back in.

    There's a _ton_ of [glowfic set in Golarion](https://glowfic.com/posts/search?board_id=&character_id=&setting_id=1124&subject=&commit=Search) aside from planecrash., and you can filter to [threads by lintamande](https://glowfic.com/posts/search?author_id%5B%5D=34&board_id=&character_id=&commit=Search&page=2&setting_id=1124&subject=) for most shared context/characters with planecrash. I'd recommend [only that which they defend](https://glowfic.com/boards/176#section-553) as particularly excellent.

  I noticed the lack of mention of many good rational fanfiction in the My Little Pony universe, so I decided to drop the short story collections here.

  [https://www.fimfiction.net/group/212948/folder/60720/all?order=rating](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/212948/folder/60720/all?order=rating)[https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/folder/16682/approved?order=rating](https://www.fimfiction.net/group/1418/folder/16682/approved?order=rating)  


  I don't like some of them or they don't seem rational for me, but most of them are really high-quality.

    I wasn't going to call the completed [Background Pony ](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/19198/background-pony) rational, but it features an intelligent protagonist in a pretty fucked up situation that gathers information and solves the "puzzle" on how she's in the situation she's in and how to solve it. 
    There's even a solution to the problem that can be solved by the readers, given the pieces that the author shows us!

    If I'm not trying to sell it to rational readers, I'd say it's a very sad and emotional story about bonds and the relationship between people. Very good, very intense. If art is defined by its ability to make us feel emotions, this is definitely art.

    Warning, not recommended to those with depression or whose mood can be too easily affected by fiction. Or those that have to study for exams. I'm not a cop, do what you want.

    For a somewhat less "emotional" story, [Esquestria: The House of The Sun](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/esquestria-the-house-of-the-sun-a-pony-cultist-experience.71721/) (still updating) is a crossover quest of My Little Pony with Cultist Simulator. 
    You don't need to know anything about any one particular part of the crossover, though at least a bit of knowledge of MLP is recommended. That's how I read it and I enjoyed it a lot.

    The MC is part of a cult, that plans to do bad things for good reasons. If you liked the moral ambiguity of Worm, but wanted a little more emotional intelligence from Taylor, you may like this. Great use of font color and chapter formatting. Also has very intense chapters, though the beginning can be a little meh.

    Have also a fimfiction link if you hate quests or SV [here](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/548790/1/esquestria-the-house-of-the-sun-a-pony-cultist-experience/background-and-beginnings)

    Also, ConstructionFan4255, any story you do personally recommend? Doesn't have to be rational.

      Seconding *Background Pony*. It's really good from the technical standpoint, and it never made me mad about the decisions any of the characters made—which is a rarity in web fiction. With that said, I found it *very* depressing and couldn't finish because of it a few years ago. It's not the saddest story ever told, of course, but the assessment that it's "very intense" is 100% correct—it never stops being actively depressing, which can make it a hard read for some.
