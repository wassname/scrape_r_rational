  Yes.  I didn't know this consciously until seeing it on Kaj's FB feed, but this is a HUGE part of how I make r!Animorphs tick.

  Okay so this is a good essay and I agree with it but the part where they said "the claws and wings say it might be a griffon" while discussing a book called "the dragon prince" made me laugh.

    Now I want a book with a long, detailed, and completely false/misleading title.

    The dragon-rider knights book one: the sword of truth

    The story turns out to be about a goblin mage who rides a chicken and wields a sapling.

      There are probably manga that satisfy these conditions.

      The Dragonback Series from Timothy Zahn comes to mind. Theyâ€™re dragons in only the loosest sense and no one ever actually rides on their back (if anything, they ride on humans).

      I want a really really good fantasy book, like on the level of lord of the rings. Then before the climatic break, the PCs little brothers wander into the room and we get something like this: I cast magic missile at the darkness!

  This is actually really good advice. You can tell the difference between good and mediocre writing, but it's far harder to concretely describe what makes good writing good.

    Unseen mastery bias. It's hard to understand just how extremely difficult it is to be *good* at certain things, let alone great. It's why the average person thinks that writing is easy, when even mediocre writing can be pretty difficult. Why so many people think that they can--with zero experience--seclude themselves with a typewriter and a box of cigars and "write the next great american romance".

    Something that was pointed out to me is how much amateur fiction uses epithets. It's very common to see someone referred to as 'The brunette said' in one sentence and then 'the blue-eyed girl smiled' the next and on and on. It's especially notable in gay stories where just pronouns don't cut it, so the author shuffles back and forth between epithets for each of the characters in a scene even when they're completely irrelevant to the scene.

    Meanwhile professional writers just use character names.

      I did a study on my own about just this when I was trying to figure out how to write better dialog. The big one-sentence zigger answer is: You want the reader to know who's saying what, without ever noticing *how* they knew. There's a recurring pattern that all the big authors use and it can be boiled down to a priority list like this:

      1. Best case is that you don't need *anything*. If a character is unique from others, just the way they talk or think is enough for the reader to know who's saying what.
      2. Plan B would be action tags. I always thought these were a little nebulous to understand until I realized its dirt simple: Putting **any** sort of sentence that involves a character, followed by the dialog right after, the reader will automatically attribute the speech to that character without being conscious of it. Can work backwards too on some cases. Could be as tiny as a two-word sentence like 'Remona giggled. "That treat was quite excellent."' Or even a sentence that has nothing to do with talking. 'Remona fiddled with the contraption in vain. "Blasted thing isn't working right."'
      3. Plan C is to use Said, Asked, Replied, and other dirt simple words. But the goal of these is to be read like punctuation. You only use as little as possible to jumpstart the dialog and leave the reader alone after. If the reader ever notices one of these, it's failed its duty.

      That's it. That's the bread and butter of dialog from what I found out. If you're using complicated words to replace said, that be a paddlin'

      Only exceptions are words that convey things nothing else could. Like volume level.
      ```

        ```
        Ever wonder why significant characters in light novels seem to often have some sort of verbal tick, and poorly translated LNs occasionally confuse who's saying what? 

        IIUC it's for this reason - light novel authors in the original Japanese tend to skip the "said <so and so>" part of dialogue, and make up for it by having people speak distinctively (which is apparently a lot easier in Japanese). 

        Also happens a lot in manga and comics, so you can tell who's saying what when it's hard to indicate (e.g, Naruto's "dattebayo").
