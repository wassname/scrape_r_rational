  I am officially *back*.

  Clever quote to be posted here soon, in the meantime don't let the unreliable narrators bite - or do if you're into that.

  >Is that why your god hated us back when he existed?


  SOUND THE ALARUM BELLS WARNINGWARNINGDANGERAAAAAAHHHHH

  This is a universe where beings people agree should be called Gods *can cease to exist* and *people react to this as if it is a quaint historical fact.*

    I read that more in the sense of a teasing "Is that why your imaginary friend hated us back when he existed?", Not "Is that why Jahova hated us back when he was a tangible entity?"

    On the other hand, Lyra started as an imaginary friend, and most polytheistic deities are anthropomorphic, I would not be remotely surprised if most known deities were originally succubi, and heroic humans or demigods being their hosts.

    I would absolutely love to see this world's version of Orpheus and Eurydice.

    If you're going to worry about something, worry about what our narratrix's references to her mother might portend. Mother's day is coming up, after all.

    *Ehem* Mother of Learning.

  I don't quite understand. What makes artificial gravity fundamentally impossible? Because I don't see how it can lead to perpetual motion machines aka violate laws of thermodynamics.

    This was something I almost actually took out because I think it's unclear to the reader. The answer, of course, is that he's *wrong*, but that his obsession with this issue tells us something about what's happening to him mentally at this moment and represents something that I've noticed to be a pretty common mental failure mode for people (e.g., myself) who end up in extremely out-of-context circumstances. I'm curious to see if anyone's unpicked what, before I go posting about it.

  Been checking your blog about the story like twice a week, really happy the storry didnt die. Welcome back and stay awesome.

  So, something's up with copper again, how strange. In Mistborn, is can store memories or hide magic from detection, in Kingkiller, copper has no true name. Something about it is unsettling here as well.

  ```
  Now I know I'm Dres rather than Hollow Heart, because I can't imagine leaving the mystery of antigravity *aside* just for a chance at kinky sex with the dream girl.
