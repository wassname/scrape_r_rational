  Honestly, I think the horror aspect in this Author's stories would be more effective if they didn't all have the same ending. There's never any suspense, because the protagonist always loses. 

  As always, there are metaphors to be drawn and ugly things to see, and sometimes there's even an interesting original idea. But there's this undercurrent of industrial sameness to it, where you always lose, even if you happen to win. It's almost as if the collection of stories as a whole is a metaphor for the individuals. 

  In most stories, you see rational behavior bent for sake of plot. In stories by this author, you see it bent for sake of grim metaphor instead; it's certainly different, but I'm not sure it's anymore actual Rat!fic than the former is.

    I am relieved that comes across clearly. What you wrote there is about as concise (yet accurate) a description of what I am "about" as I have ever seen. My core is a featureless concrete cube and the intolerable feeling of grinding, repetitive, frigid banality is indeed what most of my work strives to capture. 

    >There's never any suspense, because the protagonist always loses.

    I can't argue with that, haha. It is horror, after all. But I have some [science fiction](https://www.inkitt.com/stories/scifi/14223) where a clever protagonist uses his brain to come out on top. You might also like my Little People trilogy, as it ends in an ultimately happy albeit somewhat bittersweet way. Likewise with The Black Pool, come to think of it.  

    Maybe it's just a difference in taste but I can't imagine *horror* with a truly happy ending that I'd actually want to read.

    No, it really isn't.

    Pedal power: the most efficient of solutions. 

    Really, there's a lot worse than that going on (it's suspect where energy actually enters this system from at all, or even where all the extra mass to send away comes from.) It was the silliness of the pedaling that really drove it all in though.

    The main character makes what I feel is a rational decision at the end, upon discovering there is nowhere to escape to and nothing to be gained from trying to topple the existing paradigm. 

    This is in contrast to the typical rah rah, overthrow the system plots found in films like Snowpiercer, for example. When the end basically implies that the outcome was to destroy themselves.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The rational action at this point is actually maximum spite. Attempt to destroy as much as possible, kill as many as you can, and ruin whatever you see until you are dead. Anything else encourages the behavior of the universe as it stands.

      You can even argue that it's possible he's being simulated; in this case spite is an even more effective choice because if enough simulated people are spiteful and destroy as much as they can through their hate, the project as a whole might be dismissed as unfeasible.

      Love doesn't beat apathy. Hatred does. If ever you find yourself entirely doomed, if everything you care about is ash, grab onto your inner dark side as tightly as you can and let it rule you and fill you with its fire.

      ```
      I don't know. From a negative utilitarian or deontological or position, the end of Snowpiercer is perfectly rational. I don't think that the story qualifies as "rational" on the basis of the character making a single decision, especially when it appears to be breaking the rules on the sidebar. 

      I mean, for starters, "nothing happens solely because the plot requires it" and "if the characters do (or don't do) something, there must be a plausible reason." As much as I wanted to "buy in" and suspend my disbelief, I just couldn't do it anymore once our protagonist claimed that the escapee had bitten his ear and *nobody* thought that it was a bit weird to encounter this when they had just heard an announcement that the escapee had a tagged ear. 

      To be frank, this feels like a perfect example of what doesn't fit in the genre, and I think that you know this, considering that you've described the story as a "lucid nightmare." If all that's required for a story to be rational is that a character make one reasonable decision then the term is essentially meaningless.

        Hm. I guess so. I will at least come away with a better idea of what this sub is looking for, then.

    - u/narfanator:
      ```
      Actually.... I don't know about that [upon discovering...]. It strikes me as a sort of inverse Pascal's Mugger. There are times when the "rational" action is what is classically "irrational" - and this strikes me as one such situation. If all rational courses of action lead to shitty situations, then isn't the actual rational course of action to look at irrational actions? It's not like they could make the situation *worse*.

  Do the fat people on top get eaten by the all-consuming Flesh Above too?

  Maybe not, but then, the tower feeds the fat people and the Flesh Above. They seem to have the same role of horribleness.

  Is this a parable for multipolar traps?

    To some extent, in that workers on each level whip those below them out of fear of punishment from the levels above. But that's part and parcel of the overall analogy for the structure of society, and my (probably naive) wish that the exploitative brutality of it can't be explained by human greed alone. That there is instead something worse than the rich, literally inhuman, we can't see from the bottom that's making them do these things

      It's incentive structures all the way down.

      I was curious about the metaphor of the inhuman element.  

      as a reader, I fluctuated between two views: that it was to show how awful it was to continue such a system in ABSENCE of an external threat such as this-- that is, that it should require such horror to breed horror, yet we do it willingly. 

      and secondly, that it was somehow a metaphor for the demands of nature, of entropy, the universality of death.

    I tried to read it. It did have potential and I was interested in finding out why they were all there, but I couldn't get past the ridiculous Tumblr strawman character. Over and over--"Hey, let's take a break from the plot for a few paragraphs so the author can ridicule ideas they clearly don't understand, using an unsympathetic caricature as the mouthpiece of their opposition." It's every bit as cringeworthy as if "Melissa" were to write her own story where "Andrew" is like "DURRR, I'M A WHITE PRIVILEGED CISHET DUDE AND I HATE EVERY OTHER KIND OF PERSON AND I WANT TO HAVE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES OVER THEM FOREVER BECAUSE I'M ENTITLED TO THAT," while Melissa effortlessly shoots down his intentionally flimsy talking points. If the author self-identifies as a rationalist, I would expect them to engage with their opponents' best arguments, not with the asinine funhouse mirror version thereof. 

    I mention that one specifically because the point where I stopped was when those two characters were having a ridiculously one-sided argument, in which the concept of privilege was badly misrepresented even by the character who was supposed to be defending that concept--but the "otaku" and "religious nut" characters were also unrelatable caricatures who seemed to exist just to mock groups of people, not as realistic depictions of different kinds of humans whose values can come into conflict.

    Putting aside the strawman thing, it's fine to incorporate one's own sociopolitical opinions into a work of fiction, but if you don't even try to make it subtle, it sticks out like a sore thumb and comes across as soapboxing. I think the author achieved that subtlety with the human farm story, which I enjoyed a lot. The political point was conveyed by the story itself, not by having characters pause in the middle of the story to exposit it. But the one you linked, not so much.
    ```

      I think maybe the intent was to make everyone a strawman? But she received a lot more screentime than the other characters. Or it's just really bad writing with lots of unintentional reliance on stereotypes. Stereotypes are fine if you know what you're doing with them, but I don't really see what they were trying to accomplish.

        Like I said, I thought many of the characters were ridiculous caricatures. I went into more detail about that example because that was the first extensive, fully-realized "DURR, I'M A DUMB WRONG PERSON"/"I'm calmly refuting your points" debate that I got to in my reading.

        Using caricatures is a legitimate technique that can be applied well or poorly. I think it was applied poorly here.

        It's fine for you to be pissed off by my reaction. That's reasonable. I would probably be upset if someone disliked a work of fiction I had recommended, too. However, I stand by what I wrote.

            You're free to make whatever assumptions you want about my motivations. I'm not going to get into a debate about what is or isn't going on inside my  head. I will happily engage with counterarguments against the substance of what I wrote.

            I won't dispute that the survivalist's characterization was worse, since I haven't read the entire story. My argument isn't that the "SJW" character was the most ridiculous caricature, it's that the abundance of ridiculous caricatures made the story feel like the author's soapbox and detracted from its quality.

                Sure, here are some ways I felt it was mishandled:

                1. In my opinion, good satire ridicules ideas by having a character (or the setting) take those ideas to their extreme in a humorous way, and then having their humorous actions stand on their own. If you actually have the "smart" character start debating the satirized concepts with the satirical character, it ruins it. The debate feels hollow and one-sided, since one side is intentionally a strawman, and it's also so on-the-nose that it turns the rapier wit of satire into a sledgehammer. I'm not saying that that approach can never work, but I think it is very difficult to execute well.

                2. The caricatures were unsubtle and mean-spirited. I mentioned before about taking an idea to its extreme. That might sounds like it can't be done subtly, but it can be. It's the difference between a character saying "You're so selfish not to donate to my church! Jesus tells us to give our possessions to the less fortunate; but I'm saved so I can keep all my money, it's okay for me but not you," vs a character saying "You're so selfish not to donate to my church, Jesus tells us to give our possessions to the less fortunate" while sitting on a golden throne and wearing a jeweled crucifix. That second example isn't exactly subtle, but it's subtle *enough.*

                3. There was nothing fresh or original about the caricatures. The "ha ha gross furry otaku" and "blue-haired SJW feminist who eats donuts all day and hates white men" strawmen, for example, have been done to death in online discourse. 

                Sorry for taking so long to respond. Your question was legitimate, so I wanted to put an effort into my reply.

            The survivalist's goal was never to ensure everybody lived, but to meet his own needs. His objection was to being automatically roped into a social contract with people he did not know or like.

            But admittedly, they were over the top for no better reason than I felt it would make for a more entertaining story. A bunch of crazy assholes trapped together is a lot more fun to read about than reasonable people cooperating without friction towards a shared goal.
