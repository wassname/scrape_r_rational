## Looking for Recommendations

### Post:

I'm looking for story with Territory building elements as the main focus. I have tried a couple Chinese translated novels but I just couldn't get into them, I read like 20+ chapters of The World Online before giving up and I don't think I'll find my fix from translated novels. Korean novels might work but I haven't found one yet other than Legendary Moonlight Sculptor where its just a minor element,and Seoul Station's Necromancer which was honestly had a great idea but the territory building aspect was sidelined completely.

I also like pokemon type taming or summoning type novels, so if there is a novel which has these elements as a focus, I'd love to know. Long Live Summons is the only novel that I have read.

I'm asking here because whatever reviews I read are negative so I don't know if a novel will be good

  You might like Jim Butcher's Codex Alera series; the Furies in that series have been explicitly described as being inspired by Pokemon.

    Hmm, I've heard of that series but haven't had the chance to read it yet,

      Its a very fun series but may not actually have the explicit territory-building you are interested it. However, I think it is an absolutely FUN read with great action, magic/powers, politics, and characterbuilding.

  You might try Cast Under an Alien Sun, about an engineer who finds himself on an alien world. Winds up starting an industrial revolution, running a town, getting involved in politics, etc.

  Not quite what you're asking for, but one of the side PoV characters in **The Wandering Inn** has territory elements to his thing. If you're a fan of rational works though you may find TWI annoying to read, as the two main PoV characters are frequently not terribly rational, to put it mildly.
