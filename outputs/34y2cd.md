## [WIP] Magic System Critique: Flaws and Abusive Points

### Post:

I have written a (very long) paper about my magic system. It would be fantastic if anyone would take the time to type below any flaws (contradictions, weirdness, etc.) and anything that can be abused (infinite energy, OP, etc.).

Here are the bullet points that basically describe the system:

-Energy is needed to cause the magic to begin

-You need rare runic stones to allow this energy to be used for work

-Runic stones are volatile by nature; contained by inscriptions that can be broken to release the stone, and so release the energy inside it

-Residue from runic stones attach to 'exit' points on a human, and act as 'turbines' to spin the energy in humans to create a sort of slingshot cycle for more work to be possible (energy creates more ability to do action) and allows energy to leave

-Gel is the natural substance of this energy created through the 'turbines' (you can actually touch the capability to do work!)

-The will and intention of the sorcerer changes the gel's physique

-Outside energy is added to the gel (fire, friction) to create an action. Amount of energy and amount of gel changes the intensity of action according to the will

-Catalysts decrease activation energy for more ambitious gels

-Magic is also used as a way to augment human ability

Here's the link to the full dissertation:

Ignore the racist scholar parts if you want, they are unimportant and were just something added on a whim (wrote this awhile ago).

Thank you for taking the time to read this! Please tell me anything I did wrong - either with this post itself or the writing.

Also, is this the right subreddit for this kind of thing? And is my tag correct? I really don't know how to do things on Reddit.

  > through the countryside of what was known as Mother Huraedon

  of *who* was known as? (reads) No, it looks like the name of a country. That's confusing. I suggest you either say "the country of Mother Huraedon" or rename it something else.

  > temperatures of exactly 1.538 million Celsius

  How many significant figures counts as exact?

  According to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature) this is about 1/10 the temperature of the core of the sun. It is more than enough to melt all rocks and minerals [plotted here](http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/Fundamentals/HardnessMeltingPlot06.pdf) by a few orders of magnitude. Unless the runes are made out of a material with an appallingly high melting temperature or the explosions happen under appallingly high pressure, this will melt the runes in question.

  > runes can only be utilized if refined, and then broken after refinement

  Can a rune be broken more than once? Presumably no.

  > this quick explosion is only logistically possible once a year

  World building inference: only governments can arrange it. This has many implications about availability to civilians and organized crime.

  > nasty sunburns

  Suggests ultraviolet light in the explosion. Explained by black-body radiation of the runes. Later he says that there are no survivors because they are burned to a crisp. Unclear why the mages sent to do it cooperate and why sunburns are an issue to the ashes of a human body.

  > left in the cavern to cool down

  This could be accelerated with water but since the latency is already a year on producing more, a few days are unlikely to make a difference.

  > stones are carved into small pebbles

  Are these held in pockets?

  > any Actions done from a rune is

  is -> are

  If the spell to refine runes is easy to learn and cast, suicidal mages could use it to blow things up. Is this spell something other than a Rune?

  When the rune vaporizes, does it literally turn into gas or does it simply vanish? I wouldn't want to breathe one.

  > all runes with the same inscription are vaporized

  Even ones you don't own?

  > The laser used to write the seal is constructed in such a way that they are tailor made to a magi's voice.

  The seals are tailored to a particular magi's voice or the lasers are tailored to a particular magi's voice?

  > catch an utilize

  an -> and

  Be careful about "utilize". It means "to make useful" and can pretty much always be replaced with "use".

  > rps (rotations per second)

  If you have to say what the acronym stands for, don't bother with the acronym.

  How exactly did they measure the rotation speed of the elemental traces?

  Munchkin: if you chain the syllables, you can make it so that as you are speaking you can decide how many of your runes you want to activate: "AB" activates two, "ABC" activates three, "ABCD" activates four, etc.

  Can you inscribe more than one trigger phrase on the same rune? It might be convenient to have an "all fire spells" command or whatever.

  Must all Actions be immediate?

  > us Magi are able to do

  us -> we

  ---

  Overall it's unclear what can and cannot be done with an Action, which is seemingly the most important part for finding flaws. Can mages spin a turbine, harvesting soul/extrauniversal energy into electricity, or directly create current? Depending on the tech level that could have significant impact.

  How simple must the actions be? Is matter creation possible?

  Must runes be associated with particular spells or are runes just a source of mana?

  If runes can do particular spells then you might do something fancy with making a rune automatically reproduce a recording of your voice giving the command for another rune, and if you can make it do so under useful conditions you've got the beginnings of a computer or a Contingency spell.

  Is remote action impossible? Must the gel directly touch anything it affects and pass through all space in between the mage and the target?

  Can spells be blocked in any way?

  Do detection spells exist? What can they detect?
  ```

- u/Manthyus:
  ```
  Runic stones = unstable. Become inert unstable or explosive unstable? You said store them in vacuum chambers to keep them from touching any matter, I believe. So they're basically antimatter grenades? I see military applications. So would many people in your world, unless the energy released is low. 

  Define "will" and "intention". Specific mental states (i.e. patterns of activation of neurons across specific areas of the brain)? Language based, but telepathic? Loose and handwave-y?

   If computers existed, could they give instructions to stones? Could sufficiently intelligent animals?
  ```
