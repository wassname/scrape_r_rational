  Uuuuugggghhh.  That was good.  That was **very good**.  Last few chapters felt extremely abrupt, and the transition into Anko's report to the Hokage practically gave me whiplash, but I very much enjoyed the whole experience.

  It goes without saying that you have the best Orochimaru I've ever seen, period, and I doubt I'll ever find one that I like more than your's.  He was a bit like [HPMoR!](#s "Quirrelmort") in that his arguments were so persuasive that I sometimes found myself overlooking his less-than-ethical deeds and sociopathy.  He differed from him in that he (seemingly) did have a Ruthless Utilitarian ethical model that was effortless for him to follow because of his sociopathy, and he seems to be utterly devoted to pushing humanity forward and keeping it alive.  Every time he casually drove a semi-truck through Team Anko's plans, just oozing that "one level higher than you" swagger, I couldn't really feel all that upset.  This was true despite the fact that the part of my brain that was comparing this story to all the other pieces of fiction I've experienced was just kinda yelling that the antagonist was **not** supposed to be this utterly superior, and that clever plan-wrecking was the purview of the protagonists.  For consistently achieving that sense of narrative wrongness, a solid gold star for you.  

  A bit disappointed to see it end here.  It does make me desperately want a sequel to explore the sheer number of interesting plot threads left unresolved.  I do really want to see more of Orochimaru doing his thing and actually turning out to be the hero that the world needs, to everyone's awkward realization.

    Thank you, I'm glad you enjoyed it. I wasn't 100% satisfied with the chapter where they return to Konoha, but I kept staring at it, unable to figure out a better way to do it.  I suppose I could have shown her kicking Cat into the wall, but that felt better as a noodle incident.

    > It goes without saying that you have the best Orochimaru I've ever seen, period, and I doubt I'll ever find one that I like more than your's. 

    Thank you so much, that's really flattering.

    mmmm...so-so.  He's actually driven completely by self-interest, but he recognizes that helping everyone *else* stop fighting is the best way to promote a safe and non-distracting environment for himself.  That's why he's got no problem killing the scientists if they fail to keep the kikai alive.

    Thank you...I think?

    Maybe there'll be a sequel.  For now, I got to the end that I wanted to get to and I'm going to take a break from it.  If I do pick it up again my initial focus would be on Naruto and the Fox, but Orochimaru is so much fun to write that he'd definitely be there.

      *Blinks* Your intended end from the beginning was Naruto mostly succumbed to the fox and trapped in Sound while the rest of the party is home, Hinata still having the same home problems that a lot of this happened because of, and tons of outstanding plot threads?

      That seems like a particularly weird target end state if you have no definite plans for a sequel in mind.

      I would be interested in seeing how the other Sanin are like, given they are O's closest thing to peers...

        I might do a short thing about them at some point. My headcanon version is that:

        -  Jiraiya is more or less a match for Orochimaru in terms of cunning but has different priorities--he's ruthless and Konoha-uber-alles but not psychopathic. He fights with ninjutsu and seals, showing a preference for indirection.   

        - Tsunade is smart but not on the same level as her teammates, and lacks their ambition. She is, however, by far the most dangerous of the three in close-quarters fighting. 

        A fight scene with / between the three of them would be fun.

  I'm glad it was shown in the end that good old Kurama had everyone's best interests at heart. Now he's helping Orochimaru with science!

    ```
    I know, right?  He's such a great guy.

  I really enjoyed all of Team Anko! I liked the level of creepiness that the Demon Fox put out, and the way the worldbuilding was revealed. I'd read a sequel. Thanks for writing such a great story.

  Thanks for this story. The last few chapters were a perfect guide to "how not to play Black Crusade" XD.

  One note about Japanese: they don't say "doctor-san". Doctors, along with teachers, writers etc, have their own honorific - "sensei". When you are addressing a doctor, you say "(name)-sensei", or just "sensei". Profession name, 医師 (ishi), isn't used in addressing.

    What is Black Crusade?

    Thanks.  I've updated chapter 9, 12, and 18 to fix that.

      Black Crusade is a Warhammer 40k tabletop RPG centered on followers of Dark Gods. Players often bargain with demons, and one of the keys to survival is to know how not to screw yourself with such pacts.

  Alright...now that this ride is over, I need to know more about TA Kurama. Please eaglejarl T_T

  How sincere was he? Most of his arguments were well put together, but we had a certain lack of context that skewed it heavily in his favor in a lot of instances, making them SOUND very persuasive, but, if examined, you realized their foundation lies in evidence you're getting from the person trying to persuade you. Big no-no. 

  Does he actually like Orochimaru as much as he seems? Is he sincere about being here to help save humanity from itself? I gots to know!

    > Alright...now that this ride is over, I need to know more about TA Kurama. Please eaglejarl T_T

    [Enormous spoilers.](#s "Kurama was not a good guy, no. He didn't kill people because they were evil, he killed people who lived in ninja villages in an effort to breed the 'be able to be a ninja' genes out of humanity. He didn't generally bother killing civilians, but that's more along the lines of how people generally don't bother killing squirrels. He was not helping Naruto, he was manipulating him in order to win steadily greater degrees of freedom. He didn't give a damn about Team Anko, but claiming he did was what let him keep Naruto from pulling him back down into the mindscape and locking him up again. As long as he had to pretend to be nice to them he was going to have fun messing with their heads -- hence the whole 'well, I could teach you jutsu or we could go bathe in the blood of your enemies, either one' comment. By the same token, Kurama doesn't care about Orochimaru, except as another stepping stone to freedom. He does have a small amount of grudging respect for him, though.")

    Oh minor thing: at some point I was asked "why does Orochimaru call Anko 'little bird'?"

    Simple: snakes prey on little birds.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Alright, that makes sense. Kurama did his goddamned job pretty well. I forgot that he didn't claim to be good, in a traditional sense, but he did admit to trying to "purge the darkness from humanity". My question,[](#s "why'd he want to breed out ninja? I'm assuming to eradicate fuinjutsu (or at least, the chakra needed for it) that could keep him and his siblings sealed?")

        Yes?

          There's a spoiler tag afterwards. The classic type with square brackets and hashtag-s. Is it not showing up for you?
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            Huh.  No, it wasn't.  I started experimenting with different browsers and apparently the answer is that it's something about my account.  When I'm logged out of Reddit I see the spoiler bars normally.  When I'm logged in I don't see anything there at all.

            Anyway, to answer the question:  yes, that's it exactly.

  Important drop today, and it was ready early so I saw no reason to wait.

    > Why was it funny that Shino and Hinata weren't going to be allowed to see their families?"

    I suppose it's funny in the sense of "Imagine the face on Hiashi when he hears about that!", and how Hinata's family is abusing her..

  Don't forget to change the story's status from `In-Progress` to `Complete` in FanFiction.net's interface. Some people filter incomplete stories from their browsing.

    Thank you, done.  I also bumped the rating from T to M and put a note in the description about the M being due to combat and cursing.

  Thanks for the fic.

  Nice pun at the end, there.
