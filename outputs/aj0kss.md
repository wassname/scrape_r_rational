## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  Before writing *Worth the Candle* I was working on a completely diegetic MMO world, one where all the common MMO game design tropes (parties, guilds, levels, crafting, skill trees, etc.) explicitly existed in-universe as part of the texture of the world, known to the inhabitants. Most of those would be recontextualized as magic of one kind or another; there's a specific spell that everyone knows which will put them into or remove them from a party, another spell that will structure a guild, and so on. This has some (IMO) neat knock-on effects. For example:

  A party consists of a minimum of three people and a maximum of seven people. Parties are formed by mutual consent, such that you have to consent to being in a party, can leave at any time, and can be kicked by a majority of the party. It's common for magical effects to extend only to party members. Party members always know where you are at any given time. Party members can also telepathically communicate with you. You can only party with people in close physical proximity, but the party connection will persist even if you move far away.

  This works fine for adventuring parties, which is the intended purpose ... but *families* end up using it too, so that a parent can keep track of their children. It's also a tool of managers to keep track of their employees and communicate with them at a distance, either on a permanent basis, or with the party created at the start of the day and dissolved at the day's end. There can be networks of parties to take advantage of the telepathy, meaning that a party of messengers can potentially get a message to six other extremely distant locations, and other parties of messengers at that location might mean that with 7 parties of 7 you can get the message to ~40 places at once (albeit with a lot of setup). Prisoners can also party with guards (presuming that the spell defines consent in such a way as to allow coercion) as a way of depriving them of the advantages of a party, as well as to monitor them (they can drop from the party whenever they please, but that's still a useful canary).

  Other MMO game design tropes that you think would be interesting to make an explicit part of the world? Ones you think would be particularly challenging to bring in without warping the world beyond all reason?

    Ooh I'll have to think about this some more when I've got more time! How about item/money drops from monsters? Instances? Monster respawns, player respawns? Mainline quests? NPCs? Patches/updates? Do ANY of the above exist?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:

      NPCs don't exist, at least within the fiction of the world; part of the "point" is to make everything a player would experience be equivalent to everything that a real person that exists in that world experiences. Obviously if you were making it into a real game you would likely need NPCs, but they're not a part of the fiction, in part because I don't find them to be terribly interesting.

      (If they were part of the world, they would be as immobile, ineffable spirits with particular wants and needs that could be satisfied by giving them goods or providing them with services. For example, a spirit that would give you a copper piece for an apple, with a limitless supply of copper pieces and inability to be satisfied with any number of apples. This creates some economic distortions and allows things like, for example, the creation of apple orchards right next to the right NPC, which is only mildly interesting to me.)

      Monster respawns? Definitely, with human (or other races) settling in those areas where there are no monsters, or where sufficiently rare/powerful magic can be employed to remove the respawn effect (it should probably be taken as a given that the static nature of MMO worlds is an artifact created by the costs of limited developer/artist time/budget, though maybe you'd be tempted to leave it in if you were going to properly explain every element of the game design).

      Player respawns? Probably, though I'd want to have it tweaked as much as possible so that it's interesting, and so that there's a great element of risk/tension than there is in a typical MMO. If we *also* take as a given that MMO worlds are supposed to represent larger worlds than they actually are (e.g. Stormwind is supposed to be a city of thousands rather than dozens), then maybe "death runs" where you have to get back to your corpse (with all your stuff) actually do represent a significant malus, days of travel rather than minutes. "Your stuff stays on you when you die and can't be recovered by anyone else" is an interesting trope as well, but hard to reconcile.

      How about this: there exists a spell which will bind all of your personal possessions to you, so long as they stay within a meter of you. It takes twenty minutes to perform. When you die, all your bound possessions will be shunted into an extradimensional space, awaiting your return (or failing your return, they'll be lost forever). There exists a *second* spell which will bring you back from the dead at a safe location, though these safe locations are incredibly difficult and time-consuming to build, meaning that they're only constructed by large cities and/or nations. When you die, you have to personally make it back to the location of your death in order to get the stuff there. If you die a second time on the way, the stuff from your first death will be lost forever.

      There are *tons* of knock-on effects from that, because we have to imagine this being the case for *everyone*, from the leaders to the armies to the middle classes and those living in abject poverty. We can maybe curb the effects slightly if we posit that there's some non-trivial cost to the resurrection-at-a-safe-place spell (aside from just the time taken to run back), but it's still a lot to take in. What systems develop if everyone knows those are the rules? Is it even relevant outside of normally high-risk occupations? Or do people simply compensate for the reduction in risk by the creation of some new occupations which take up the same position? How do the courts handle "death" versus "real death"?

      I would probably include monster drops in the form of either "essence" of some kind, which can be used for crafting/trade, and/or a spell which can swiftly extract some amount of materials from slain monsters at the cost of some other materials. Imagine a spell that would completely butcher a deer corpse for you and remove the skin into rectangular pieces, but remove the offal, bones, blood, etc.

        What? No!

        Humans settle in areas *around* the monster respawns. Gotta exploit that free XP source.

        If there's an area where skeletons have a tendency to spawn, humans will want to wall off that area (or parts of it) and shoot the skeletons from a safe distance, or better, herd them into minecraft-style traps. If there's a spot where a single Silver Dragon repeatedly respawns, people might build a bunker with a bunch of ballistae / cannons near the spawn point.

        (something similar was suggested a few times in Glimwarden discussions, I think)

          Ah, the base assumption I'm working from is that the world is essentially covered with monsters, and there are only a few places where the monsters don't spawn/go, a sea of black with a few points of light. If you're not in a safe zone, monsters will spawn in your closet or under your bed.

          If you instead take the base to be a sea of white with a few black points, you get a very different world, one where it makes sense to go just outside where the monsters are.

          And yes, if you were going through all this work, you'd probably want an explanation for why, if there's something to be gained from killing monsters, the process isn't just industrialized and made into something that small parties would never actually do, but that's a tough one. (With several solutions, but still.)

        There will be a cost, because whichever nation built it will want their money back. You'll respawn inside some sort of prison complex, from which you can only be released once a friend or relative (you *do* get a phone call) pays the Respawn Cost, which is exorbitant. (Alternatively, you *could* use your one phone call to get a lawyer to make alternate arrangements - or you *could* try to break out, but then you get a warrant issued for your arrest).

        If you didn't want to pay the Respawn Cost, the administrators say, you shouldn't have gone and got yourself killed.

        Spies, on the other hand, can presumably tie themselves to their own nation's Respawn Point and kill themselves to snap back there if they've got an urgent message to bring home. (That is, if they can't just communicate it to a party member back in HQ).

        If stuff that was with you when you died is lost forever if you die again before retrieving it, then that makes an interesting way of permanently destroying something (like secret documents) - if, on the other hand, it is simply returned to the real world at the place you were killed when you're killed again, then that adds another interesting wrinkle to spy dramas - a spy, almost caught, might suicide to get home and then have to return to the site of his suicide in order to obtain something secret *before* he gets killed again (while the enemy country wants to kill him again in order to obtain whatever secrets he had at the time).

    Log Horizon is kind of similar. The game mechanics aren't ever justified, but the plot makes a big deal of how interacting with them as part of the real world leads to some very interesting stuff.
