## [Challenge Companion] Flaws

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread to the [weekly challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/acernf/biweekly_challenge_flaws/?). Post ideas, comments, recommendations, or general chit-chat here.**

Special note: the next challenge, **Endings**, will be the final challenge.

  I’m sad to hear these are ending, as I still haven’t worked up the courage to enter any, and I think some really great short stories have come out of it (including the last winner). It may make sense to edit out the “add a prompt” section in the main post, on another note.

    I'm sad about this too.  I entered two of these, but I could have entered more; I just took it for granted that I'd have other opportunities, every single time.

    I'm going to enter this one and the next one.  I hope you do too :)
