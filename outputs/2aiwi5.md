  Wow. I didn't see that coming.

  [Ch. 50](#s "Wow, Afi being a diplomancer I get, but him showing up in person? Oh dear, but isn't this an unnecessarily risk on his part? He could be walking into a Diplomancer duel his past self would regret.")

  [Ch. 50 Speculation](#s "Does Afi have a backup in place to ensure that the unlikely event of his diplomancy fails and he's the one turned? I'm thinking that there would be a long-ish term attitude-adjusting spell which, when ended, would return the character to their original attitude, thus cancelling any diplomancy done in the meantime.")

  [2YE Reason](#s "Are we about to see the actual *reason* for Flobbovia's leader lottery? By having a leader outside of the game, the landsguard no longer have to worry about a diplomancer becoming the cliche evil regent and essentially taking over the country!")
