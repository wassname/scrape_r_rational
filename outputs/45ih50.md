## New chapter of A Voice Across The Void [WIP][rationalist!star wars]

### Post:

The new chapter is [here](http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/138812496312/ch-8-fragile-things). Previous chapters are [here](http://zoltanberrigomo.tumblr.com/post/133818575647/a-voice-across-the-void). 

This is a very short chapter, mostly because of pacing; the plot needs to inch along slightly before the start of chapter 9.

  To offer a counterpoint, I think that the focus on a single court's politics is the reason that I check this story for updates so frequently. One of the biggest flaws in the Star Wars EU is that politics happens only on the galactic scale. Exploring what it means for a planet to have a change of regime is really interesting to me.

  (The specter of Kreia in the background is laughing at the idea that the planetary politics are somehow separate from galactic politics. But from my point of view, the scope of the plot doesn't have to escalate to cosmic-level-threats in order to be interesting. That is doubly true for stories where there's only 9 published chapters.)

  So much suspense. I really want to see how this will turn out.

  Still enjoying the story, looking forward to the next chapter.

  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    > Author, please. Please make a story world that I care about, with characters for whom I wish either success or failure. 

    I understand where you are coming from, but, strange as this may sound, your request is unreasonable. I am writing about a world *I* care about. This may be a world you care about, but maybe not. It really depends on whether we care about the same things. 

    I care about court politics and crushes old and new. I care about the experience of being torn apart, having your reason and emotion at odds. I do not care about "taking a level in Badass." 

    Let me turn your request around. Perhaps *you* should be the one to write something about a world that you care about. You are the only one who can do it right.

        > If I feel this way about the story, it is unlikely I'm alone.

        You are not alone. I too feel like the story has yet to deliver on its implicit promises. That said, I still maintain enough of an interest to continue reading, and there is potential for the current plot to resolve in an interesting way. 

        Take for example the end of the previous chapter: I think that it can be classified as what /u/ZoltanBerrigomo calls "having your reason and emotion at odds", which fits with what I expect from a /r/rational fic about a Jedi having a crisis of faith (among other things). Of course that particular instance can more accurately be described as crushing victory of emotion over reason, but you can't deny that they're technically at odds in the scene. 

        Perhaps this whole current plot is building up to re-examination of Jedi stance on detachment and how the situation would have developed if the protagonist didn't have an attack of hormone-induced motivated cognition. Perhaps we will see a more thorough exploration of utilitarian ethics and consequentialism, and how actions that make one feel like a monstrous villain can still be the best course of action from a wider perspective, not to mention how the dark side of the Force factors into this. It looks to me like /u/ZoltanBerrigomo *is* interested in all of that, so I'm mildly optimistic.

        I hope you'll understand if I don't reply to all of the above.

        An opening about a padawan who discovers forbidden teachings may be leading in to a story about using these teachings to grow in strength and overpower all who stand in his way; *or* it may be leading in to a story about being conflicted about said teachings and having to make genuinely difficult choices to reconcile them; *or* something else entirely. 

        It sounds like you became convinced one of these possibilities would take place and grew disappointed when the story turned out to be different than you expected. I'm sorry for it, but the fault is entirely yours for leaping to a conclusion that was not warranted. 

        >I'm saying I thought this was a different story. I expected Sith and Jedi Code to collide early and often. I expected a witch hunt for a heretic, a ideological struggle between students and Masters, or a growing Sith crisis and a test of faith between a system of order that hated change, and chaos, freedom, and truth offered by people driven mad by the same.
        >That was my expectation based on what I initially read.

        I think that is a lot of (oddly specific) things to expect based on a beginning which can really go in multiple directions.
