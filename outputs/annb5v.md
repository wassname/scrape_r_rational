    I have missed them so much. The returning to "civilization" i mean.

  Only three possibilities I can think of for what's causing the magical problems

  1) Whatever entity Cordelia's pulled out of the lake

  2) The Dead King

  3) A side-effect from what happened to Masego

  It seems like a targeted attack, so I'm leaning toward the first two. 

  >“I say no more,” Ivah insisted. “It sees all. It hears all.”

  The "entity" looking at them might indicate the Dead King; he might be capable of messing with the fairy gates and have relays set up to mess with scrying. Or it could be a Hell Egg that Cordelia's dug up to use as a weapon. A really ancient demon, maybe.

    My guess is that the fairy gate malfunctioning is a side effect of Winter being devoured by Night. They're using Winter powers to make the gates via the Hunt, but now it's a part of Night which is a power of Below, so it opens into one of the Hells more often than not.

    I'm curious how the change to Winter has affected the Hunt. Are they still Fey at this point? Do they still have access to Winter, or is it Night for them as well? Were their oaths made specifically to Cat or to her title which now belongs to the Sisters?

    Also, Cat mentioned that the Sisters flew off from her before she got to camp, and they specifically said not to harm Robber and his people, so it seems they already know the whole situation, so my guess is that the Hunt now reports to them, Larat excluded.

    Kairos and Bard are both definitely worth considering as well, but much less likely than the other ones given that we have no idea what methods they would be using.

    ```
    As mentioned in the sister thread, the Tyrant has declared that his **rule** extends to the very heavens.
    ```

  ```
  I love how Cat, instead of saying "Hey Robber, it's me!", decides to spring the trap even though she's mortal now.
