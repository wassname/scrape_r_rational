  If I had to pick a genre, I'd go with "rational magical realism" - a rare combination!

  Loved it.

    How related are they, given the titles?

      ```
      "[Hexing](https://aphyr.com/posts/341-hexing-the-technical-interview)" is about writing the raw bytecode of a JVM class to solve a graph problem. "[Acing](https://aphyr.com/posts/340-acing-the-technical-interview)" is about an unusual construction for linked lists, and implementing an algorithm for reversing it.

      Both are technical interviews where the candidate is a witch, in both behavior and proposed solutions.

  ```
  The setting feels like a shout-out to His Dark Materials.
