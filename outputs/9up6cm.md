  I’m new to this subreddit. I have been working on a LitRPG story that is rational. I specifically wanted an intelligent protagonist, an engineer, who would be driving the plot through creative use of modern day knowledge in an otherwise medieval society. Yes, they have magic, but (hopefully) one that is restrained by general application of laws of physics (no infinite sources of energy, no perpetual motion.)

  Maybe you can keep me honest and point out where I have gone wrong with respect to keeping the fictional world ‘realistic’ as far as laws of nature, and rationality. Thanks.

  The premise seems interesting, I'll check it out.

      Classic ignore human universals and apply them to different species.. Generic fantasy races. 

      &#x200B;

      Trigger happy, kills or is responsible for the death of 10+ people in chapter 2 alone, wasn't he supposed to be a normal engineer? 

      &#x200B;

      MC's got a time stop item, and will return from the dead infinitely with penalties..

      &#x200B;

      I've already made my mind on this one ;P

        I'm working on revising this particular section about killing the slavers.

        " Classic ignore human universals and apply them to different species." I am not sure what this means.

          Humans have universals of our species, i.e envy, music, marriage, etiquette, aesthetics... Applying too many them to non humans is flawed and makes them look like humans with fur and dog heads. It's a world building issue mostly.

          As an aside, a rational agent would have spent at least a couple of hours figuring out everything he can about his time stop item pretty much as soon as he had the chance. What's the cooldown, are there charges, does it actually stop time or does it freeze his immediate surroundings..

          There are many problems and I only read up to chapter 4. Here's the one that annoys me the most and basically set's your plot in motion. Those gnolls seemed to be living there for a while and in a not small group seeing that there were children and a specific hiding spot for them. But they had no guards, patrols, alarm systems or anything really, I mean they were ambushed in their own cave, that's a bit much.

            I've always believed that a number of "human universals" are really "sophont universals"—things that any intelligent + tribally-eusocial species will *inevitably* evolve as game-theoretic equilibria in natural+sexual selection. (Or, sometimes, something even a [presocial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociality#Presociality) species will end up doing.)

            For a clear-cut example of something we *can* observe on Earth (but which isn't really thought of as a "human universal"), humans manage to—through a combination of physiological and behavioural mechanisms, in the average case—bear equal numbers of male and female children. This *could* be described as a "human universal"... except other Earth species also do it. It's an adaptive trait of a supercategory of which humans are one member species—in this case, that's "K-selected species where organisms of the species have one of two sexes assigned randomly at conception by gene mixing." Any species that fits those criteria, ends up with one or another implicit behavior to balance the sexes of their children (e.g. selective miscarriage, expulsion from the nest, etc.) to exactly the degree required to balance out whatever *natural* ratios of lifetime pre-mating risk the organisms of each sex have.

            For another example, "revenge-seeking behavior" is an elementary game-theoretic building block for cooperation, whether among humans, animals, or AIs. So, you wouldn't be likely to see any tribally-eusocial species that *hasn't* evolved to become enraged and vengeful/uncooperative at an unfair deal.

            (Of course, if you *aren't* writing a tribally-eusocial species, you can make them weirder; and if they aren't even precocial, you can make them as crazy as you like. But at that point, you're writing something it's *very* hard for humans to have much empathy for. This is true even when the species exists in real life! Base an alien species on crows or dolphins and they're already pretty bizarre; base them on the real-life behavior of any truly [solitary animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitary_animal) and you'll have something that really only works as an opaque antagonist.)

            I do understand your point about making the gnolls distinct. They should not be just humans in fur. Gonna add that to my to do list. Thank you :)

            I also would have spent hours figuring out how the time ring works, the mana stone, and the satchel. I would also have talked everyone's ear off asking them questions endlessly, about ALL the things. I'd get all the information I could out of them and more. My issue is how do I convey that to the reader without info dumping them with several chapters worth of information from the start?  People would get bored, there's only so much world building / info dump they can take. I'm all ears as to suggestions :)

            There are no children in that cave through chapter 4, as I far as I recall. And the group was small. The three that came into the cave, got followed and that's how they were attacked. I don't know if they had guards, maybe those three were the patrol. The narrative is first person - so the only information the reader gets, is what the main character sees / hears. Regardless, it doesn't mean if you have a guard / patrol / alarm system that it's 100% effective, especially against a group of rogues.

              I personally really enjoy seeing a character go through the experiments. "Experiment 1 showed me that the time stop device could only be used for a maximum duration of 10 seconds." "Experiment 13 showed me than it has a minimum cooldown of 1 minute." Blah blah. I'm not a writer but I've read interesting breakdowns of experiments going through the thought process of the protag. For example The Waves Arisen had a few scenes that did that decently.
