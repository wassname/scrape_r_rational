## [D] Delayed Sunday Writing Skills Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Sunday thread for discussions on writing skills!

Every genre has its own specific tricks and needs, and rational and rationalist stories are no exception. Do you want to discuss with your community of fellow /r/rational fans...

* Advice on how to more effectively apply any of the [tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RationalFic)?

* How to turn a rational story into a rationalist one?

* Get feedback about a story's characters, themes, plot progression, prosody, and other English literature topics?

* Considering issues outside the story's plain text, such as titles, cover design, included imagery, or typography?

* Or generally gab about the problems of being a writer, such as maintaining focus, attracting and managing beta-readers, marketing, making it free or paid, and long-term community-building?

Then comment below!

Setting design should probably go in the Wednesday Worldbuilding thread.

        Shit, I even read Unsong. I am shamed.

  I find it gets harder to draft, the further into the future I'm looking. A lot of it is that I haven't thought too much about how the characters actually interact that far down the line, and while I know the broad plot strokes, there are things like travel times to take into account.
  Is that a writing challenge specific to serials?
