  Wow, that ending was great. At the start of the chapter I was like "What if Kirielle interrupts the soul healing, did he seriously forget about that?".........I like what he did much more

  Massive catharsis though. Also if leaving means you wake up normally, then we really have no clue who red robe is. Assuming it is not veyers attendant. And i seriously doubt that.

  So plans around plans. We are on to the start of the final battle. Also I wonder were silverlake went :D

    Remember the primordial said that RR couldn't get out without him, implying that he incarnated him in a new death-seal-marked body rather than just shove him back in his old body.  So he could be anywhere.
    ```

    - u/Laser68:
      ```
      I meant inside the loop, he would have continued normally, so unless he was red robe before the looping started, they had no hope of discovering who red robe was when it was still looping.

        Yeah, this pretty much opens up RR to being practically anyone again. 

        Zach's observation that both Silverlake and Zorian were present in later loop iterations means that someone else entirely would have needed to Soulkill Veyers. We know it wasn't Zorian, so that limits it to Zach or (non-Veyers) RR. Zach may seem like a stretch, but we don't know exactly what's hidden as far as any compulsions on him are concerned.

        The main hint we got this chapter is that RR evacuated Veyers and Jornak, which is odd, because those two didn't seem to have much value to anyone. They did minor work for the Dragon Cultists, but I didn't feel that they were too important.
        ```

          > which is odd, because those two didn't seem to have much value to anyone

          I suppose if Veyers was a false lead, then there's value in keeping them guessing. It would have to be an intentional false lead though, otherwise RR wouldn't know about the possibility.
          ```

          - u/Ardvarkeating101:
            ```
            Well RR did wipe zachs memory of Veyers
            ```

            - u/Hidden-50:
              ```
              Good point. It could be that Vayers is somehow connected to RR and they wanted to eliminate the link.
              ```

              - u/CrystalineAxiom:
                ```
                I think it's both. I think that RR wanted to give them a false lead AND RR wanted to eliminate some vital information from getting out.
                ```

        - u/GWJYonder:
          ```
          Not necessarily, remember that Zorian considered the possibility that RR had worked with the Lich, but that the Lich hadn't been able to be made permanent, perhaps because the mark could only be modified in such a way in the first loop it existed in. RR could have given the Lich (or someone else) a temporary mark, and tasked them with soul-killing him the iteration after he left the loop, before their temporary mark lapsed.

          That would require a great deal of trust, as the helper would have to carry out the task without RR's presence. It would also require quite a bit of power, as the helper would have to acquire the artifact that does the loop ejection without RR's help, and with only a few loops to practice.

          It's definitely more likely that Veyer is simply a link between Zach and RR that RR cut some point soon after becoming permanent, but since both Zorian and Zach avoided the rebellion and Cyoria in general for many, many loops after RR left it's technically possible that a helper got him, without Z or Z noticing loop differences from another actor having loop knowledge for a few loops.
          ```

        - u/onlynega:
          ```
          I have a hunch on who RR is now that Veyers is ruled out. Putting this in rot13 because I think it's likely to be close to the mark:

          ```

          - u/CrystalineAxiom:
            ```
            Not even remotely likely. First, that's not how the time loop works. If RR didn't have a marker, he wouldn't have been preserved. Whoever got the marker must have had QI's help. Second, Zach wasn't proficient enough in soul perception to make a simulacrum. Third, simulacrums don't have souls, so none of that is possible anyways. 

            Plus, most of your justifications are already explained by the fact that RR fucked with Zach's mind in order to keep him from figuring out what was going on. The soul killed Veyers was intentionally misleading.
            ```

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      It just occurred to me, panaxeth fighting in the last chapter really showed off his abilities as a fleshcrafter.

      I wonder what he made RR and Silverlake's bodies out of.
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        Or look like, they could be completely different, though I think Silver lake is vain enough too just want a younger version of herself, it would be different enough and it is something she was working towards before the timeloop began, heck it may even have something to do with her initial interest in Panaxeth's prison.
        ```

        - u/CrystalineAxiom:
          ```
          Silverlake is definitely young now. There have been so many hints dropped. First, that was what she was working on when she is introduced. Second, that's specifically one of the things that the Cult of the Dragon Below leaders are hoping to get out of enslaving Panaxeth. Lastly, Panaxeth had to create her a body from scratch. 

          It wouldn't make sense from either a Watsonian or Doylist perspective if she wasn't young.
          ```

          - u/Banarok:
            ```
            sadly i completely agree.

            I'm sad because i didn't come to that conclusion myself

      - u/Silver_Swift:
        ```
        >I wonder what he made RR and Silverlake's bodies out of.

        Ah shit, the Zach Zorian saved is RR in disguise, isn't he?
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Zorian would recognize his mind being fuckey, right?  And he has soul sight.  It's assuming a level incompetence we don't normally see from him
          ```

          - u/Silver_Swift:
            ```
            Zach has mind blank up (he would have put that up first thing in a fight against Red Robe). 

            Soul sight is a good point though. Panaxeth has the ability to put markers on people, but it's possible soul sight allows you to identify people beyond just checking for markers.
            ```

            - u/brnape:
              ```
              Zorian was speaking to Zach via telepathy, so Zach couldn't have had a mind blank on as that cuts him off entirely.
              ```

        - u/NoaTacro:
          ```
          That would require Zach's soul marker to be perfectly copied including damage as it's twinned with Zorian, and that the copy response to the marker ritual even when it's not the original. Zorian to have not noticed mind differences while in telepathy with Zach, can't have been thinking to each other with mind blank up. Also with Zorian's soul proficiency likely require some cover / illusion of Zach soul as well.

          I'm not saying it's beyond a primordial, but it feels like its a bit of a stretch
          ```

        - u/Mountebank:
          ```
          If that were true, then his statement about Zorian and Silverlake being fine in the loop after they left could be false, a lie to cover up RR being Veyers.
          ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      The Primordial might have deleted non-looping Veyers from the simulation, at Veyers' request.

      Though... from a Doylist perspective, Red Robe still having his identity hidden suggests that the revelation of his identity will surprise us readers. (Actually - how sure are we that he's a 'he'? Could 'he' be Silverlake?)
      ```

      - u/NoaTacro:
        ```
        That makes sense, although the inference so far was that RR thought that someone exiting the loop would immediately end the simulation, as he didn't do anything to work against them before leaving.
        That might be explained that he thought there was too big a network to fight and their chances of getting out after him were nil anyway.
        Which hints at Veyers having been excluded from much earlier, likely when Zach's memories were taken.

        The big question is how did RR start, a similar accident to Zorian, already hinted as impossible to reproduce.

        Zach might have been captured early one loop by someone affiliated with the invasion but not apart of it, getting QI's help without having him loop as well doesn't sound that doable though. (For either the crown marker being corrupted or splicing the true soul marker intentionally.)

        Not had any hint toward it, but I think that leaves the primordial as the only enitiy other than QI likely to have achieved a second marker, some corrupting of the monitors laws.

        RR as some one who entered the gate with Zach's help or other means and was contacted by Pax, explains why he was so set on optimizing the invasion without being a direct member.
        ```

        - u/CCC_037:
          ```
          > The big question is how did RR start, a similar accident to Zorian, already hinted as impossible to reproduce.

          Theory:

          Zach, in an early Loop, went to Red Robe (or an acquintance of his) seeking help - for whatever reason. Presumably they were introduced to each other by Veyers. Between Zach and Red Robe, they managed to provide Red Robe with a Marker. Red Robe then betrayed Zach, swiss-cheesed his memory, covered his tracks by removing Veyers from the simulation, and went off to do his own thing...
          ```

          - u/NoaTacro:
            ```
            That's very tidy and likely mostly correct, (barring soul clone or simulacrium shenanigans).
            Big question is how did they replicate a 'true' marker, QI's crown or skill are the likely avenues but doubtful as QI wasn't looped.

            The other big question, why was RR so invested in optimizing the invasion without being a member of those factions, this hints me towards a Panaxath deal requiring it's release.
            ```

            - u/CCC_037:
              ```
              Maybe these two feed into each other - perhaps Panaxeth replicated a marker for Red Robe as part of a release deal?
              ```

    - u/TheIssac:
      ```
      I actually think it could be Jornak, think about this, starting every loop with veyers in the house is sure to get on his nerves after the first few times, ending in him using the dagger to soulkill him, so he use the loops more effective. Also Veyers being the only thing linking him to Zach makes it easy to just erase those memories to go undetected. And he took instant charge of protecting the original Jornak and Veyers after coming out of the loop. Which again points at their importance to him. Bevore he left the loop he had no idea if the house was found out by Zorian and Zach, so why protecting it first thing out of the loop if he is not RR. Then again could still be a false lead. But i dont think so..

      Then again how did RR get the dagger... something which took ZZ forever... and he knew about the exit...

      Maybe Veyers because of his poor marks got some help from his friend Jornak to enter the TimeRoom , so he could study and catch up. While doing this they got assaulted by Panaxeth or got in contact with the one, who got corrupted and brougt into the timeloop by Panaxeth. in Chapter 54: its said "the royals are afraid someone is going to steal their sovereign gate  and check up on it constantly " . Which could be the necessary connecion to the dagger. Kinda weird that Zorian never tried to meet one of those royals and mindslave him to bring him the dagger... maybe even Krantin? He is the one doing research on the sovereign gate and thus the most vulnerable to Panaxeth.
      ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Only Zack would wake up normally, as he was the only one who had his soul inside his original body when the loop ended. RR and SL would have their souls transplanted into their Panaxeth constructed bodies at the end of the loop, and would presumably be awake after that. There's similarly no guarantee about where those bodies started. RR had to contact his original self and his lawyer friend to move them.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      I dunno why RR would necessarily contact his old self (unless you're assuming RR is Veyers).
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Yeah, evidence in this chapter suggests Veyers isn't RR. But I believe the comment I was replying to thought that RR would be waking up in the body of his original self, which is what I was refuting.
        ```

        - u/Cheese_Ninja:
          ```
          The comment you replied to was phrased oddly, but he was actually talking about Zach observing how Silverlake and Zorian leaving the time loop resulted in them still being produced as their initial versions in subsequent iterations. As in not soulkilled like Veyers was, which makes RR's identity a persistent mystery, since he's the only one we know of who used the Dagger inside the loop to soulkill.
          ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        the fact that he can make proper use of simulacrums implies he wouldn't kill himself at least, so one assumption you could make is that he wouldn't want himself killed either, even if it's not \*him\*. also Jovank
        ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    To me the ending looks like this: In an effort to create a touching moment, give us readers some deserved warm fuzzies and show us just how far Zorian has developed as a character over the course of this series...

    ...we have Zorian make a decision that will bring Kirielle and himself much happiness for the next ~24hrs before putting her in a huge amount of danger by bringing her *directly into* a city where he will fighting against Red Robe, SilverLake, an immortal cult and a millenial old Lich. Oh, lets not forget that a primordial is also going to be released and likely kill the majority of the cities population if Zorian fails.

    Even if i hand-wave my issues about how this decision impacts Zorians effectiveness it **still fails** to move me as a character moment because purely from the perspective of Kirielle's well being it is massively shortsighted and tremendously irresponsible.
    ```

    - u/onlynega:
      ```
      Disagree. There are some important story beats set up / continued here.  
      1.) Zorian feels A LOT of guilt about being the sole survivor. He's burying his trauma of that and says as much. Before he got out he felt he owed everyone that helped him in the loop, but now it's become acute by recent trauma. You're going to see this affect his decision making going forward, at least in the short term.  
      2.) Zorian cares for Kirielle and respects her wishes even when they may be inconvenient for him. That is growth even if it isn't perfectly rational growth in this moment. He should be more of an adult, but guilt is clouding is judgement.  
      3.) Despite Zorian using the hydra-hive-mind and all of his simulacrums being in alignment sharing thoughts often, they are still independent and have independent actions. The Zorians who were not just playing with Kirielle and are not looking her in the face in this moment would not make this decision, but that is because they literally have distance from it.
      ```

      - u/sparkc:
        ```
        I'm not sure we are disagreeing. While i would not attribute your above thoughts to what the author was thinking or intended when writing the ending of this chapter, if i am to proceed from the basis that i have to justify the ending in a way that has the most internal consistency then i think all your points fit very well.

        The issue is that none of the points work to induce a touching character moment whereby we feel good about how far Zorian has come as a person and brother unless the fact that he is making a really poor decision, based largely on guilt and putting Kirielle in great danger, is supposed to not be spoiled by the fact he cares for Kirielle. You can see how the likely outcomes of his decision work against what the chapter intended from this moment, right?

        This is a moment the story has spent innumerable time building up to and having that moment be 'Zorian makes a really poor decision that greatly reduces the life expectancy of Kirielle because he has clouded judgement and feels guilt...but he wouldn't have made this poor choice if he didn't care!' is not satisfying, in any way at all.

        - u/throwawayIWGWPC:
          ```
          I feel like we aren't asking ourselves the question, "How can Zorian salvage taking Kirielle along?"

          Zorian is close with Imaya, Kael, Kana, Nochka and her family, and Taiven, none of whom stand much of a chance of living if all hell breaks loose in Cyoria. He likely had already made plans to evacuate people like them from Cyoria, so if he leaves Kiri with them then evacuates the lot of them to a safehouse, they'll be fine.

          I don't think this is such a huge deal, though it's certainly a little riskier than shipping her off to Koth with his parents.
          ```

    - u/woodenrat:
      ```
      The city itself wouldn't be too dangerous in general.  He'll need to make things secure in the city anyway to protect his weaker allies like Kael and Taiven who'll be actively targeted.
      ```

      - u/sparkc:
        ```
        The city is where every single enemy he has is likely to be located the majority of the time and *it is where a primordial might be released*. He will be forced to attempt to protect Taiven & Kael but putting aside any potential help they may be, do you truly believe Zorian would choose to have them in the city if their safety and well being was his primary goal?
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Are you assuming that he's going to keep Kirielle there for the whole month? Because I'm not. Sure, he'll take her with him, but he's already taken opportunities to ship her out before.

          That said, it's not like he plans to actually allow the primordial to be freed. That would mean hundreds of thousands of deaths, probably including his own and Zach's. So, Cyoria is risky, yes, but he intends for it *not* to be primordial ground zero.

      ```
      Nah, he would have to do SOMETHING with Kirielle, and having her under watch at the heart of the power of his group is actually a pretty safe place for her. He is only able to ignore his parents because he only has a few days before they are unreachable in the middle of the ocean. Unless he arranged for Kirielle to go with them she'd be stuck all by herself with some family friend in their home town. Whatever arrangements he made to keep her safe would probably be less thorough and more resource-intensive than being able to keep her with people he's already protecting.
      ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      It's not like QI isn't going to try and track his entire family down and slaughter them regardless of where they hide.  Frankly, it's an all or nothing at this point and for Kirielle it's either  a quick death or a front row seat to some pretty cool magic
      ```

      - u/sparkc:
        ```
        The most important point in response to this is that even if this were true, the text (namely the last four sentences of the chapter) clearly indicates that this is not a factor in Zorian's response to this. You can't read 'it was all worth it for that smile' and go 'Zorian realises he is bringing Kirielle into a situation where she could well die but if i, Zorian, fail, then she will die anyway so i might as well bring her into the epicenter of a soon to be disaster zone because she will surely appreciate the magical fireworks'.

        So the character moment is still spoiled because Zorian is making a decision that is reckless and irresponsible and Kirielle is actually about to be in a great deal of danger and the intended warm fuzzies have shrivelled to nothing.

        I also disagree that Zorian with all his power could not hide his family from QI if that was his goal but it's not of great relevance to how the character moment was spoiled so i'll leave it at that.

          Okay, first of all, it's not magical fireworks, it's magical explosions sent between the various dueling archmages that sometimes look like fireworks.  Second of all, stick her at Nochka's, which no one on the opposing side has ever heard of, only visit her in disguise, and stop caring.
          ```

          - u/sparkc:
            ```
            I don't see a world in which Kirielle is safer in a city where all Zorian's enemy reside and a primordial may soon be released and Kirielle needs to be dropped off at a safehouse (an additonal risk, even when in disguise) and then visited in disguise (a risk each time), than a world in which Zorian simply goes 'Hey, i really care about Kirielle, how can i best ensure her safety and wellbeing' and then does almost *anything else* than bringing her into Cyoria. I mean this very chapter mentions that Zorian believes his family will be safe when they're on a ship at sea.

            He is clearly not prioritising her safety but instead her short term happiness and, to bring this conversation back around to the fundamental point, this ruins the intended effect of the character moment.
            ```

            - u/cyberdsaiyan:
              ```
              This moment is powerful because, unlike before, this is the last iteration. He can't loop back to this point and take her to Cyoria in the next restart. This is it. And things are going to change a lot following the battle, so much so that a future visit might be hard if not impossible. Everything is unpredictable because there's no longer the safety valve of a restart.

              Sure, Zorian could do the rational thing and let Kirielle go with their parents. But most likely that would mean that he can't keep the promise with her time loop self, at least not completely. He knows he might die in the coming battles, it's a real possibility. And if he does, no one will ever take Kirielle to see Cyoria.

              This likely won't be the last chance that Kirielle gets to see Cyoria in all its glory, but it might be the last chance that *matters*. (There's also the whole arranged marriage thing to consider, which will likely be another headache Zorian will have to deal with).

                Nothing you have said there in any way whatsoever justifies putting Kirielle's life in extreme danger. Not even remotely close. 

                Yes, if Zorian did not take her to Cyoria his promise to her would be unfulfilled. Her life is innumerably more valuable than that promise.

    Remember guys, Silverlake and Zorian were like always inside the loop. Panaxeth or not, not being inside the loop only seems to prove that Veyers was soulkilled, which only RR and Zach could do. Now what are the motivations of those two to soulkill Veyers inside the loop, that's anyone guesses.
    ```

  - u/Argenteus_CG:
    ```
    Would be a funny twist if it turned out that Red Robe was SILVERLAKE (Zorian didn't meet her until AFTER Red Robe left the loop), and so we don't just have two Silverlakes running around, but THREE: Red-robe!Silverlake, Endgame!Silverlake and Old!Silverlake.

    But yeah, it could be ANYONE. Damien, Zorian's dad, etc... It should be someone we'd HEARD about early on, but didn't meet until after RR had left the loop, and Damien and Mr. Kazinsky seem like decent choices in that regard. Could even be Alanic.

  It's kinda surprising to see RR be a threat again, my thought was that Zorian and Zach had grown so much since the first arc that RR would have been left far behind. But him being an actual threat still -- plus, the continued mystery of his identity -- is a pleasant surprise.

  For all we know his identity is a massive out-of-left-field plot twist, and is revealed to be Benisek or Zorian's other brother lol

      He's a threat to Zach here only because the guy literally only just woke up. Otherwise he would have been stomped.

      Definitely longer. Without Red Robe the invasion simply isn't that effective, and Zach had been fighting off the invasions for decades before Zorian while implying its always like that.

        I'm not certain the loop existed that long. If it did, it's a near thing. Zach's original statement about the length of the loop was "at least 200 times". Mind you Zach tends to die early so that's not equivalent to "at least 200 months." We've seen Zach throw away dozens of cycles, sometimes even on the first day of the cycle.

      he was there for decades. i guess he was aware of the time loop pretty early (in the first 10 restarts) and destroyed zach before he could do anything.

      we have a false impression of him because the only time we have seen him, he was bragging and being careless. He was also not very strong in unstructured mind magic (he could be really good at the structured one,using actual spells). And zach could defeat him in a fair fight (given the huge mana reserve and the overspecialisation of zach, that was not representative of RR strenght)
      ```

    - u/abnotwhmoanny:
      ```
      There's no way to actually tell how long he was in the loop. Could have been from near the very beginning, which according to Zach, was at least 200 cycles before Zorian met him. That's... about 17 years.

    Z&Z were both pretty badly handicapped, and RR had significantly more prep time for both fights. I'm pretty sure in a straight up fight either of them would swat RR like a fly, so I'm sure this is why RR was trying to take Zach out as quickly as possible.

    Would be funny if RR was Silverlake, so now there's THREE Silverlakes running around, RR, Endgame!Silverlake and OG!Silverlake.

    RR is probably someone we knew about relatively early on, but didn't meet until after RR left the loop. Silverlake fits this bill, but so do Daimen, Zorian's Dad, and probably more I'm not thinking of.

    It would be bullshit if it was Benisek, since he was relatively consistent across the original restarts and AFAIK RR didn't really know who Zorian was until later.

- u/I-want-pulao:
  ```
  Real time starts! 

  Alanic and Xvim etc should be safe, since SL isn't strong enough to kill them, and RR doesn't know they exist or are important. Also, I'm honestly scared about Kirielle. The don't forget me dialogue back in Ch 54 (or 53 or something), and now the decision to take her to Cyoria.... Tension.

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      True, but that's on day 2 or day 3 of the month so it's not THAT time sensitive.

        you mean a month where there is no silverlake with possible murdering will? a silverlake who know the identity of everyone of matter? they could all die before zorian see them again
        ```

        - u/I-want-pulao:
          ```
          En fait Silverlake knows the identify of everyone who matters yes BUT she's not strong enough to kill these people on her own right away. So 3 am day 1 of real time is not when Alanic and the others are in danger. It's day 2 or day 3 that they begin to be in danger. SL doesn't know if Zorian made it out, it looked extremely unlikely from her perspective mere days before it was all about to end. Her first priority is herself, so hide away in a pocket dimension and figure out who to kill and who to help. Plus, she's not gonna make simulacrums cuz they'd betray her right away. So she can't engage people in combat. Killing otherwise takes time which means these people aren't in danger from her right now. In a few days, of course they will be! But that gives Zorian and Zach time to assemble and warn everyone too.
          ```

          - u/sambelulek:
            ```
            This is actually a good argument. True, that the first hours should be spent on cloaking herself against divination. But only starting to disable Xvim or Alanic on second day? I find it too lenient. Besides, Alanic is not exactly security conscious person. For a witch that is only slightly less skilled at warding than current Zorian, slipping in and assassinating him on his sleep is a simple matter.
            ```

            - u/I-want-pulao:
              ```
              That's true, Alanic is too confident for his own good and SL is indeed extremely good at wards. Aite, I take it back. Alanic is in danger RIGHT NOW and so is Kael (altough Kael isn't as important to SL or even nearly as powerful or dangerous as Alanic)
              ```

              - u/Ardvarkeating101:
                ```
                Plus SL wants Kael to be okay, or at least Kana to be ok
                ```

        - u/abnotwhmoanny:
          ```
          But Silverlake is incapable of using simulacrums. That means she's limited much more dramatically in the number of actions she can take at a time. At this point, most of the people from the loop aren't really a threat. Taiven? Without the timeloop training? And the one's that ARE a threat, are equally difficult to approach for exactly that reason.
          ```

          - u/Snorca:
            ```
            Alanic is easy enough to kill in his sleep. That's how he's easily taken out each restart without interference. Considering that by the time SL is approached, Alanic's assassination had become a non issue, she's unaware that he's already in threat of assassination.

            Knowing that Zach would likely seek his help once out, Alanic should be a high priority target for her.
            ```

            - u/abnotwhmoanny:
              ```
              Silverlake isn't ancient because she brave and headstrong. She's ancient because she's cautious and shrewd. She doesn't know where Zach is going to show up, but she knows he has simulacra, can be in many places at once, can teleport like a motherfucker, and can kill her.

              At this point all Silverlake NEEDS to do is free her master. As a dimensionalist expert who was studying exactly how to open this particular prison with Zorian and Zach already, she probably has other ideas on how to do that that don't require possible confrontations with a person who's damn near a demi-god and will kill her on sight.
              ```

              - u/Snorca:
                ```
                Being shrewd also means one is vigilant. She would make probes to see whether or not Alanic is a low hanging fruit. Even while she doesn't use simulacra, she clearly still has a familiar (Something I feel Zorian horribly overlooked and SL already has means to monitor her past self through it) that can act very similarly to a simulacrum.
                ```

                - u/abnotwhmoanny:
                  ```
                  I forgot about the familiar. Good call. Wonder if the author remembers it :P  


                  Still even if conceivable it's potentially unnecessary. As a soul mage and a witch her life has been in danger from countless sources for decades. She doesn't hunt people. She hides and she plots. If she doesn't NEED to go fight people, she doesn't strike me as the person who would. Can you think of any time she's fought anyone in the story at all? Besides a random off-hand attack at a child yelling obscenities at her in her yard, I suppose. (She also stops engaging pretty much immediately when she see's that Zorian is competent).   


                  Though we may start chapter 93 with Zorian running across Alanic's corpse. Conceivable. I'm sure if Zorian had more simulacra, he would be out there checking on him already.
                  ```

                  - u/Snorca:
                    ```
                    In my opinion, she stops if she realizes she doesn't have the advantage. If it's an ambush or assassination, I doubt she'd hesitate. Note how easily she threatened to poison Zorian's family rather than to simply kill him. She's not beyond pulling off petty kills if she finds it more convenient.
                    ```

            - u/GWJYonder:
              ```
              However Alanic is only killed in his sleep by a group that made unknown preparations that put them in a position to do that. When their time table is accelerated they are unable to do that and have to do an all out assault. We don't know what exactly happens to let the assassins kill him, but getting through his wards in secret is obviously not a trivial task for them, and the same is probably true for Silverlake.

              Honestly Kael is the one I'm most worried about, but given that he never warmed up to Silverlake for heart-to-hearts it's likely that she doesn't actually know where he and his daughter start the time loop.

          - u/distrofijus:
            ```
            Silverlake is not using simulacrums, but she has her familiar which kinda of can act as a single simulacrum.

            Her soul magic is so advanced that she detected Zorians simulacrum attached to golem frame straight away. 

            To cast simulacrum one needs to have soul awareness / be familiar with the soul so it can be copied. It is not a matter of skill. I'd say it's related to the paranoia - there's a chance that a simulacrum would try to attack her/overwrite her personality via mind magic, something like this. There were some horror stories  Alanic told Z&Z. But the SG-Silverlake has a time limit which may force her use steps she's not doing otherwise. To avoid the death by not getting Panaxeth release, she might resort creating simulacrums (she might have borrowed golem blueprints Zorian uses for his simulacrums).

      SL knows she's no match for Zach, and Zach can leave even if Zorian can't. Going to get her old place and having to fight a 12month older version of herself... while being vulnerable to an attack by Zach... not ideal. She doesn't know and can't trust RR to handle Zach.
      ```

      - u/Laser68:
        ```
        I cannot see any outright arguments against, considering she knows he will actually keep his word, so if she helps him there is plenty of positives with few downsides. Especially considering Ichl wants to unleash the primordial, which silverlake needs to help do.
        ```

        - u/I-want-pulao:
          ```
          only argument against is that QI doesn't trust either, and I don't think Silverlake has dealt with QI that much that she can convince him quickly. Plus, having QI aware of you is a double edged sword - remember when he threatened ZnZ the first time they made the deal after the soul suicide attack? To someone like Silverlake, QI's attentions can be very unhealthy. 

          &#x200B;

          Also, tbf, SL had no clue she was gonna be able to backstab the others and bounce of the loop. So she wouldn't have prepared (I imagine) how to best fight the others. So in her case, might make the most sense to just lay low and figure shit out first.

    I think Xvim and Alanic are less safe then you think, although I don't necessarily think they are in danger currently or already dead. Convincing original SL to come into their side takes time, resources, and doesn't give them all that much advantage in countering loop SL. Xvim and Alanic are easier to convince that they are in danger even if it might take a while to inform them of the exact nature of the danger, and are substantially more useful in combat comparatively. Alanic is in even more danger than Xvim, since RR probably knows he's one of the only living soul mages anywhere nearby, so both escapees have a motive to attack him.

    Warning original SL is sufficient; she has pretty good defences set up already

      A nitpick. Alanic is the only soul mage of sufficient capability around Knyazov-Dveri. For all we know, Cyoria might have a bunch of them. Given that RR is based on Cyoria, it low chance Alanic is targeted by RR. Besides, what motivate him to hunt soul mages?

      Hmm I agree re Silverlake, but I consider the danger to Alanic and Xvim from Silverlake to be negligible (Alanic knows SL, and Xvim is powerful enough at defense). From RR - Xvim should be safe since he has no idea Xvim is anyone, and Alanic... I dunno, attacking the soul mage thing seems to be a Sudomir kinda deal and while I'm sure he wants Alanic dead, he won't drop everything and send a simulacrum to kill Alanic.

    I mean, yeah, obviously it's out of character - the simulacrum even acknowledges that the decision will make the Zorian yell at him. But we've known for a long time that simulacrums can have variations on the original personality. 

    Add that to the fact that the simulacrum was *right there*, having an emotional moment with Kirielle, and I *completely* buy it.

          It's virtually a given that the mana smoothing simulacrum will be in some way interfered with at a key moment, to such a point that I think there's a significant chance of nobody103 deliberately subverting that and having nothing happen. Zorian should really at some point though set up a second simulacrum to do that in a more secure place and dismiss the first. Would make him a lot safer from that sort of interference.

    Yeah, me too.

    You dont have to be 'competence before feels' or 'plot > character' as a reader to have a character moment feel contrived and ineffective because of how a) unbelievable it is, in the literal sense and/or b) how overshadowed it is by the fact that the very decision that is designed to give you warm and fuzzies is a decision that actually is a gigantic -EV decision to the characters future wellbeing.

        She would not be by herself, she would be with the simulcra looking after the family.

        She would also be much much further away, greatly decreasing the likelihood that Silverlake would take the time to come kidnap her.

        If Zorian's decision revolves around doing what's best for Kirielle, there aren't just two options: leave Kirielle at home or bring into the epicenter of all hell breaking loose. The Simulcra can just move her somewhere safe where SilverLake doesn't know she will be.

          Now that I think about it, I think Zorian low-key doesn't care if his parents die here. Sure he talks about wanting to shift them to safety, but then thinks that they might be safer on Koth (no way to be sure). But Kirielle, if she went off with them, would also be out of Zorian's protective area. And I don't think he was comfortable leaving her in a place where he couldn't keep an eye on her.

            Let's be reasonable here. What are the odds the author put in the line about 'being safe at sea' to signify, you know, them being safe at sea, versus signifying that actually Zorian doesn't care whether they or live or not so just conveniently thinks this. The latter would be some great anti-character growth, i'll give you that.

            (If Zorian wants to keep an eye on her he can, you know, leave a simulacrum watching her in a place that isn't filled with every one of his enemies and where a primordial may soon be released).

    Eh, Zorian's shown himself to want to get into the thick of things over and over again, and I don't think that was solely because of the safety net of the time loop. Yeah, it'd be safer to stay behind and do the boring work, but when did he ever do that in the course of the story?

    Likewise, it's wholly in character for him to keep his past promises to Kirielle, he doesn't want to see her disappointed and wants to have her with him because he loves her.

    From a meta level, I would have been very disappointed if Kirielle, a major character in the latter half of the story, had simply disappeared for most of the month because she was on a boat to Koth.

  I absolutely love the characterization of Old Silverlake in this chapter. When Zorian tosses her an item and tells her to catch it, she dodges it, lets it hit the ground, and pokes it with a stick. Doesn't even touch it. Now that's the kind of paranoia we've come to expect from her.

  > "Here. Catch," he said, throwing a small stone disc at her. She did not bother catching it, simply stepping back and letting it hit the ground. She then used a nearby fallen branch to suspiciously poke at it.

  > The simulacrum rolled his eyes at her.

  > "What the hell is this thing?" she asked.

  Then we have Quatach-Ichl, the overconfident millennia old lich, catching Zorian's silver disc and having his soul ejected from his body:

  > "I don't suppose you would accept a bribe to pretend you couldn't catch me?" asked Zorian with as much calm as he could muster, taking out the silver disc Kael gave him and flinging it towards the lich.

  > Thankfully, amazingly, the lich reacted just as Zorian expected him to: he extended his hand and snatched the coin out of the air. Zorian had figured the lich would do that instead of knocking it aside with a shield or something, as he seemed to consider himself invulnerable – not an unwarranted assumption considering those weird bones of his. In any case, the moment the lich's skeletal hand closed around the silver disc he froze in place for a moment before collapsing to the floor like a puppet with its strings cut.

  The dichotomy between these scenes is great.
  ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    do remember context

    Silverlake was approached by someone and she doesn't know their intentions and said person knew where she lived, etc, etc. she had her guard up to 100.

    QI on the otherhand, was an invading party, which was supposed to be a surprise attack, against students, who he already subdued and should not know how to fight a lich, let alone have a counter. Zorian has already mentioned that in almost any other context, where QI would have any guard up, it would never succeed
    ```

    - u/Gr_Cheese:
      ```
      I wasn't being sarcastic, if it came off that way. Like I said, I love the characterization in those two scenes, including the context. I think they hold up well when taken with the rest of the series. Dichotomy might not have been the best word. I liked the throwback, the characterization, and the contrast we had with these scenes.

      Quatach-Ichl is an immortal, Silverlake is nearly an immortal. They both plan to live forever. They're presented with near identical situation: To catch or not to catch?

      Silverlake is paranoid, but not cautious. Caution would have kept her inside her well defended, invisible house when some potentially dangerous stranger started making a racket outside. But she's paranoid and she needs to... define and manage the problem. The same way she needed to harass the time travelers by sending investigators after them, or booby trap her mind and house, or refuse to finish her youth potion in the time loop.

      Quatach-Ichl is straight-forward, and, for whatever reason, is always ready to strike a deal. Maybe he runs a pawn shop in Vegas in his spare time, I don't know. Willing to trade a few divine artifacts for tutoring? Let's deal. Offer to set up a bank heist to rob the Imperials? Deal time. Ambush him and steal his crown? He's mad, but deals will be made.

      Silverlake's paranoia brings her outside to confront Zorian, but it has her dodge catching the stone. She'll poke it with a stick though, and she'll probably fiddle with it later.

      Quatach-Ichl's inner PawnStar has him catch the silver disc and lose his body. Yeah, he let his guard down. Yeah, it won't happen again outside of those very specific circumstances. But that one scene shows us so much about who he is as a person.

        Isn't that because the only valuable thing about his body are the artefacts and the materials that make it? QI is functionally immortal already with that body, excluding any soul magic attacks. I don't think there are many things that he needs to be worried about, so he might as well go "Fuck it".

          Except for the fact that Quatach-Ichl loses the Imperial Crown when he loses his body, and without the crown he can no longer use stall tactics against Z&Z-level threats. Add in the fact that whatever stole that crown is probably going to be on that level, and now has 10x mana reserves, Quatach-Ichl is potentially screwed. That should be the threat assessment going through his head, not "Fuck it".

          But for some reason Quatach-Ichl is literally always willing to entertain a deal in good faith. Even after losing his trump card crown.

    We have her soulless body in the loop where she "left". At the very least, the simplest explanation for that would be that her soul was transferred elsewhere, to a different body.

  God, I'm so hyped for more of this, there is likely only a handful of chapters left and it's JUST SO GOOD. I can't wait to see how everything plays out, how we conclude this very last month, the story should end on the day of the festival, or the day after, and then get a snapshot into the future that the survivors create, who survives and what occurs is going to be essential for that future.

  My hope for the ending is a future where Zach manages to do something within the nobility of their country while Zorian rises to power withij the mage Guild, with their knowledge and power they could make a HUGE difference in the world, Zorian's connection to the Arenea and his ability to basically unite them under his rule would be absolutely world changing. Zach's sheer power could make a huge difference, Zach could basically be a nuclear deterrent, he could stand in the middle of court and say, "hey y'all, Don't fight each other, if you do my friend and I will stop you, period."

  Part of me wants some kind of follow up, not a story but something interactive, not a videogame (though that would be awesome), but perhaps a roleplaying game rulebook, the early chapters were heavily DnD influenced but I feel like by now we could write a fully original game based on this world.

    > What are all of your predictions for epilogues and such?

    Zorian makes a flying castle because he promised Zach a portable castle and that sounds like an amazing thing to fly around the country in.

    He invites his whole class/all his time loop buddies with attached Bakora gates to the school and throws a beach party on Koth.  

    This is true because the voices told me so.
    ```

  - u/Snorca:
    ```
    I predict that SL's familiar is going to play a big role. Remember how it had fooled Zorian before as some form of a simulacrum. With all we know of familiars, we know that they're bonded by the soul. We also know from how Zorian's soul perfectly fit his real body, the souls are a complete match, so loop SL is likely also bonded to that familiar and possibly others.

    In other words, the common assumption that SL cannot be in more than one place at a time might be false!

  In a writerly sense this chapter gives me an appreciation for how necessary the Silverlake-shaped wrench in the works is.

  In a world where Silverlake isn't also a threat, things are much simpler for our dear heroes. Yes Red Robe has an army, but they have a ~~Hulk~~ Xvim. The allies and information Z&Z gathered over the course of the loop are resources RR wouldn't know about and wouldn't have much of a way to counter, so far as we can see.

  Silverlake being out, about, and aware of all of those allies and plans makes things a lot more touch-and-go, in a good way.
  ```

- u/CrimzonNoble:

    ```
    However, SL and Zorian would've been recreated this loop anyway after the temp markers expired (for SL) and after the Key activated the check mechanism (for Zorian). So I'm not sure if we still know what happens when people leave the loop....
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      I feel like this is important, Zach just used his authority to fix the flaws in the loop as well, it's possible that if RR was staying in the loop by a abusing a temporary marker than the loop just kept looking for that soul with the temp marker, but since he left with Panaxeth's help then it meant it wasn't there, but after the reset it may have been back, just like Silver lake and Zorian, I wonder if Zach checked.
      ```

- u/Daggerfld:
  ```
  So Zorian's pulling some Sage Mode stuff with his simulacrum to keep his soul in check. Let's see how this goes...
  ```

- u/danielparks:
  ```
  I see a few possibilities for Silverlake:

  1. ~~Panaxeth never actually offered her a way out; it just killed her in that iteration. It claimed that she left in order to increase pressure on Zach and Zorian.~~ (The Guardian says the Gate is barred. Thanks /u/sambelulek.)
  2. She has a new, freshly made body courtesy of Panaxeth.
  3. She found somebody young and fit, and took their body for herself. It sounds like this would  be painful because the soul and body don’t match, but… this is Silverlake.

  Silverlake didn’t go back to her home because she didn’t want to have to fight herself, or deal with an ambush.

  Alternatively, her new body isn’t quite aligned with her soul, so she’s not ready to get into a fight yet.
  ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    Scratch the first out. The Gate is barred again after her supposed leave.
    ```

  - u/es_carva:
    ```
    Regarding 3, I seriously doubt Panaxeth's contract is so easy to bypass. After all, both RR and Silverlake are soul mages and have literally perfect vessels for possession in the real world; it would be the height of stupidity if the primordial didn't take that into account.

    Silverlake isn't a fighter, so I don't think we will see her in combat unless she's desperate. Considering her paranoia, she wouldn't contact QI either; at best she will feed Red Robe the updated intel she has on their common enemy.

    If I was her, while everything was going down with the aranea and Zach, I would be stealing the Sovereign Gate. Why? To prepare the ritual all by herself. She is great at dimensionalism and knows more about the primordial prison than Z&Z. She can likely do a better job than the cultists, who she has little way of trusting or influencing.

- u/vallar57:

  So did Zach catch that Zorian left the loop successfully ir did he live the rest of the time thinking that Zorian was killed and erased by the Guardian? Must have been hell on for him if it's the second.

  Protect Kiri well, Zorian!
  ```

  - u/bludvein:

    ```

    - u/Sunburnt-Vampire:
      ```
      So both of you seem to have misunderstood:

      Red Robe was awake from the start because he wasn't put back in his original body like Zach, he was given a new body built by panaxeth with a death-seal put inside of it to ensure they free him.

      If for example, we assume red robe is Veyers, then there are two Veyers right now, the original (who was probably asleep like Zach), and the Red-Robe version, who went and evacuated Veyers/his gaurdian.

  Wait, doesn't Zack meeting up with Silver lake in the loop mean Veyers probably isn't RR? Veyers was soulkilled in the loop, which they took to mean that his exiting messed with the template used to recreate the loop each iteration. If Silverlake survived in the loop, then unless the specific way he achieved permanence soulkilled his template upon exit, then Veyers probably isn't RR. RR obviously wouldn't be able to soulkill himself while in the loop, and no one would have the ability or motive to soulkill Veyers once he left.

  Zack should make some simulacra immediately. Since only his body is damaged, the simulacra won't be hindered, so it would be fairly close to having Zack be at full effectiveness.

  Also, thing that either I'm not understanding or is a mistake: Zorian said he could sustain 4 simulacra in his hometown (I'm assuming his proficiency with the spell has improved so that he can now sustain another copy with his regen). The whole point of locating Cyoria on the Hole is that it's a massive mana well, meaning mages regenerate mana faster. The author has said elsewhere that the regen is substantial, although I don't remember the numbers. Shouldn't he be able to sustain more simulacra when he is able to absorb mana from the Hole?
  ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    supplementing mana regeneration isn't passive, so he can't do it the whole time. plus if he goes above his natural regen limit with the help of Cyoria's mana well, he'd be tied down to Cyoria or going net negative constantly
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      It's not completely passive, but it's not particularly difficult either since students can do it fairly early on. And he has a simulacrum staying in the area anyways, since he has to coordinate with the Aranea, so I don't see why extra mana regeneration would be something he doesn't take up immediately.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        well, he could be doing it right now as he's carrying Zach to the hospital and when he's not doing anything in particular.   


        his simulacrum is the one dealing with the Aranea and it's still the soul that does the mana regen (and maybe supplementation?) so it'd still have to be main Zorian doing it

        &#x200B;

        can he swap places with the simulacrum acting with the Aranea? maybe. tho also possible dealing with that end would be more active in spellcasting, too and thus no time to do it anyways?
        ```

  - u/sambelulek:
    ```
    4 is the old number of simulacra he can barely support before he moves to simulgolem. 4 is the number he get when he's based in Cyoria. These two facts we know. To find him saying 4 is still the number, we are allowed to make conjecture that he didn't bother to find out the new number.  

    Or the author forgot about regen mechanic.
    ```

    - u/valeskas:
      ```
      > To find him saying 4 is still the number

      He does not say "I can barely support 4", he says "4 is optimal for the task"

      >This was the most he could manage at the moment while still remaining effective. He would be casting a lot of magic in the near future, so he had to keep his mana regeneration rate at acceptable levels.
      ```

      - u/sambelulek:
        ```
        That actually what I realized on reread. Ah, your attention to detail is better than mine. Updoot.
        ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Probably a mistake, yeah. I don't think it's a hard fix though. Let's say he can sustain 4 with the regen he gets from Cyoria. He makes his 4 simulacra, putting him at negative regen, so he's on a limit. Quickly teleporting to Cyoria puts him back in the positive, and the chapter continues as normal.
      ```

    - u/Snorca:
      ```
      There was already a clarification on a difference between ambient mana and personal mana. Tavien noted that using ambient mana in the atmosphere would cause you to get sick and pretty much incapacitated for days. Whether this affects you through a simulacrum or not is unknown.

      Basically, he would need to constantly recharge his own personal mana slowly and use of ambient mana is a really risky double edged sword while time is of the essence.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        you're mixing up shaping/using mana with simple mana regeneration supplementation. the former is toxic and last resort. the latter is expected and basic (chapters where Zorian went up to the frontier to work in low mana region demonstrates the difference in location)
        ```

        - u/Snorca:
          ```
          Pretty sure I'm not. Shaping is impacted when one attempts to rapidly expand the personal mana pool, something that even Taiven admits is too stupid of a thing to do. 

          The last resort method, the one I brought up, is something Taiven had used twice and suffered a few days in bed afterward with a fever.

          Chapter 22: “I hesitate to even bring this up,” Taiven said, breaking him out of his thoughts, “but if you’re really desperate for a short term mana boost, you can always absorb ambient mana faster than you can assimilate it. I’m sure you’re aware of the drawbacks, though…”

          In other words, there's a clear limit on how quickly he can regen without poisoning himself with the ambient mana.
          ```

          - u/GoXDS:
            ```
            well, your first response was misleading with regards to that since it implied using ambient mana for regen \*at all\* was toxic

            even so, while it's not known if Cyrin's ambient levels are below Zorian's safe limit, there's also the question of whether Zorian's mana reserve levels didn't increase enough to accommodate another simulacrum in all that time. so it's not out of the question for either case, really (4 really is still his limit because safe limit is close enough and/or max didn't increase enough or 4 really was nobody103 forgetting)
            ```

            - u/Snorca:
              ```
              4 is the limit due to how much his soul is in chaos. During the airship raid, he had something akin to what seemed to be in the low double digits to fulfill the roles of defending the ship and piloting it.
              ```

              - u/sicutumbo:

                Those simulacra had golem bodies, which he has mentioned halves the upkeep cost. And I don't think it was in the double digits, although I can't remember a precise number being specified.

    A few possibilities. For one thing, Zorian might have already taken the boost from Cyoria into account to begin with.

    Alternately, being in Cyoria means a TEMPORARY increase in mana regen, but it also carries a greatly increased risk of combat and mana usage. So does being in Cyoria actually mean he has more mana to spare? If anything, in this chapter, he's been consistently lower on mana while in Cyoria due to increased need to use it.
    ```

  Zach says Zorian and Silverlake were walking around at the end of the loop, but we know Veyers didn't. 

  Does that imply Veyers isn't RR, but rather someone that RR (or Zach) soulkilled?
  ```

  - u/JusticeBeak:

    Not necessarily, because RR left the loop the same way Zach did, which is different from the ways Silverlake and Zorian did.

        I'm assuming Panaxeth's help was to get the gate interface to recognize Red Robe as the controller, or something like that, which I'm basing on my memory of the gate being sealed after RR left, but not after Silverlake left.

          ```
          I don't think so, hell I'm not sure how RR could actually get to the gate/recognize it as being important if Zach didn't temp loop him and they either they discovered it together or Zach showed him only to be interrupted by Panaxeth

  Just one nagging question. At the very start, with the tunneler toad ability, it says "His body may have been perfectly matched to his soul, but it wasn't the body to which he had anchored the ability to." But hasn't he had the tunneler toad ability for multiple restarts now, and at each one getting his body destroyed, a new one made, and the soul transferred over? Did I miss something?

  But aside from that, great chapter, of course, as always! It's good to see the aranea alive again, and despite the irrationality of it, I'm glad he's keeping his promise to Kirielle and taking her to Cyoria.
  ```

  - u/ththth12:
    ```
    That's because he forcefully took over his old body. In the loop, his soul was transferred by the gate, and since it was a divine artifact, it was likely made to fit perfectly.
    ```

    - u/hallo_friendos:
      ```
      Plausible enough. I'll buy it. (edit: Nevermind, there's an explanation from nobody103.)
      ```

  - u/nobody103:
    ```
    Every time he started a new restart, the ability was lost. It's just that he kept granting it to himself over and over again.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      But I thought it was anchored in your mana, IE attached to your soul?  Wasn't his soul unaffected?  Or are the mana reserves outside your soul somehow?
      ```

      - u/nobody103:
        ```
        Of course they're outside the soul. The soul generates and directs mana, but a person's mana reserves are not a part of it.
        ```

        - u/Ardvarkeating101:
          ```
          Huh, didn’t quite catch that before, I thought personal mana rapidly lost affinity outside the soul, and that’s why they couldn’t replicate it.  If it’s just a body part, maybe stem cells to make organic batteries?
          ```

        - u/GoXDS:
          ```
          so, is it outside the soul but separate still from the body?

          else, QI and reanchoring Zach's soul outside the loop and the loop itself has issues

          if it is outside the soul but separate still from the body, I guess the loop doesn't just bring the soul but the soul + attachments, like the reserves and divine energy frame/blessing?
          ```

          - u/nobody103:
            ```
            Outside the soul but seperate from the body, yes. I imagine a person's mana reserves as a sort of 'atmosphere' held in check by the soul's 'gravitational pull'. A shroud of personally attuned mana surrounding the soul itself.

            Loop doesn't bring over mana reserves across restarts, but it never mattered so I never mentioned it. Zach and Zorian slept through the actual arrival point every time, so by the time they woke up their mana reserves would fill back up to their 'new' normal. Divine blessing is brought over, though, because gods.
            ```

  - u/Snorca:
    ```
    "Without the life force portion of the anchor, the part located in his mana reserves couldn't persist for long, either."

    So we can assume that the time loop did its job super quickly and attached the soul to a body nearly instantly. The problem for Zorian was the time it took to reach his real body and then attaching his soul to it.
    ```

- u/distrofijus:
  ```
  We've seen what is happening and I guess some of the scariest stuff usually is silence before storm.

  The storm here might be Silverlake in her new body. Why is she not doing anything yet? The scariest thing about Silverlake would be - she's adjusting. She's adjusting to her new body Pan had crafted to her. She requested to craft a body with mana reservers like Zach, empathy/mind magic potential like Zorian. Physically very fit. Young. She's not doing anything because he needs to adjust to her new body. Adjust to immense mana reserves, adjust to new capabilities on natural mind mage...

  Silverator will come into scene and there will be bad things happening! 

  I'm thinking Pan-Silverlake came to original house and took the familiar away. Or she's communicating/plotting with original herself via familiar.
  ```

  - u/RRTCorner:
    ```
    Is it implied anywhere that mana reserves and mind magic stuff are linked to the body instead of the soul?
    ```

    - u/distrofijus:
      ```
      It is not. It is linked to the soul. However when RR was looping with modified temporary marker it was either QI and Pan who modified that marker. It somewhat likely that Pan is both Flesh and Soul warper - so it might be able to modify a soul somewhat -  to increase mana capacity or some ability. 

      And there might be some body-soul level interaction which could influence those things. 

      It's a wild guess. Not too likely. Either way, increased mana pool would need some time for Silverlake to retrain herself - some of the spells would be harder to cast. And for mind magic she would need a lot of training (which she might be able to do somewhere in background as well to increase her chances - like kidnap some arranea and practice on them).
      ```

    - u/distrofijus:
      ```
      Actually there are two stages of gaining abilities. The first stage is getting some ability extracted and added via blood ritual - e.g., stuff done with tunneling toad  - https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9x7kcg/rt_hf_mother_of_learning_chapter_92_the_scramble/e9qcus1/


      Since this ability gets attached to the body, it makes sense to Pan able to do it itself - a better alternative for doing via unreliable blood magic/ritual.


      The most kick-ass body we've seen was dragonoids. We've seen some shifters as well.


      So SG Silverlake could have asked for dragonoid or dragon -shifter body (most of the shifters used Pan's essence and that's why shifter kids were used in ritual). In addition to that body, throw in aranea natural ability tied via blood magic (psion or natural mind mage - whatever you call it. Also maybe some other ability which gives larger/max mana pool). If possible, apply copy of divine blessing as well - and here's the Silverator ready to kick some ass.
      ```

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        except natural reserve increase is tied to the soul. otherwise Zach's soul being reanchored to his original body wouldn't work. it's also unlikely Panaxeth can manipulate divine energy. or at least, not given any real reason to believe such. tho maybe we should wait on nobody103 to clarify in that other thread

        also, a shifter is not just about their body but also soul, so unless Panaxeth can fuse the soul, too, he can't grant that much either

        even if Panaxeth could grant such abilities, natural proficiency with said abilities is impossible to achieve immediately. she might be able to learn them much quicker, but even aranea aren't going to be masters in using it at a high lvl at birth or a few days after

  How many simulacrums can RR cast? One for Zach, one for aranea, one (I assume) for Veyers and Jornak with the first two going all out with mana intensive attacks. Plus, he may have had some simulacrums go check up on some other stuff with QI or someone else, cuz he's not labouring under the issues Zach and Zorian are. We were treating RR too lightly it seems.
  ```

  - u/Seyt77:
    ```
    RR might outclass them in the soul magic department for a long time since it's assumed he had learnt under the lich as he is always working with the lich in the time loop.
    ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The number that he can support is a function of proficiency with the spell and mana regeneration. Since mages restore mana based on their maximum mana reserves (regeneration is linearly proportional to maximum mana so that all mages go from empty to fill in about the same amount of time), and Zorian can support 4 at magnitude 8, the maximum amount a mage proficient in the spell can sustain is their magnitude divided by 2, so long as they have plateaued in their mana capacity.

    The simulacrum that got Veyers and his lawyer friend out could have later gone after the Aranea. We don't currently have evidence that RR can support more than 2 indefinitely, which doesn't give any useful information since Zorian can do the same with below average reserves.

  Just wanted to update and memorialize my predictions for red robe (in order of likelihood):

  1. Damien - I think it would be very well foreshadowed if this was the case. Some examples: he's a latent mind mage and Zach was mind raped, Panaxeth did not even bother offering him a deal because Damien is already his agent(or possibly panaxeth intimated to Damien that he was already the agent, neatly explaining Damien's uncharacteristic resolve in ch. 91), and finally, remember that anyone trying to collect all the artifacts would almost necessarily come into contact with Damien. From the very beginning of the story Damien was built up a lot as a famous explorer/treasure hunter, that is exactly the kind of person you would give a temp marker to if you were trying to collect the keys to the Sovereign Gate. And it would even be kind of ironic given that without his sacrifice in ch. 91 Zorian could not have escaped the loop.

  2. Zach's rebellious simulacrum(or some other kind of Zach doppelganger) - There is not much evidence, other than some stories of rebellious simulacrums and the unfired zach mind rape chekov's gun, so mostly a pet theory. It would be interesting though. 

  3. One of the female classmates - Goes along with the 'Zach was evil/powermad and mind raped into being good' theory. Would square in with the Veyers thing also, make it not a red herring (maybe Zach soul killed Veyers and this caused RR to rebel?). It would be dramatic, but not very satisfying. 

  Anyone have any off the wall theories?
  ```

  - u/hallo_friendos:
    ```
    Oh, sure, I might as well do that too.

    List of things we know about Red Robe:

    * has a fancy magic robe worn by inner members of the cult, even when Zach is still waking up
    * has access to the dagger in Eldemar's treasury
    * can make simulacrums, has soul sight, and can do some mind magic, at least after looping for a while
    * might have needed a temporary marker placed by Zach, which would also mean Zach having access to the crown

    Here's my own list of suspects, roughly in order of most likely to least:

    Whats-his-face, head of the mage guild and known to be a leading member of the Cult of the Dragon Below. We have good reason to suspect RR is in the Cult's inner circle, and if I recall correctly, this guy is the only one of those who was actually mentioned by name. ~~He would almost certainly have found out about the time loop when Zach was telling literally everyone~~ (edit: that was after RR had wiped Zach's memories, so nevermind), and quite likely has the magics that we know Red Robe has. As a high-ranking person, he might have had access to the dagger, though that's a bit of a long shot. The main things against this are the lack of connection to Veyers and the way he hasn't been mentioned enough in the story for me to remember his actual name. (There's a small chance Veyers leads to Jornak which leads to the Cult of the Dragon Below, and RR scrubbed Zach's mind just because him using Veyers as a link to the cult was inconvenient in some way, even though it didn't actually lead all the way to himself, but this argument applies equally to pretty much everyone except Jornak.) For another point against, Zorian does say they've investigated all the high-ranking members of the cult and none of them are obviously Red Robe (ch 63, near the end), though this doesn't necessarily rule anything out.

    Any other high-ranking cultists - all the same arguments for, but pretty unlikely narratively because we haven't even heard of them.

    Novelty standing on Notchka's shoulders - we never saw it coming.

    Quatach-Ichl - He'd have to be pretending to be two separate people, himself and a looper. I'd be surprised if he couldn't cast a simulacrum, and as far as we know all we've seen of Red Robe could be simulacrums. ~~(I wonder, do simulacrums of QI look like flesh-and-blood people rather than skeletons?)~~ (edit: We saw QI's simulacrums in CH 83 when he was helping steal the dagger, and there was no comment about them not looking like a bag of bones, so presumably they do. This doesn't really tell us much though because we know QI can disguise himself.) He also probably wouldn't have too hard a time getting the dagger. One point against is that he doesn't seem like the sort to enter a death pact with a primordial, but then again, he wants to release the primordial anyway, so he has basically nothing to lose by accepting. It's a choice between dying at the end of the month or surviving to reach the real world and be able to affect stuff that actually matters. ~~(It occurs to me, for any of the temporary loopers who thought Panaxeth was the only way out, accepting his deal would be strictly advantageous. You get to live for one month longer, and can work against him the whole time, then die at the end of the month after helping stop his plans. (edit: Hah, I thought I was clever for figuring that out all on my own, but turns out Kyron thought of it first.))~~ Now that I think about it, the complexity penalty from all the pretending he would have to do is really the main thing keeping this unlikely. (edit: The pretending might be harder than I thought, if he wasn't lying when he said "Personally, I'd have gone crazy in a matter of weeks if I had to impersonate a complete beginner at magic for several years" in Ch 81. RR is pretty close to a complete beginner compared to QI.)

    (edit: forgot about Zenomir. Being able to recognize the necromancy spell makes him a little more likely than average, but we don't have too much information either way)

    Sudomir - we've only ever seen him after RR left, so we don't know enough either way. Given his obsession with his wife, he probably would have been more focused on other things, so not a likely RR candidate.

    Jornak - all he really has going for him is Veyers and being a member of the cult, but he does seem like the single most likely person to soulkill Veyers.

    Tesen - he has no reason to let Zach beat him up every time except as some sort of elaborate cover. He's lacking enough in the morals department, and as a seventh-circle mage and a member of a noble house he might have access to the dagger and spells RR was seen using. He might even have gotten a temporary marker before Zach found out what had happened to his inheritance.

    Anyone below here I rate as **less** likely than a random mage to be Red Robe:

    Xvim - too competent. That mind magic attempt? Not good enough. Start over.

    Alanic - doesn't seem like the sort of person who would make that bargain with Panaxeth

    Silverlake - surely Panaxeth wouldn't have sent a second copy of her when she already has so much trouble getting along with herself.

    Taiven, her friends, Ilsa, Imaya, Kael, Zorian's other classmates - too much interaction with them while Red Robe was still in the loop

    Fortov - what a failure at life.

    Veyers - doesn't explain how he got soulkilled (edit: come to think of it, it might be possible for the Guardian of the Threshold to have sent him back Zach-style rather than Silverlake-style, in which case there would be only one of him in the world, and we don't know whether he would have looked normal or soulkilled afterwards in the loop)

    Daimen - wrong continent, no motive, and quite unlikely to have encountered Zach at all before Zach and Zorian met up.

    Zach's simulacrum - I would expect the gate to recognize it as not a real person and refuse to recreate it in the next loop, plus we don't even know that Zach was able to cast simulacrum before meeting Zorian, plus it doesn't even have a separate soul to put any sort of marker on, plus Zach doesn't have soul sight and RR does, plus both Zach and RR seem to both have pretty good control over their simulacrums

    (Wow, that was long. Oops.)
    ```

    - u/AuthorBrianBlose:
      ```
      Simulacrums don't have a separate soul from their original, so they couldn't be replicated in the time loop.
      ```

      - u/hallo_friendos:
        ```
        Yes, that's why I listed that as the single least likely suspect, less likely than picking a random mage off the street. I wouldn't have bothered to mention the idea if there weren't so many other people who seemed to think it was possible, and it's mostly just on there so that I could put it near the bottom.
        ```

  - u/myyx:
    ```
    i want it to be the academy's principal - there's surprisingly no interaction with him  which is strange as i would imagine he's a fairly competent mage to have attained the position.  zach would definitely have tried to convince him.  it is possible the principal is away or something but it would be strange because of the merry-making that is going to happen due to planetary alignment.  

    also, this would certainly explain why RR had the ability to subvert all the academy's wards neatly (although this could just be from years of being in the time loop) and explain the robe itself: many of the order of the celestial dragon were highly placed mages in the city.

    this would make veyers sort of a red herring which is pretty funny.  veyers might have been soul killed for annoying the principal about trying to get back into the academy and taken out just for that. (doesn't explain why he would bother putting effort into helping him the real world though)

    finally, it could explain the cranium rats (as RR was a mind mage). it was mentioned that there were several swarms around the principal's office.  what if it wasn't to spy on him but because that's where the swarms' leader/handler was?

    the biggest flaw of this theory, however, is that zorian didn't mention the principal when he found out who the leaders of the order of the celestial dragon were.  if anything, zorian mentioning the mage's guild leader makes him a suspect for similar reasons (zach would have tried to recruit him in the past as he is a strong mage but is little mentioned until finding out he is part of the order of the celestial dragon, explains how he has his signature robes so quickly at the start of a restart as well as why veyers was soul-killed if that is how he initially was introduced to zach, he would probably know the academy's ward scheme as the highest ranking mage official in the city), but it just doesn't feel as clean.

    edit: veyers explanation, some extra reasons why RR is actually probably the mage's guild leader and some wording.

    Damien is too far away. he's over in Koth and RR was able to attack Cyoria Aranea pretty much immediately. unless you can come up for some explanation for why Damien would be anywhere close enough to simply teleport there and start attacking
    ```

    - u/Kachajal:
      ```
      We don't know what unknown capabilities he might possess. Damien was shown/told to be more talented than Zorian. Imagine Zach meeting him while searching for the keys and (as Zach does, he's shown himself to be reckless like that) giving him a temporary marker.

      Damien then has a year of looping. Maybe Zach comes to him, maybe not. Then his time grows ever smaller, and he searches for a way to extend it. He either contacts or gets contacted by Panaxeth. 

      At that point, we can safely assume that distance is no longer a factor - especially if Panaxeth *wants* RR to be in Cyoria, for some reason. Such as, perhaps, to have RR learn how to optimize the invasion.

      Even if we assume that it's not that convenient and Panaxeth cannot just will Damien to start elsewhere inside the loop, then Damien would still have 20? years to deal with that issue. Zorian mostly solved it within 5?. 

      But what's most convincing for me is the mention of Damien's latent mind magic. *Someone* screwed with Zach's mind, and we know of no other way to do it. Now, it's quite possible that there's structured magic for that, but we haven't been shown it. So I *think* that that's good evidence for Damien being RR.

      (Of course, any other candidate for RR would also have those ~20 years to find some other way to erase memories. But that would be so unsatisfying, wouldn't it?)
      ```

      - u/Quetzhal:

          ```
          Sure, but they also have neat looper-specific powers that he might have wanted to get. 

          Though it's still unclear just how much knowledge he had when he was dropped into the loop. It's possible he knew that the keys existed and of their use and was a "proper" looper, or it's possible that he had no idea even before his mindwipe.

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        the point is still the *time* involved along with the distance. unless he found an ancient guidebook to using Bakora gates that takes little to no time/effort/ambient mana, he's not getting back that quickly and easily (and that alone is a bit deus ex). plus, he's (relatively speaking) living the good life and has little to no reason to become RR

         Panaxeth being able to do too much more within the loop is also sketch or else he could just have recruited more people.
        ```

      There is no reason that Panaxeth would have to spawn RR wherever the person woke up normally. In fact, doing it near his prison makes sense.

          It's speculated by Zorian that the loop begins in the middle of the night and not when he wakes up in the morning(possible foreshadowing?). Presumably, if RR was far away in the loop but woke up earlier than Zach/Zorian, it would give him time to reach Cyoria in time. A lot of ifs... but doable.

                Kind of?  Zorian originally thought there had to be a better way but when he sat down with it he realized that it was actually insanely hard to improve and it would take him months/years just to make it take less time than before, let alone fewer people.

                Also, you'd think Damien, who used the Bakora gates to get to Blantyrre, would mention a spell like that if he'd found it.

      That seems too out there. Fortov has no connection to Zach (different year), no particular skills, and he's not apparently a latent mind mage. It's no more likely than any other random person being RR, imo.
      ```

  - u/Anqied:
    ```
    Because RR was the first looper to leave, the gate was not barred and he did not have to gather all the artifacts. We know he must have had the dagger, since he soulkilled the aranea and presumably Veyers. He therefore wouldn't have needed to seek out Damien, though he might still have done so.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      My theory is that that before Zach was mind raped, he tried to gather all the artifacts, maybe for a specific reason, maybe just for the hell of it(which would certainly fit Zach's personality). We know he almost certainly had the crown and gave people temp markers. Why wouldn't he go for the full set, even if only for curiosity's sake? In his search for the scepter in Koth, he came into contact with Damien, gave him a temp marker, and damien came into contact with Panaxeth, and accepted his bargain.
      ```

- u/Lajamerr_Mittesdine:
  ```
  Here's my guess for who RR is.

  I think it might be the man that Veyers was staying with. Besides shape(Which can be changed), he fits some of the criteria for RR candidate. Veyers can't be RR because he was soulkilled. SL was moving around in the following loops after she left the loop. Whereas if it was this man then he was also moving around as well in each of the following loops.

  Next Veyers and the man in the real world made different actions, so something must've changed. It has to be directly related to them.

  I think that once he left the timeloop and he went and found himself and Veyers. He probably showed up as himself in front of the real him and Veyers and spooked them a bit, but told them they need to go into hiding or to follow him to a safe place.
  ```

  - u/Arno_Nymus:
    ```
    I don't think you are necessarily right. Silverlake, Zach, Zorian and Red Robe left under different circumstances and after Zorian left the loop was restored to its original version. The absence of the soul inside the loop still makes Veyers a likely candidate.
    ```

    - u/Lajamerr_Mittesdine:
      ```
      Silverlake and Red Robe left under similar circumstances right?

      Panaxeth got them out of the loop.

      I'm not sure if this important or not but I wonder if Veyers was restored back to normal and walking around just like Zorian and Silverlake. Also the aranea that were soulkilled. If the soulkilled ones were still incapacitated I think that proves Veyers is not Red Robe.

- u/nohat:

  So excited to leave the loop and get things running. I'm upgrading my estimate of the (otherwise low) possibility that the primordial was tricking them regarding Silverlake. Who's the next most likely to take a secret deal?

  I assume that the other Timeloopers are being informed off screen? 

  Man, Zorian not evacuating his family because he doesn't want to deal with the awkwardness makes me think that his mindset has really been warped by years of death being no big deal. You don't get second chances anymore Zorian.

  Kinda disappointed that everything conspired to slow things down and stop them from doing anything for a few days. Also not sure how Zach got injured... he's a terrifying opponent, and doesn't have any real startup time. If Zorian woke him up before he was literally stabbed or whatever I feel like he should be able to beat or at least easily escape anyone short of QI.

  edit: If silverlake is out, I wonder if she's just cracking the prison right now. Maybe she's good enough she doesn't have to wait.

  It's imperative for Zorian and Zach to go down their to do list by importance; hence priority list. On the other hand, Silverlake (or RR) does not have to. If she goes down her list in the same manner, it would make her action predictable. Plus, it might involve her competing with the duo to complete her task. To hurt the duo most, Silverlake must predict their list and go bottom up. I skip few steps to explain this, but in conclusion, she can ambush both Alanic and Xvim with little chance of contest. I fear for their lives.
  ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    I'm not convinced that Silverlake is going to be a villain here. She's often done (or proposed) morally questionable actions with not entirely unreasonable motivations.

    She may have reasoned as follows: Panaxeth is in a position to keep working on making this offer until someone breaks and accepts it. Depending on who does so, it could be one of a dozen flavours of disaster - even *if* Silverlake manages to get out of the loop without Panaxeth's help, she then has to deal with a hostile former comrade (and all of them will stick to the deal once they make it). But if *she* is the one who accepts the deal - then Panaxeth will stop working on getting the others to accept it. At the very least, Zach will escape, and presumably save the city - while she has a month to figure out a way around the Death Curse (such as by swapping bodies with someone a good deal younger and letting that other person deal with the Death Curse).
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      Yes, that's very likely to happen. It fits with Silverlake line of thinking of robbing a profit or avoiding loss. But along that line, she will be the supposed hostile former comrade. Time loop escapees will be out to hurt her, regardless her success in releasing primordial. It's a great danger I'm not convinced she will ignore.  

      She may rely on her usual trick of retreating into pocket dimension whenever hostile mage out to find her, but it's unlikely she will think it's still suffice.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        Yeah, and that's *another* reason for her to get her soul into someone *else's* body as fast as possible. Then the time loop escapees will be looking for her old body, not the new one she stole.

        In fact, killing her Death-cursed body (and the poor unfortunate soul she shoved into it) and arranging matters in such a way that the corpse is easily found by the other time loop escapees is probably the easiest way to get them off her back...
        ```

    - u/hallo_friendos:
      ```
      If it had been anyone except Silverlake, I'd be inclined to think they accepted just to have one more month to live, with the intention of dying at the end to keep Panaxeth contained. But Silverlake is selfish enough and morally lacking enough that I don't think she'd be willing to make that kind of self-sacrifice.
      ```

      - u/CCC_037:
        ```
        I agree that Silverlake wouldn't plan for her own death. But I don't believe she'd work for Panaxeth's release, either - she wouldn't want to introduce into the world a variable she can't control which could crush her like a bug.

        She's got a month to figure out how to break or avoid the Death Curse, and she'd happily inflict it on someone else to avoid being subjected to it herself. I don't think she'll be dying at the end of the month, and I don't think she'll be releasing the Primordial, either.
        ```

        - u/hallo_friendos:
          ```
          That's true, if she thinks she can get out of the death curse without releasing Panaxath she'll probably do that. I personally think a being the gods had trouble dealing with would be able to make it so a mere human (almost said mere mortal there, whoops) wouldn't be able to break it in a month, but maybe not. But if she thinks the angels will only send Pan straight back into prison afterwards like QI does, and she couldn't figure out how to get the curse off, she'd probably release him rather than die.
          ```

          - u/CCC_037:
            ```
            The Death Curse is specifically mentioned as being attached to the new body that Panaxeth creates, *not* the soul. So if she, an experienced soul mage, can get her soul into a new body, she should be fine.

            Her younger self has a body that's a near-perfect fit to her soul. Which implies that she's either already done as Zorian did and evicted her younger self's soul (and merely acted like she didn't know what was going on when they came knocking), or she has a different plan in mind.
            ```

            - u/hallo_friendos:
              ```
              Hmm. What you say sounds true, but if it is, then Panaxeth made a suspiciously big mistake in releasing her. Maybe he just wanted ZZ to have to be defensive (checking up on Alanic, and stuff) at the beginning of the loop so they wouldn't get around to other things as quickly? Maybe he noticed that Silverlake's teaching was pretty important to the group (they did have to get QI to replace her, iirc), and figured she wouldn't do as much harm outside of the loop as in it? Or maybe he just really didn't take a close enough look to see she was a capable soul mage beforehand, after all, he did make that second offer to Zorian claiming he hadn't noticed he was that good a mind mage. I suppose he might even have deceived them about releasing her at all, if there were any way he could get rid of her soul (maybe put in the real world after his best effort to sabotage it, or somehow abuse whatever mechanism the time loop has of destroying souls). Sometimes I wonder if Silverlake was just a complete distraction, and he actually just modified Ilsa's marker so it wouldn't run out and she could escape in a future loop, or something. (If we're assuming that's how RR happened, then he's capable of that.) Too many possibilities. (edit: forgot one more: Panaxeth thinks she'll release him despite not being forced to because of the interest she's been taking in his pocket dimension.)

              As for Silverlake, I think Zorian really did meet old Silverlake, but new Silverlake had already snuck into the pocket dimension or something and was just waiting for that meeting to occur before taking over. There's some risk from her perspective that Zorian would kill her old self, but she does think of him as squeamish. Of course, that's all just guessing.

                This is my theory. Panaxeth doesn't care about humans - humans are mere insects in comparison to him. So he doesn't care enough to bother to take too close a look.

                Kyron explicitly asked what stops people from taking his deal and then working against him, and was promptly and quite abruptly exiled from the conversation - presumably because he doesn't want to give his deal to anyone who thinks of that. Silverlake no doubt *did* think of that - but was presumably sneaky enough not to ask Panaxeth directly.

                > As for Silverlake, I think Zorian really did meet old Silverlake, but new Silverlake had already snuck into the pocket dimension or something and was just waiting for that meeting to occur before taking over.

      There's a stark difference between facing an opponent on the field of battle and assassinating him on his sleep. Ambush is always the first option for non battle mage like Silverlake or Zorian.  

      Benefit her? That's debatable indeed. That's why I open the sentence with 'to hurt the duo.' She might not need to hurt the duo at all. But if I were Silverlake, I'm in favor of hurting them; as putting disadvantage on your opponent is equal to put advantage on yourself.  

      You can't assume others failed. You hope for the best, but prepare for the worst. I imagine just like Silverlake when Panaxeth talked to her; you hope your ritual spell to escape the loop is successful, but if it's not, better take the deal.

      - u/GoXDS:
        ```
        I forget if it was a comment here or if it was in the chapter itself but Silverlake's capabilities *are* still limited by her not being able to use simulacrums so it's debatable if she has the time to be doing something with questionable returns and chances of success. also, she probably only suspects Zach coming out. otherwise, there was much less reason for her to take Pax's offer 

        ofc it's best to take Alanic in his sleep but it's questionable how easily she can do it, too. he'd still have wards and is not necessarily capable enough with wards to beat them with little time and resources (won't have most of her assets without raiding her original's home). meanwhile, the assassins in the loop presumably had time, resources, experts, and manpower
        ```

    - u/abnotwhmoanny:
      ```
      Well, she would probably expect at least Zach to get out. Even if she doesn't think the others will make it.  


      I still don't think Silverlake specifically will go after anyone though. She's not ancient because she's brave or strong, but because she's cautious and shrewd. She also can't use Simulacrum to attack with. Exposing herself to danger is not what Silverlake does.

          This is actually my pet theory--Silverlake met up with her previous self and successfully convinced her to cooperate before Zorian showed. Then, original!SL (or a simulacra, if making friends with her alternate self finally teaches her the right mindset for it lololol) pretends to not know anything when talking to Zorian as a test to see if Zorian would try to kill/attack her to see if his "nice guy" act was all for show in the end. I expect both Silverlakes to secretly spend the whole month getting the death seal off Pana!SL and show up either at the climax or an especially opportune moment to fuck over RR while smugly rubbing it in ZZ's faces that they actually thought she would help the primordial.

  getting his family to safety doesn't necessarily imply teleportation. They could just walk to the nearest hotel or something so they would be harder to find

  this has been bothering me for a while, but how does one even enter the Gate normally? Presumably you have to physically go to the gate so shouldn't Zach's body be down in the research facility.

    Simulacrum 1 was maintaining the mana reserves while laying in bed.  Simulacrum 2 was on 'guard the house' duty, and was the one who woke up Kirielle.

    I agree that letting his family go on like normal is stupid.  Zorian could easily mind-control his family into going into hiding (or just going to visit Damien early).

    My impression was that a god or angel marked a human soul to be a looper in the real world, then hit the on button so the gate started.  The gate takes a snapshot of everything, recreates that snapshot in its dimension, and then any marked soul is treated as the controller.

      Zorian thinks he killed his own soul or let it pass naturally into the underworld, but then remember that insane dude who's collecting souls for his own purposes way back when they were still deciphering the invasion? if a normal dude can do that, who's to say Old Zorian's soul hasn't been plucked away by the primordial - heck, maybe even Silverlake herself as the proxy - did some actual time travel shit to him, sent him back to when the loop first started and gave him a purpose? Time doesn't mean the same to a primordial after all.

      Maybe that's why the primordial said that Zack is fated to be his enemy. Zack will try to kill RR, and then when Zorian realizes that it's his own self he can't bear to kill him a second time.

        Zorian wouldn’t even hesistate killing himself a second time. He just murdered a truly innocent version of himself amd RR soulkilled his big friendly spiders. He’d think RR is an irrational evil version of himself and help Zach end him.

    No, RR can't be Zorian. Because he has repeatedly failed to attack Zorian or his family, indicating that he doesn't know who Zorian is. If RR were old Zorian, then you'd expect him to at least check on the Kazinski family.

    Also, the way markers work, you don't get two of the same person at the same time. When recreating the world, the Gate either reuses the marked copy, or creates a fresh copy, not both.
    ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  I think dismissing his old soul was a mistake. An understandable one, but a mistake.

  Zorian is pragmatic - more so after the loop, but even before that. I'm pretty sure that the original would be able to mentally and emotionally adapt to being around his post-loop self, because *this is his own potential*. This is what he himself can become, given a few years of intense training. And post-loop Zorian is in a perfect position to provide that training. He spent about 8 subjective years in the loop, right? Maybe 10; with all the Black Room usage it's hard to be sure. I wouldn't be at all surprised if he can pass on most of what he learned in five or less.

  Making a body for his old soul should really not be all that hard, either. The author has confirmed that with soul sight, it's possible to cast the simulacrum spell on someone else's behalf, and he has plenty of experience making golem bodies. Might need to tinker a little, but he's tackled much harder problems before.

  And the benefits? Well, they still have the same mana signature, as evidenced by Xvim testing it to confirm his identity. They would be able to share mana really easily. And with his hive mind techniques, they should be able to cooperate really well, even though they wouldn't share a soul. Basically, Team Zorian would end up twice as big as it is now.

  But it's a moot point :(
  ```

  - u/GoXDS:
    ```
    one, you can't be sure how much influence Zach's soul fragment affected Zorian

    two, loop Zorian was self motivated and his previous issues became irrelevant and minor compared to the constant shock he had to experience

    three, what exactly is original Zorian supposed to do after that, socially...? disappear from his family and friends and acquaintances and government? for how many years of training before becoming independent and working elsewhere?

    four, live life as basically a non-human or effectively a lich not of his own volition while everything is stolen from him?

    five, would Zorian really need another Zorian 5 years down the line? how much \*actual\* benefit is this, post-month?

    six, accept someone that claims to be you and \*stole\* everything from you and you had no say in and forced to do things against your will for years to live a life you did not choose?
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      One: Zorian still had the same mana signature, so any change from Zach likely wouldn't have a big impact on their ability to share mana.

      Two: Original Zorian would certainly have had enough of a shock, I would think, to get him out of his comfort zone. Being self motivated is fine.

      Three: Zorian was fine with the idea of leaving his family and going independent. He wouldn't miss anyone but Kirielle, and if he knew that loop!Zorian was taking good care of her, I expect he'd be fine on that front too.

      Four: Living as a golem probably wouldn't be too terrible. They're strong, durable, and by now I gather they can be pretty lifelike. Since the alternative is for him to die - if not at the start of the month, then at the end of it - I don't see this as "stealing everything" but rather helping him to retain something. And it's not as though loop!Zorian has nothing to compensate him with.

      Five: Loop!Zorian has pretty much hit the limits of his mana reserve growth. Original!Zorian isn't nearly there yet, but once he's grown, that basically doubles their pool, which means twice as many simulacra. That's pretty valuable.

      Six: Given good enough evidence and good enough reasons, I think I'd accept those things instead of a quick death.

      For that matter, it might even have been possible, in the longer term (post primordial), for loop!Zorian to move out into a golem and put original!Zorian back in his body. Alanic could probably have found a way.

        to clarify then

        one: this is in reference to Zorian having the emotional capacity to accept and adapt, mostly

        two: original Zorian's not going to be driven by self motivation. it'd be "forced" upon him by loop Zorian. or what, is loop Zorian going to offer then what happens to original Zorian if he rejects? if he accepts, it'll be begrudgingly and will impact his learning capabilities. loop Zorian also had time and room to calm himself and analyze the situation. original won't have room to do his own thing to distract and calm himself and would be very limited in what he can do to do so, too. loop Zorian was in a state of denial and went for normalcy for a while while original does not have that option

        three: there's still a difference between distancing yourself and having yourself completely replaced. there's also a huge difference in finality, where one he can technically go back whenever and the other, he'll be forever an outcast. there's still Taiven for friends, and he can't verify his identity in anyway without piggybacking off of loop Zorian so government and getting certification is going to be very difficult (or he'll be forever chained, legally, to loop Zorian and thus he's basically enslaved). plus the fact ofc that one is of his own free will vs not

        four: the point is he's not \*human\* anymore. and there'll be many things he cannot do anymore, many of which can affect him very deeply, like sleep, food.

        five: but why does Zorian need that many simulacrum after this month?

        six: Zorian is 100% not going to be rational about this. and imo you're vastly underplaying the emotional aspects of this
        ```

    I agree. From an amoral perspective he missed out on a chance to use a perfectly matched soul to either increase his Mana reserves or anchor an ability to himself.

    The golem option is another more ethically acceptable choice.

    Also given his mind magic capabilities perhaps he could share his memories with the original? Theoretically a download of all the memories should make them the same person. If it worked we have no competition for the body. What would happen then?
    ```

    - u/GoXDS:
      ```
      but does he even need that after this? and he's definitely not capable of doing that during the month as I highly doubt he's that skilled in soul magic

      why wouldn't there be competition over the body? in normal life, it's 100% the inferior option and leads a very different feeling of life (sleep and food at the very least). it'll also be time and effort before they can make a golem body that's not too awkward to move in (and reduce this gap of inferiority)

      there's also a difference (potentially) of memory downloaded as packets vs memories you experienced. there is a distinct difference between knowledge memory and experience memory irl. maybe memory packet download would still make it experience memory, with it being able to attach emotions and all but that's just an if. but even then, \*time\* is a factor in shaping a person and I'd imagine original Zorian with same memories would still not be quite the same. not to mention original Zorian wouldn't be able to process the memory packets 100% efficiently until after some mind training
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        I never said he should teach via memory packets; I meant more that he should be able to pass things on much more quickly than he learned them, simply because he's already been through the learning process and has all the information gathered in one place. And I was definitely talking about a longer term approach.

        Pretty sure the golem bodies are already well designed for long term use. He's had a simulacrum researching that full time for quite a while, ever since he invented the technique. And by now the hive mind has a lot of experience of living in them. Note that an ordinary simulacrum still sleeps, so there's a good chance that golacrums do too.

        The biological body has advantages for dating and future family, obviously, but those might well be distant enough for him to allow his old soul to have the body back on moral grounds.
        ```

        - u/GoXDS:
          ```
          this was in response to SearchAtlantis's statement about experiences making them the same person. not with regards to teaching. skill at magic can't be taught via memory anyways since that's soul related

          right. though they didn't go in-depth into how far they got that so leave the question of discomfort out. do you remember where they mentioned simulacrum being able to sleep?

          there's still just basic need of eating. while a burden of life, it's still very much a part of living and makes a difference in how it is experienced and lived.

          &#x200B;

          also in regards to your response directly to SearchAtlantis: they meant the opportunity to use original Zorian as a mana battery was a choice that loop Zorian missed out on and is the amoral action. meanwhile, presenting original Zorian choice of death or golem life is also a false choice forced upon him and thus also potentially amoral, or at least a gray area and hence they said "more ethically acceptable". but that's a whole big philosophical debate (in similar vein to euthanasia)
          ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Giving his old soul the option of a body, instead of immediate death, is surely not all that amoral?

      The utilitarian ends-justifying-means action was possessing his old body in the first place.

  how is Zorian going to continue guarding his family?

  if he takes Kiri on the train, is he just going to leave his mom with a guard that is incapable of guarding? Won't his mom notice an extra Zorian in the house? What about the middle brother?

    His parents should be on a boat to Koth quite soon.

    And I suspect that he won't lift a finger to help Fortov. AFAIK he still doesn't know where Fortov goes during the invasion, because he doesn't care.

  I don't get what's up with the votes. MoL is good but not 200++ good when PGtE is 50ish good. Is it just because PGtE updates more frequently and there's a scarcity effect?

    Because we're getting into the final arc of this novel. We've been building up to *this* moment since the start of the novel, quite literally.

      Although every moment hasn't been accounted for, pretty sure that's a nope.

      Zach, on the other hand, seems to have used the loop to try to snag himself any girl he could.

    Disagree. 4 times the popularity is well deserved here. Zorian Kazinski is more appealing than Cat Foundling. Her struggle is often bloody, depending on might more often than wit. Maybe because the problem over there is never simple enough for us to tinker and approach. Especially when seen through the Cat's eye.

    I'm not saying PtGE is worse than MoL. But for me who is more attracted to engineering way of problem solving -- that is finding ingenious way to avoid the problem altogether due to deeper understanding, do better whenever we have chance to iterate, or take away wastefulness when trying to achieve goals -- MoL stands supreme. If Amadeus is the main character over there, with his brand of appropriate application of force, I might not be able to take break from reading it.
    ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Here's a single data point: I've tried pgte and... eh. It's better written from a technical standpoint because (I presume) the author is a native English speaker, but I think Zorian > Catherine.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Do you think the title puts people off?

    I haven't read PGtE myself. The protagonist being Evil is a minus for me, even knowing that you do not think it means what I think it means, and the reviews I've seen of it have been mixed enough that I haven't tackled such a long work.
    ```

    - u/sambelulek:
      ```
      You should. Evil equal Pragmatism there. Dependency on luck or divine intervention among the evils are frowned upon, because that's the central theme between the God Above and the God Below. God Above intervene, God Below disdained it.
      ```
