## Mother of Learning after the loop

### Post:

So, I've been rereading MoL in light of recent developments at the end of second and start of the third arc. I'll probably put together some lengthier post later, but something just fell into my eyes.

>[No. First of all, they intended to summon a large amount of high-level demons to help with the invasion. This was why they were willing to go through with the attack, despite their lack of success against us and their inability to do much to the academy and its wards. Demons, especially high-level ones, are virtually immune to mental attacks and highly resistant to magic. The aranea would be massacred in no time at all, and the mages would be too busy fighting for their lives to help out the city's mundane defenders. Those same defenders would be up against trolls and fire elementals, who are immune to firearms, with winter wolves and iron beaks acting as support. ]

>"Thatâ€¦ that's horrible," Zorian said after digesting that for a second. "Why aren't they doing that now?"

>[They can't, remember? No summoning anything while in the time loop. The whole material plane has been cut off from the spiritual ones,] the matriarch reminded him.

So basically, Zorian and Zach both had problems dealing with the invasion before, none succeeding in stopping it, and as it seems, the final invasion, when the simulation ends, will be far more difficult to deal with.

  Quatch-Ichl was mostly carrying the invasion before. With the aid of their three soul magic specialists they can probably stop him. The rest of the damage can be sharply limited.

    Agreed.  If Zach and Zorian find a way to kill Quatch Ichl as soon as the loop starts they might have a chance.  And they need to find a way to get to him anyway in order to get his items for their upcoming quest, I'm guessing.

      You'd need to find his Phylactery. But, regardless, you don't need to kill a lich in that situation. Just destroy his body so that the soul returns to the Phylactery. It will take a few months before the Lich is a problem again, and by that time the invasion issue will have been solved.
      ```

        Unless he has a collection of bodies ready to change into within a day. In which case you've got an angry (and apparently well prepared / somewhat paranoid) millennium old lich after you. And he is loved by the citizens of his country of course. So no using the masses against bad evil wizard.
        ```

        - u/elevul:
          ```
          If you kill him the day of the invasion, even if he can have a body ready within a day, he'll still get back to Cyoria way too late to do anything about it. Yes, it could be annoying to deal with again, but once the army is taken care of, the (remaining) combined might of the city should be more than enough to crush him if he tries to do anything too public.

  ```
  Also depending on when things are summoned the universe will quickly butterfly away so none of that living a perfect month in the real world.
  ```

  - u/rabotat:
    ```
    It will butterfly anyway, because of the aranea and mercenaries that were ejected, not to mention the Red Robe. And yeah, also the demons and gods.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Of course that is true too, just summons are likely to have a global repercussions within the first month. So if they find some nifty trick on another continent I imagine people summon things everywhere, unless it's like a dark art.
      ```
