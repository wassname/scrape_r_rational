## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Finally got around to binging Waves Arisen after someone brought it up here; hadn't yet, in spite of its status as foundational ratfic, just because I don't know Naruto at all. That wasn't a problem. I'd recommend it to people here.

  Also, it's much shorter than I'd have thought; just 23 chapters or so. I think I did it in a week.

  Some people here might find [Captain Disillusion](https://www.youtube.com/@CaptainDisillusion/videos) of interest. His videos have limited direct epistemic value if you're not falling for internet hoaxes all the time, but I've found them to have an entertaining "detective" vibe. To summarize his content, he analyzes fake viral videos in excessive detail and shows the various clues which indicate how the video was faked, and who did it for what purpose.

    +1 for Captain D. Even before I started watching "Visual FX Artists Reacts" from Corridor Crew and the Captain D channel, I was fairly sensitive to sub-par compositing and other things like that. They have made me appreciate the details of good and bad visual FX in general.

  Read "A Hero's War" by jseah: https://m.fictionpress.com/s/3238329/1/A-Hero-s-War. I don't really know what to think of it, and feel like I've missed some important background in understanding it. The story feels like it went through a rewrite at some point, because I swear I've read a lot of it before... But it could also be the curse of uplift stories, where a lot start to sound the same after a while. Someone in a recommendation thread a few weeks ago mentioned it, hence why it caught my eye. Some random thoughts...

  Story summary: the hero - a regular jack-of-all-trades high schooler - gets summoned to a fantasy world, and tasked with finding a legendary sword and ending the generations-long war against zombies threatening to overrun the kingdom. But he's not the protagonist of the story. Rather it's a materials engineer student who also gets summoned, unbeknownst to anyone, and who sets out to uplift society so that an industrialized nation can fend off the undead and improve the lives of the living. The story jumps between the two, but focuses on Cato, the uplifter, and his efforts at modernizing a post-apocalyptic medieval fantasy world.

  The good: lots of uplift stuff, in many different areas of technology (medical, magical, agricultural, industrial, transportation, etc). And some good exploration of topics I don't usually see in these kinds of stories (the effect on politics, the blowback from those left behind by progress, discussion of why putting our current society's morals onto feudal societies may lead to, ahem, friction). Good mystery throughout about figuring out why there are zombie attacks and what happened to the former superpowers of the world.

  Bad: well, it seems unfinished. No updates since 2021, and apparently even then the last few chapters came after a long hiatus as well. So unfortunately it could quite possibly never be done. Which leaves the center mysteries untouched. The uplifting technology discussions are detailed, but overly so at times, causing frequent info dump chapters and long paragraphs that I mostly just skimmed. The time period of the story is murky for a lot of it, but time  DOES pass, I think about 2 and a half years since the characters showed up in the new world. 

  The biggest issue is that it feels like two different stories smushed together, without either being fully fleshed out. Morey, the Hero, has his own side chapters but really feels sort of underdeveloped. It's like the author knew his story, but only showed parts and expected everyone to have read his notes to understand. Meanwhile Cato's stuff is where the bulk of the effort clearly went, but Cato himself is kind of an underdeveloped character. We get at least some ideas of Morey's inner thought process, but little of Cato. His interactions are interesting, but again, it doesn't develop him much as a character. There's little psychological exploration, which is weird considering he seems to be emotionally numb, doesn't bond well with others,  and is potentially asexual. 

  Additionally, it feels like most of the characters (especially side characters) talk with the same voice. I can tell you the main characters, but it took like 100 chapters before I could differentiate between all of Morey's companions, and I still was never quite sure who the random soldiers/knights/commanders were. Doesn't help that the author would have some chapters with a new character show up just to be killed off shortly after, while in others a new character becomes a recurring theme. And I am pretty sure there were two characters named Omal (one was an alchemist, the other a slave who was being beaten). Not sure why that stuck out to me, but it threw me off a bit.

  Overall, would I suggest it? Ehhh... Only if you really like technology uplift fantasy stories. Having no conclusion really kills the investment of time for me. The writing is only ok, but the dice into different technologies and the substitution for magical components was decent.

  Any one have any extra information about the story? Was I right that it got rewritten or was two different stories smushed together?

  I'm looking for something where a rational mc has to operate under heavy scrutiny and limited movements or actions. Examples: The promised Neverland( first arc), Cordyceps, death note.

  - u/lucidobservor:
    ```
    [Fox's Tongue and Kirin's Bone](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/42226/foxs-tongue-and-kirins-bone) qualifies for about half of that (the heavy scrutiny). Protag's actions don't feel super limited since he's _very_ sneaky. Would highly recommend the story in general though.

    [The Goblin Emperor](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17910048-the-goblin-emperor) if you like court intrigue and don't mind *often* flipping to the appendix to look up people/definitions. Not an unqualified recommendation, go for it only if the genre/synopsis particularly appeals to you.

      For more court politics, try https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50194/surviving-the-succession-a-transmigration-fantasy, it’s a beautiful folk Chinese setting with really great endnotes so if you don’t understand the historical Chinese references you can learn as your read. Great stuff.

    The manga [*Parasyte*](https://www.anime-planet.com/manga/parasyte) might fit? It's a psychological horror/action story in which the protagonist tries to protect himself and his loved ones while also hiding his condition both from other humans and the alien parasites that have infiltrated humanity. The protagonist starts out as a normal teenager, but I think he counts as rational because he makes intelligent choices and he grows a lot as a person over the course of the story. The manga delves into the internal lives of the characters, contrasting the humans to the inhuman mentality of the parasites and giving all of them believable motives.

      Thanks, I saw the anime. Do you know if the manga is slightly different.

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        I've never watched the anime, but I've seen a lot of discussion online. Judging by that, the main differences are:

        * The anime has a different art style meant to appeal to modern audiences.

        * The manga was set in the late 80s, whereas the anime shifted the time period to be in the 2000s. This has an obvious effect on the clothing/hairstyle of the characters and the level of technology in the setting.

        * The manga might have more explicit gore.
        * The anime mostly stuck to the original plot of the manga but added a few scenes, omitted a few scenes, and placed scenes in different order.

        * The early personality of the main character is different in the anime. The anime version is more of a YA stereotype of nerdy insecurity, whereas the manga version of him is more mature and self-confident.

    Surviving the Succession on RR might fit:  
    [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50194/surviving-the-succession-a-transmigration-fantasy](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/50194/surviving-the-succession-a-transmigration-fantasy)  


    From the blurb on RR:  


    Formerly titled Transmigrating Into the Main Character's Political Rival  
  
    Kayla is a burned-out college graduate who's neck-deep in student debt, stuck in a minimum-wage job, and about to be evicted from her apartment. One morning, she abruptly wakes up in the body of a short-lived villain from a web novel set in Ancient China. Now, Kayla has to deal with living in the body of a man while trying to survive as the doomed political rival of the Seventh Prince. She'd rather roll over and play dead than take on a fight, but fate and the Imperial family seem to have different plans for her. Caught in a web of political intrigue and backstabbing amidst a succession struggle between the Imperial Princes, it will take Kayla every ounce of wit she has to stay alive.  
  
    A political fantasy set in Ancient Chinese with elements of magic, transmigration, and time travel. This story will be updated every five days for the time being, we will return to the 4 day update schedule as soon as possible.  
  
    \-------  


    The "constraints" placed upon the MC here are both political and social, and the author deftly explores what imperial intrigue in ancient china is like, with explanatory cultural notes at the end of every chapter detailing certain chinese metaphors or concepts such as legalism vs confucionism or fillial piety.  


    The first book  has recently completed (around 100 chapters or so), so now is a good time to jump into the fic

  I have recently read [The Pride Before](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/the-pride-before-pokemon-xianxia.111674/#post-26274506) which is a Pokémon/Xianxia cross, and while it’s good it’s pretty short. 

  I was wondering if anyone know of stories that have a similar dynamic of a older battle crazy mentor teaching a young student. I especially liked the battle in the Rising gym and how the author showed us both what the old mentor (Red) thought and the pupil (Gold) thought both during and after the battle. It was also nice to see a high level battle early in the story, because those are surprisingly rare in xianxia. 


  Also if there’s anything Pokémon that y’all would recommend I’d appreciate that too.

    Adored this story! Not explicitly rational but as far as fluff goes I thought [Peaks and Valleys](https://archiveofourown.org/works/8791510/chapters/20154553) was worth reading. It’s basically mute-savant-Red from Blue’s POV.

    Found it.   
    Imagine if tomorrow, the price of water dectupled. Suddenly people have to choose between drinking and washing dishes. Activists argue that taking a shower is a basic human right, and grumpy talk show hosts point out that in their day, parents taught their children not to waste water. A coalition promotes laws ensuring government-subsidized free water for poor families; a Fox News investigative report shows that some people receiving water on the government dime are taking long luxurious showers. Everyone gets really angry and there’s lots of talk about basic compassion and personal responsibility and whatever but all of this is secondary to why does water costs ten times what it used to?

    **[A Song of Peace: Imperial Regent Quest](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/a-song-of-peace-imperial-regent-quest-40k.88949/)** is a good one. It's a quest with the premise that you are the firstborn child of the God Emperor from way back in the 21st Century, recently rediscovered, and placed as Lord Commander of the entire Imperium so that you may right the ship. Set at the Fall of Cadia. The nice part about it is that the voters looked at each other during chargen, nodded, and created a Madoka expy named Pandora to be the compassionate beacon of hope. And then the author nodded back, and set her backstory to be basically the Madoka Magical show adjusted and recontextualized to fit 40k lore. She has spent the last 38 millennia as a minor warp goddess resisting Chaos, and has now been re-embodied. It's quite good, we have just entered our fourth decade-long turn.

  I really like Larry Nivens "Madness has its place" as a rational! story, also its worldbuilding is pretty interesting.  https://www.baen.com/Chapters/0671878794/0671878794___3.htm  

  Earth is a pacifist utopia*, with a military police regime suppressing dangerous tech. Cue some disturbing reports from the space frontier - but what can individuals do about an existential threat? Well, buckling down and doing whatever is necessary works sometimes! Possibility space is larger than one'd think. 

  Standard Niven disclaimer applies: "stuck in the 1950s" aka outdated perspective on woman, society etc.

    [A Farmer's Tale](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-farmers-tale-asoiaf.608353/) is pretty self-indulgent.

    While the writing is not that good, particularly the dialogue, I liked the verisimilitude of the uplift, the author is clearly knowledgeable about farming and the communities at ah and sb helped a lot with key technologies and realistic implementations. They even created some great supplemental content based on the world, stuff like a fantastic geological map and 3d model of several cities.
