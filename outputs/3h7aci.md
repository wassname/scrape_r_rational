  How is this even a reasonable ignorance of technology. If assault rifles exist and airplanes exist then the technology gap is absurd to have not been noticed. Also to think that a capitalist republic that got to where it's at by exploiting material resources not trading or invading new lands is absurd(google countries not invaded by Britain). Both sides are developed militarily. They show no signs of pacifism that would lead them away from conquest. The elemental nations should have been conquered a 100 years ago.

    My take is that the 'Citizen's Free Republic' (its full name) is something like Meji Japan -- highly xenophobic and isolationist.  They've been involved in a war with a nearby country for a long time, mostly because of the other country's aggression.  Between those two things neither country spent much time exploring.

      I'm having trouble suspending my disbelief that in your world you have supersonic strategic bombers, but no enterprising explorer has thought to exploit the natives of the elemental nations for their natural resources. Maybe it could be explained away by saying chakra somehow affects their actions to make them more isolationist?

      Though, there's not a lot you can do when thrown into a world where the setting doesn't make sense in the first place.

        My assumption at this point is that the Republic literally doesn't know about the EN, that their discovery is very recent -- just in the last few years.

        > Though, there's not a lot you can do when thrown into a world where the setting doesn't make sense in the first place.

        True, that.  And, of course, there's the whole thing about "if the Republic has satellites, why haven't the EN turned up on them?"

        The best thing I've come up with so far is "because the Sage set up a muggle-repelling field over the EN".  It's feasible, since this is the guy who [literally created the moon](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Moon) so he certainly had the power levels.  I'm not thrilled with it, but this setting is so completely whack that I'm having to buy a lot of plot-hole-filler.  The cloak, of course, would be breaking down because it's been a thousand years and it's running out of energy.

        I'm still looking for a better answer, but that's the best I've got so far -- the Republic is highly isolationist so they didn't do much boots-on-the-ground or long-range-aerial exploration, there's a lot of naval navigational hazards between here and there to keep ships away, and the magic chakra cloak kept eyes in the sky from spotting the EN.

        It would have been simpler had I put the Republic's tech level earlier as I had originally intended, but then I wouldn't be doing the setting that Kishimoto created, which is what I'm trying to rationalize.  As you can see, it's non-trivial.

  I guess you're keeping things around the Wave Arc power levels for this? Speeds ranged from 80~m/s for the Genin up to about 120~ m/s for someone like Zabuza swinging his sword.

  By contrast, Gaara's sand shuriken are mach 14~ and things only scale massively up from there are the series progresses (4-5 digit mach at the end)

  It's worth noting that Zabuza (and thus scalable to Jounin if sticking to wave arc power levels) displayed durability enough to be completely bullet proof. Ballparking somewhere between a building to a city block level explosive to outright kill them without looking up specific feats. Again, this goes through massive powerscaling as the series progresses (multi-city block for Gambunta and high+ tiers in the chuunin exams, up to moon level for God Tiers like Naruto and Kaguya at the end).

    Where did those numbers come from?  Are they movement speeds or attack speeds?  80 m/s is 163 mph, which is kinda crazy.

    I wasn't aware of that info, so I spitballed some movement speeds -- I'd have to check my notes for exactly what they were, but you can figure it out from the speed at which they covered ground when they first left Konoha.  

    > 4-5 digit mach at the end

    Wow. That's orders of magnitude more than orbital velocity. 

    EDIT:

    > It's worth noting that Zabuza (and thus scalable to Jounin if sticking to wave arc power levels) displayed durability enough to be completely bullet proof.

    When I was watching the anime I only managed to sit through part of the Wave Arc...I think I bailed out somewhere during the bridge fight, although I don't remember exactly.  I'd be curious to know what happened that showed such durability, but I'm still going with the ruling that most ninja are glass cannons.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:

      > 4-5 digit mach at the end

      Seriously? I mean, we know shinobi are fast, but those are speeds approaching 0.01c easy. There's the teleportation time/space jutsu used, which we can assume bypasses the normal laws of physics. But if ninja are really moving that fast, shouldn't they be being continuously set on fire by the friction they generate? And inflicting massive damage where they move, not just where they take off from?

      Also, where are these numbers coming?
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        > Also, where are these numbers coming?

        My guess would be it's one of [the databooks](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Reference_Material).
        ```

    - u/LeonCross:
      ```
      Calcs. I'd have to dig through them, but Zabuzas durability probably comes from not dying from the water dragon.

      While one can debate specific numbers and such, the displayed feats consistently scale up and up and up as the series progresses, so at best you can say they're between point a and b where that point is rediculous ly high by the end. The Sage made the moon to hold the juubi body for example. In the last movie, naruto basically blows the moon up. Etc.

      Reading character debates and calculations for such things is one of my hobbies.

      In the end, they're really not glass canons. Wave arc shows Jounin with sufficent durability to ignore conventional firearms. Gambunta and a weakened shuukaku in the exams demand a decent level of ordinance. At some point anything that can be scaled to some level of naruto tailed beast mode can shrug off nukes casually.

      It's a shounin. That's how these things tend to work. Bleach was stuck at mach 20something for a few years which made it hilariously slow compared to the others.

      That said, do what works best for your fic. Even if Zabuzas levels of Shinobi  and up can tank or even dodge bullets demanding military levels of pay grade to deal with them, how many Zabuza level Shinobi  are there at the end of the day? Not many I'd imagine.

      So the Republic is still terrifying because they could murder all but something like 1% of the elemental countries. At which point it becomes mutually assured destruction. They could nuke the ninja to basically non-existence, but the few that are capable of surviving are beyond their ability to put down.

    It's a major plot point. 

    This was actually supposed to be primarily a romance story about a developing relationship and the coming of age of the people involved. Then Orochimaru came on stage, laughed in my face, and told me what was *really* going to happen. Still, the romance will still be there, it will just be set against a rather different backdrop.

    [](#s "It's possible that the Republic can't reverse-engineer chakra, but they are able to use raw materials infused with chakra. If Orochimaru can consider kidnapping a valuable ninja for her bloodline, I bet the brass in the Republic have considered kidnapping high-chakra civilians to either introduce chakra to their population or just to start a breeding program for their own mana batteries.")

    [](#s "They could probably even entice civilian battery-chargers to defect with the promise of all the benefits of mechanismics. Culture shock would be an issue with the 'ask nicely' approach, but you wouldn't need many to start leveraging that technology.")

    [On the other hand](#s "If Naruto ever gets his hands on a nuke he can clone enough of himself to destroy the Republic wholesale. At least the fissile material would disappear when the clones died, I suppose. Still, they could always just leave before detonation.")

    [](#s "Hell, almost any military mechanismics in the hands of Naruto would be an existential threat. Imagine if he had a sniper rifle. He would win any battle of attrition by default, and could use jutsu to disguise the location of Prime!Naruto to prevent a loss by overwhelming force. The Republic couldn't stop him - sure you can shoot the clones, but they can still use chakra to be preternaturally skilled at aiming and dodging. It'd be like fighting an unending horde of commandos.")

      > possible that the Republic can use chakra-imbued stuff

      Yep.  The Elemental Nations are already trading seals to them in exchange for mechanismic gear.

      "[](#s "Naruto could clone-copy a nuke")"

      Yes, although not easily.  I had to do some world-building as to what stuff he could clone and, among other restrictions, he's got to be physically carrying it when he clones himself. (i.e., it can't be beside him or in a sealing scroll)  That puts a weight limit on what he can produce.

      There is the [](#s "Davy Crocket mini-nuke (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Crockett_%28nuclear_device%29") but I haven't decided if I'm going to let it exist in my world.  It's such a ridiculous game-changer if it does.

      EDIT:  I should add that, so far, the Republic is pretty much ignorant of the existence of the Elemental Nations.  They're still very isolationist and only slowly opening up.  A very few adventurous entrepreneurs have gone exploring and are conducting trade with the EN, but it's all being smuggled and treated as a very closely-guarded trade secret, as they don't want to lose their monopoly.
