  Great story â€“ a real classic of science fiction! Thanks for sharing, OP! Really makes you wonder how we'll beat that second law of thermodynamics ... But we'll have to deal with death and aging, first. And what is that but biological entropy? Immortality will be a small victory for the human race against the universe, and I hope it won't be the last.

  (Come on guys, let's at least *try* to stay on topic)

  I honestly don't see what people like so much about this story. It's just the same thing repeating 5-6 times then deus ex machina.

  To be clear, I'm not being mean. I thought it was decent, I just don't see the big deal.

    When I read it, I do indeed see Deus ex machina, just like you.

    However, I see that it is a story about the potential evolution of technology.  Humanity created the Multivac, and then, Multivac improved itself while serving mankind.

    It goes beyond that though.  In terms of storytelling, I'm trying to remember if I've ever read a work where the entire purpose is to introduce a carefully crafted, meaningful, deus ex machina.

    Did I manage to say all that without spoilering too badly?
