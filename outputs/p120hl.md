## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Anything like Robin Hobb's Farseer or Worth the Candle but with a happier protagonist? I absolutely love long stories with a lot of introspection that explore one character deeply, but it feels like all the ones I can find are about depressed people getting depressed. :/ 

  Examples include:

  * Worth the Candle

  * Robin Hobb's Fitz books

  * A Daring Synthesis by Ironypus has moments of this in the early and mid chapters, but the ending was pretty abrupt

    [*Luminosity*](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/luminosity-fanfiction) is excellent for this, though the deep exploration of a single character mostly happens in the first half.

  Are there any rational works that deal with transitioning to a post-scarcity society?

  It doesn't have to be a strict modern day setting. It could be anything from a DnD wizard finding out how to item duplicate on a massive scale or Taylor triggering with a tinker power that makes Aeon paragons or a post-scarcity alien species attempting to uplift another species. 

  I'm mainly interested in seeing a rational portrayal of the economic/political/societal/etc. upheaval that comes as a result of suddenly finding a practical way to go post-scarcity, and how the characters would deal with this.

    From your Worm example I'm going to assume you've seen [Playing with Lego's](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/playing-with-legos-worm-supcom.377328/) [sic], a questionably written but complete fic where Taylor gets the Seraphim blueprint library downloaded to her shard. Later parts of the story do feature the scaling of this tech to benefit the populations of Brockton and Earth in general. I wish [A Cloudy Path](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-cloudy-path-worm-supreme-commander.301286/) had taken its Aeon tech in this direction, but alas.

    [Significant Digits](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html)) is HPMOR fanfic that addresses the challenges of scaling the Philosopher's Stone to an entire planet. I thought it was pretty good but opinions are contentious.
    ```

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    [*To the Stars*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984) spends a lot of time in settings (2400's Earth, and to a lesser extent colonies) where most scarcity that individuals could encounter is by choice.

    It's also a fantastic magical-girl-military-scifi-doorstopper; I think the best parts on the transition you're interested in are sprinkled through the worldbuilding and perspectives of older (as in, centuries-old) characters.  Well worth reading, and then /r/ToTheStars has good discussion... and spoilers.

    You might enjoy [Hail Hydra?](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hail-hydra-mcu-villain-si-complete.851572/reader/), a Marvel isekai story that was recently completed on Spacebattles.

    A guy with deep knowledge of canon gets isekai'd into the pre-Avengers movieverse with the stats of his choosing (maxed intelligence and charisma, everything combat related as a dump stat). He enacts plans to improve earth's future (which obviously includes preempting Thanos). The post-scarcity part comes in when his efforts to improve technology make energy production and higher educational attainment essentially free. This has a massively disruptive impact on the world economy. It's not all sunshine and roses.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      How good is it? Do I need a lot of knowledge of marvel to enjoy this fic?
      ```

      - u/chiruochiba:
        ```
        I consider it a good fic - I enjoyed it a lot. That said, the protagonist eventually falls off the slippery slope of morality, so the story probably wouldn't appeal to people who dislike reading a villain pov.

        The story mostly follows the events of the Marvel movieverse (Avengers, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Ant Man, etc.) with a few other Marvel storylines tied in. When I read it I only had passing familiarity with the plots of most of the movies, so I think the fic stands well on its own.
        ```

  - u/fljared:
    ```
    I recommended it upthread, but [Silmaril](https://www.glowfic.com/boards/18) has a variety of parts along these lines. A good amount of the after-antagonist story of each world, and the larger story as each world is contacted by the wider interdimensional civilization, is setting up those societies, and what uplift culturally and scientifically looks like.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      To clarify, I am looking for post-scarcity uplift specifically, not regular uplifts. 

      For comparison, regular uplifts usually greatly decrease the price of food, but also give farmers harvesters, fertilizers, pesticides, etc. so they produce much more food and so it balances out. Post-scarcity just pulls out limitless amounts of food from nowhere while not boosting farming productivity in any way, so the farmers don't profit at all. 

      I want to read about the chaos that results when tons of people find out that their resource production/manufacturing jobs are suddenly unnecessary and unprofitable, and how a society/protagonist might carefully introduce post-scarcity in small steps to reduce said chaos to manageable levels.
      ```

    Galactic Economics was the last decent one that I saw, recommended by Yudkowsky two weeks ago, featuring financially illiterate aliens being introduced to the concept of human economics. 

    Personally, I see it as a story of how Earth became the Coruscant of the universe, and it could plausibly fit into ancient Star Wars history.
    ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      Does it ever return to its roots, so to speak? Without diving into the politics of it, I felt that >!having the CIA start revolutions in closed economics!< was both too on the nose and frankly just less enjoyable than the early, purer-economics chapters.
      ```

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
        ```
        Agree. I decided to give it a go because of where the recommendation came from but "an entire multi species alien civilization with FTL and other similarly advanced tech never came up with the idea of currency" was a little too much. In the early parts where it was really just a sci Fi vehicle for exploring economics concepts, it worked well enough but as it got further astray, I didn't think it could really bear the weight of the initial conceit anymore.
        ```

- u/Tibn:
  ```
  I’d be interested in any story centered on fights between individuals where the characters win by strategizing around their consistent capabilities with realistic externalities as opposed to something like Fate or basically every superhero property where winning is usually decided by the ridiculous amount of variance every character has in the magnitude of their capabilities. 

  I’d also be interested in any story where the full extent of the powers that are granted by a wish are actually used instead of being wasted.

    The Manga Ultimate Rock Paper Scissors is, in my opinion, the pinnacle of the power battler genre, as I like to call it. 

    Death Battle in 5 seconds is also great, and manages to bring in interesting perspectives on bluffing and combat resolution when neither of you *really* wants to hurt the other.

    Much of [Luminosity](https://luminous.elce
    nia.com/) deals with strategizing and theorizing about others' power sets.

    It's related-work-but-not-quite-a-sequel [Silmaril](https://www.glowfic.com/boards/18) has many of the elements I think you're looking for, in terms of "how do these powers/magics interact", although its less about combat and more about finding new exploits.

    Hunter x Hunter ? If you want anime combat. It's basically the best shonen anime / manga can get. The author loves hiatus though, every time a new dragon quest game comes out he gets mysteriously sick and has to take a break, which can last anything from 6 months to years.

    &#x200B;

    Apocalypse generic system, maybe qualifies ? It's a litrpg, but the magic system is interesting and based on what the user wants it to be, once it's chosen it can't be changed and they have to use it optimally and creatively to win.

  A very esoteric for this sub request. Looking for dungeon core stories with good/great prose that feature the PoV of the core exclusively or at least extensively.

  The prose should flow well and have little to no errors or typos. Basically, as good of an editing as one can find within the genre.

  The plot, characters, etc. can all be terrible. The protagonist can be worse than an irrational bag of bricks. The story can be abandoned after just two chapters—that also doesn't matter. I only care for the prose and for the narrative to be very heavily focused on the process of dungeon-coring.

  (I'm training a NovelAI module, if you couldn't tell.)

  Many thanks in advance!

      Popping in a Senator's secretly Kryptonian clerk who puts out fires before [Crassus' fire brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus#Rise_to_power_and_wealth) could arrive and demand payment would be a great way to start the Man of Steel's crusade for Truth, Justice, and the Republican Way. Crassus could become his Lex Luthor, using his slave trafficking connections to make a large workforce search for and find the green rocks which turn Superman into *Vir Cero*, the Man of Wax.

- u/EliezerYudkowsky:
  ```
  The most Yudkowskian xianxia there has ever been - and you can already tell this just by the title, really - is [Oh My God! Earthlings Are Insane!](https://www.webnovel.com/book/oh-my-god!-earthlings-are-insane!_17778080505851905)  It's by the author of Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, but unlike 40MoC starts off strong right away instead of being ordinary xianxia for 100 chapters first.

  In chapter 315, somebody talks about how they're concerned about the combination of biochemical beasts and artificial rune intelligences increasing inequality between superhumans and ordinary people, 100 years in the future.  And the main character thinks about how that's a very optimistic take, actually, and would be a nice problem to have, because he expects civilization to be destroyed before they get there.  That's how Yudkowskian this story is.
  ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    There's a pattern to thexe xianxia stories of characters having about 0 theory of mind when the author wants them to antagonise someone, and being master communicators (or manipulators) at other times. Really off-putting to see that any character interaction is going to be either MC holding an idiot ball so that plot can show him off later, or MC achieving all of his goals and the other party barely existing.

    Based primarily on that this is a -rec from me by chapter 85; the main character has no consistent personality, all of his problems so far are solved by remembering a thing from the future and becoming stronger. YMMV

      I'm going to offer a strong counter-rec for Embers - while it is well written, the main premise really turned me off.

      I think that what I liked the most was a more accurate depiction of cultures than the one in the show, general character interaction, and the interaction between spirits and humans. the story is fairly controversial because we see it mostly from Zuko's pov and while fairly charismatic, he like all the other characters in the story is an extremely unreliable narrator. u/sephirothrr >!And given that he is the fire nation's prince he is inclined to believe the fire nation did nothing wrong or that all their wrongdoings aren't their fault which is plainly wrong.!< >!I believe that in the end, the point of the story is that everybody fucked up and continued to fuck up for something like a millennium.!<
      ```

      - u/sephirothrr:
        ```
        well, the issue with that is >!other characters in the narrative supporting zuko - like there's the scene early where like, aang tries to escape after he surrenders to zuko, and even toph(?) agrees that like "well now he's obligated to murder people, them's the rules"!<
        ```

        - u/incamaDaddy:
          ```
          and right there is where >!spirit-enforced, rules-as-written,!< wildly different cultural values start having unfortunate implications.

          edit: also what toph agrees with is that she understand that from the pov of someone from the fire nation that would be a reasonable response, not that she agrees with actually doing it. and anyone could have told them that.

            right, which I didn't particularly care for or find interesting. generally, I'm not a fan of plot devices/changes which exist purely to remove character agency, and I'd expect that most people on this sub wouldn't be either

    [40 Milleniums of Cultivation](https://boxnovel.com/novel/forty-millenniums-of-cultivation/)Probably the best of this list, I'm a huge fan of this one and it's been reccomended a few times on the subreddit. Massive fusion between 40K and Xanxia, so it's possibly not the best pick if you're looking for something that matches the setting precisely, but it's more than good enough to make up for it imo. Has some of the best political analysis in web fiction, enough that I'm stoked whenever it comes up even though I don't actually agree with the author politically. The explanation is complicated but the first 100 chapters are basicallya  different story, if you have some tolerance for bad writing in order to get to good stuff you can give it a go but i uusally reccomend people start at ch100 or so.

  I almost always root for the antagonists in a story, no matter what. I have no idea why that is (I considered the possibility that I really like fictional villains in general, but then I read a few stories with villain protagonists and immediately started rooting for the heroic antagonists, so that can't be it). It does make reading a lot of books much more suspenseful, antagonists are usually light on the plot armor and can die or experience major setbacks at any moment. It makes them more frustrating also, since I hate seeing them lose and let me tell you, antagonists unsurprisingly lose a lot!

    Do you know what you enjoy more specifically than that? Do you just enjoy the stakes better when you focus on non-protagonist characters? Because I feel like any suitably grim story setting with several perspectives being swapped between will be able to deliver that same feeling.

    Do Battle Royale-esque stories work? Dangan Ronpa isn't rational, but it's adjacent to that genre since its about a group of students trapped in a school, and the only way to get out is to murder someone else and cover up that you did it, so (blank slate for pseudo self-insert) protagonist aside you don't know who's going to survive.

    (Also you'll get more responses if you post it in the first day or two of a weekly thread going up, so if you can work out more specifically what you're looking for, you'll get more and better responses in next Monday's thread by posting then)

    It sounds like you might be looking for stories where the antagonists win a lot, and the story occasionally switches to their perspective so you can enjoy it, without actually focusing on them narratively?

    You might like Worm on the off chance you haven't read it already.  If that guess is accurate, I'd recommend other grimdark stuff for the same reason.

    You might also like a story where the protagonist is embedded with the antagonists, like the first bit of https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32067/never-die-twice .

  Anybody know any western novels with the same feel/vibe as overlord? The mc relies on his loyal subordinates, the world building is great, and the mc is morally grey to evil.
  ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    [Only Villains Do That](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40182/only-villains-do-that) slowly shapes to be something like this, though currently it's too early to say. The worldbuilding is fairly deep and interesting, the subordinates are fleshed out and relied upon, the MC is a lighter shade of gray but obviously not a hero nonetheless. Also has the same "the MC is very strong but not absurdly OP" vibe, at least to me.

    I liked it a lot more that Overlord, FWIW.

          Strong disagree. Author considers pacing to be subpar as well, but I loved it. It's no Delve—every chapter furthers plot, worldbuilding, and/or character interactions. Out of fifty chapters there are, I'd say there are five at most that could've been written out without impacting the story. Everything is very fun to read—the style engages reader even through a filler. 

          The pacing is slow, but it's exactly my kind of slow, and I'm sure many here would agree.

      Anti-recommendation for abysmal pacing and the main character for not really being smart. Also the main character is basically a hero relative to everyone else and his party a bit flat for me. 

      The MC is also weak (not sure where "very strong" comes from), accomplishes little (partly due to the poor pacing), and has none of the Overlord power fantasy if that's what you're looking for.
      ```

      - u/NTaya:
        ```
        The rest is subjective and I'm not going to argue (though I disagree), but MC has OP abilities for the place he's found himself in. Being triple-blessed is a Big Deal as the last chapters showed, and the MC consistently and satisfyingly beats down mooks. He's definitely not weak.

        It's absolutely not a power fantasy, though, but I'm fairly sure the OP hasn't asked for a power fantasy.

          Part of the charm of Overlord is that Ainz & co are so strong as to be basically an outside context problem to the natives. 

          Meanwhile in OVDT, the protagonist spends the first 40 chapters hiding in a keep engaging in turf wars with a petty crime lord. He almost got killed by bandits and accomplishes very little that doesn't feel like that product of luck. Arguably those are circumstances being manufactured by his patron deity, but the point is that he earned very little of his success.

          I would say that the two have little similarity in vibe except nominally having a villain hero.

              I would not be disagreeing with you if the MC was actually morally grey at all.

              The most "morally grey" thing the MC has done was a completely bloodless and clean heist on a caravan, and even that could be justified out of necessity.

                  Immolate (which is basically the cruciatus curse) is the most effective ability he has. It's a powerful unblockable non-lethal attack, and far better morally than actually killing or crippling someone with a sword or arrow, which is what would happen in normal combat. It's not like he has a stunning spell or something that can achieve the same effect without the pain. He's also never used it to torture and mainly use it in combat circumstances. 

                  Also the threat of the goddess absolves much of the moral responsibility he could have. Considering that he'd just die otherwise and the goddess just find someone else that's probably worse to take over his role, what can he do about it? Moreover it's implicit that a lot of the situations he finds himself in is due to the goddess manipulating things behind the scenes (e.g. him getting Immolate in the first place). 

                  Imagine if Talyor of *Worm* had only joined the Undersiders under of duress (say, some villain threatening to kill her and her father). It's hard to ascribe much (if any) moral responsibility to her joining the Undersiders' crimes if she's minimizing casualties as much as possible while searching for a way to defy said villain, and also spending her spare time setting up soup kitchens. That's basically the MC of OVDT.

                    He literally used it to torture that noble. And on many occasions he needlessly used it on people just to punctuate his statements. You're probably forgetting it because they're all nameless thugs that were needlessly tortured. If you don't know their name they basically don't exist, right? 

                    Even if Taylor had joined under duress then later *murdered a toddler* (people always forget she did that), the duress wouldn't negate the infanticide.

                      Having someone holding a gun to your head and threatening to kill you and a baby unless you kill said baby is obviously going to make you less culpable (or even completely blameless under some moral systems) for infanticide.

                      Also only if you hold no distinction between corporal punishment and torture. He's an asshole, the people he immolate are assholes and deserve  retribution anyway, and it's better than the death or maiming (not like jail time or reform was even an option).

                      She did that as the leader of a Protectorate strike team with the explicit goal of stopping the apocalypse. And as if that wasn't justification enough, the toddler was at high risk of being tortured eternally by Gray Boy.

                      I mean, if you wanted a justification for killing a toddler, you would be hard-pressed to dream up a better one. There's no way that would be ruled a murder.

    It's not Western, awkwardly translated, has a rocky start, and is Grimdark turned up to 11, but [Ouroboros Record, Circus of Oubeniel](https://www.novelupdates.com/series/ouroboros-record-circus-of-oubeniel/) has similarities to the broadest strokes of Overlord so it might be up your alley. Tl;dr: dude gets Isekai'd but is so utterly traumatised from the memories of the process of reincarnation that he resolves to focus solely on research into immortality from as soon as he is able to do more than crawl and babble. He is explictly the bad guy, and the experiments he does would fit right at home with WW2 Nazi scientists, with the mediocre translation of an amateur webnovel being the way that you don't get sickened by the events. He eschews personal power for having reliable subordinates (mild mind control via brain surgery will do that to someone), since its simply the best path forward, rather than the protagonist getting caught up in not having a very large sword to swing. Even if there's plenty to question about the quality of the work, if nothing else, it's striding off in a direction you don't really see without featuring the edgiest of protagonists, as you have a main character with a firm one-track mind and little sympathy nor sadism in him, his only goal is living forever.

  I've got an oddly specific request that I'm not sure I've nailed down what it is I like exactly, or how to describe it, but how about works that are in the horror genre  but are focused on the scenario itself over the drama/tension/jumpscares/inscrutability/etc.

  Like I can't think of much that's super rational that I've read like that's like that. I enjoyed reading the (aborted after 2 and a half arcs) Worm/Warhammer 40K fic Acolyte for the interfacing with the Chaos Gods, the other Warhammer 40K fic Hope and Silence in the Hive does this type of thing well too. The BNHA fic Daymare had an absolutely brilliant way of describing all the horror aspects of the protagonist's quirk (but is firmly not rational and otherwise mediocre as a fic, it's basically canon plot BNHA except swapping superstrength for mixing Venom from Spiderman with Cthulu as a superpower instead). I didn't get into Pact (Wildbow) or Katelepsis, which may have just been because it was too uncertain about what the horror actually was, and too driven by tension, but maybe I just didn't read it at the right time or push deep enough into the story. I also enjoyed the first Dead Space as "fps but nightmare fuel setting" (and jumpscare tension stuff gets lessened a bunch when you expect it and can shoot it), but didn't enjoy trying the first Amnesia game because it's about running and hiding and not looking at the spooky stuff or you take mental damage. The Doris Finch and Captain Blue-in-the-bottle parts of Worth the Candle were also interesting to me as an exploration of a horrific setting too, and the torture memory scene in Scott Westerfeld's The Risen Empire stuck with me for years after. 

  This isn't exactly rational, but dealing with an idea rather than the moment to moment feelings of a scenario is rational-adjacent enough, and people in this subreddit have pretty good recommendations in general anyway. If anything, I guess I'm describing something more akin to morbid curiosity than conventional horror really, but seeing scenarios explored honestly and fully is a common trend in rational-adjacent fiction too, and the same aspects emphasised here is what I'm looking for with horror works.

    There's [Cordyceps](https://archiveofourown.org/works/6178036/chapters/14154868) which is about dealing with mysterious memory shenanigans.

    I usually recommend [An Imago of Rust and Crimson](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10820443/1/An-Imago-of-Rust-and-Crimson) with Katalepsis. It's a worm fic that makes the setting even more unsettling and gives Taylor a pretty creepy powerset. Still recommending because I think Katalepsis does tragedy and Imago does horror better.

    Edit: Forgot to describe Imago

    It's a long shot, but you might like The Northern Caves: https://archiveofourown.org/works/3659997/chapters/8088522 .  I'd say 80% chance you don't like it, 20% chance it's great and an experience you couldn't find anywhere else.

    I haven't read it, but a friend of mine recommends Sailor Nothing pretty strongly: http://stefangagne.com/sailornothing/ .  I can't say for sure if it meets your criteria, but I think it might.

    If Pact seemed promising but turned you off, you might try Twig.  It's a little bit less handwavy with the powers and still has a strong existential horror vibe.

    Friendship Is Optimal is a fairly low-tension exploration of a horrifying concept.

    Blindsight has some tension-based horror and quite a lot of mystery/inscrutability based horror, but ends with conceptual horror and is really strong on it.

    There Is No Antimemetics Division has quite a lot of conceptual horror.

    The Erogamer has rather a lot of high concept horror in it, but it's also at least 50% smut, so if that's not at least a little appealing you'll have a bad time with it.

  I want to reccomend the movie [Oxygen](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6341832/) as the most rational-adjacent movie (that I've seen) from 2021. I won't spoil it but it basically starts off as sci-fi FLEEP and explores concepts relevant here pretty well.

  Comment for those who have seen it: 

  >!I like that they've even considered smaller details like how cloning doesn't give you memories and there's separate tech for it, and the way all the devices used have a place for them. I only have minor gripes such as the injection machine when there's already IV and the system not redirecting stuff like oxygen automatically from defunct pods. Still, very well done.!<

  If you like it, you might consider Buried and Phone Booth as decent 'stuck in small place' movies to watch after or something like Cube if you lower your standards a bit further. At least, those are some of the movies I watched in the few days after it.

  Also minor shout-out to Hitchcock's The Birds for having a protagonist who takes courses in General Semantics - a precursor to rationality and rational fiction via The World of Null-A.
