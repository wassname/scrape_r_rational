## [Biweekly Challenge] Dungeons & Dragons

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3v8b1j/biweekly_challenge_deal_with_the_devil/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Deal with the Devil". /u/kishoto is the winner with their story ["A Cursed Blade"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3v8b1j/biweekly_challenge_deal_with_the_devil/cxnt9hz), and will receive a month of reddit gold along with super special winner flair. Congratulations /u/kishoto!

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be "Dungeons &amp; Dragons". Give us a rational story set in the world implied by D&amp;D rules, a munchkin romp through rules-as-written, or the sort of insanity that comes from someone playing the game in a logical way. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, December 30th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Paperclipper". A paperclip maximizer is a hypothetical superintelligent AI which has maximizing the number of paperclips in the universe as its utility function. More generally, it refers to any superintelligent AI that's doing things contrary to human values even if it's been built without malice or incompetence (though sometimes the concept stretches further than that). Don't be afraid to get creative with the idea.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 12/30.** Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

  If you are familiar with DnD 3.5, you can probably read most of that just fine. I do however think that a bit of an OOC explanation after reading makes sense, so I'm including that in a reply to this comment.

    [What's going on:](#s "There are many instances where the rules of D&D just don't work and house rules are mandatory, like how you can't just buy ladders, divide them up into poles and sell them to buy more ladders. I don't find those kinds of rules exploits very interesting. But, ignoring *that kind* of broken stuff, there remain some very, very interesting rules and combinations that call out for attention. In particular, the "Mothercyst" feat from Libris Mortis is probably my favourite set of mechanics in all of D&D. It's a feat that gives a practical, comprehensive tool box for *taking over and ruling the world*. Now, almost inescapably, the spells it gives you are saddled with the "Casting this is always always always evil" tag, and the intent by the creators was probably for only insane necromancers to use it. But if you are not insane, you can do things with it that are only technically evil and actually very useful. What the feat gives you is one spell for putting an icky but harmless undead cyst of flesh inside someone. You can then use that cyst to target the 'victim' with everything from scrying to standard d6 damage to making them your mind slave to targeting them with a non-mind affecting Suggestion to making them explode in a shower of undead cancer to eating their soul. Oh and if they die they become an evil undead abomination. So if you are not evil, what this means is that you can scry on your allies, communicate over a distance, and if absolutely necessary make them suicide bomb whoever is nearby with undead cancer. You can also turn any creature ever into a mind slave, from dragons to demons to flies to PCs, with the only limitation being spells per day. Anyway, that's why I love the feat. It's horrendously abusable, flavourful, and if you give the villain a few years' head start there is no reason why every single person in their kingdom should not be an unwitting spy. In my submission, I've simply allowed a flawed rationalist good guy to discover the feat. Since the D&D gods kinda suck in what they do with their power, he decides to try to become a god by getting more and more people to worship him while doing no harm to anyone [except violating 'Free Will', cough cough]. Mechanically, he's an Ur-priest, because he wants to become a god but has no respect for the current gods. As both the class and the feat and all the spells he relies on are [Always Evil], and as DnD like Dresden Files employs mandatory alignment shifts for overusing aligned spells and such, I wrote it as him deciding to plan on becoming evil, and forcing himself to abide by flowcharts he wrote while still Good/Neutral. As hinted at, his flowcharts were written before he realized that he could use the evil spells on bugs and animals, so he discovered the loophole of mass producing undead for an army without [yet] hurting anyone with sentience. He's also a level 1 Binder so he can recover Con damage fast enough to feed one undead per minute without hurting anyone. Ie, by the time he's created around 3600 intelligent evil undead monsters, he's either ascended or he's going to be able to rationalize it as 'needing' to deviate from the flowchart to keep his army in check. At which point we've got a villain with an undead army and a civilian population that knows nothing yet can be used as spies and suicide bombers.")

      ~~I'm on Chrome, the spoiler text cuts out after "taking over and ruling the world".~~  
      Never mind, I'm an idiot.

        I'm on Chrome as well and it works fine. If you have RES you can view source to read it or disable the subreddit stylesheet.

        If you don't have RES you can right-click on the spoiler and press "Inspect" then read the HTML. The spoiler is the title attribute of the `<a href="#s" title="..."></a>` tag.
        ```

        - u/abcd_z:
          ```
          Oh, goddammit.  It doesn't work for me because I disabled all subreddit stylesheets by default then forgot about it.  With stylesheets disabled you have to hover over the spoiler text to read it, and there's a limit on how many characters that will display.

    [I like it.](#s " It's sort of Cabin in the Woods for DnD. Interesting that the module is about a character that wrote themselves out of the module. Or can they modify the module descriptions, so the character was originally intended to be a 'boss', and only later wrote themselves out of it?")

      [Thanks for the comment! If you've been following my progress in these challenges, by now, you'll know I love responding to them So...](#s "The bar tender is known as the Man of the Rings. He was never intended to be the final boss of the module, even he would be unable to change that if he was, the Narrative's hold would be too strong. Rather, he was intended to be a secret, hidden boss. The kind you find by doing a bunch of convoluted sidequests that have no real apparent goal. The thing is, the designers made finding him too difficult of a challenge, so he's not found very often. So he spends most of his time in the D&D world as an average bar keep. As a result, he's grown disdainful of his intended role in the story, because of what the Narrative does to the people around him, who he views as friends and neighbors. People's livelihoods are disrupted by the Party callously, and it sickens him. Technically, the steps he takes to avoid the Narrative are, themselves, machinations of the Narrative. He's just lucky that the designers made finding him so difficult. And he knows this as well, which doesn't make him very happy. ")

  [The Last Spell of Mirabilis:](http://medicsandmagics.blogspot.com/2015/12/interlude-last-spell-of-mirabilis.html) 2347 words --> 7165 words*

  Story takes place roughly 1500 years after traditional D&D, but it operates under the 5e system if it were realistically constrained. (It is also set 15 years after my entry on "the Matrix". Even though I haven't published any of my web serial yet, the events of this short story take place during the second arc. I was just too excited to let yet another weekly challenge pass me by!)

  *edit: I've been sick for the past week and I'm Christmas vacation with my family. After some of the initial feedback, I realized that my 'short story' is lacking an ending, so consider the story only about 2/3rds complete at this point.
  **edit 2: a few introductory components to the characters were added and I wrote a real ending

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    This feels less like a story and more like a worldbuilding infodump. It also doesn't end in a satisfying place. The runes are also bothersome -- they are clearly important, but I can't read them. I have a feeling that this is just a special font and that if I wanted to go out on the net (or do some basic cryptography) and search I could figure out what it says. That's too much to ask for a short story though.
