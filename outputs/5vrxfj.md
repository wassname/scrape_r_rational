  Only, err, about two years late. Sorry.
  ```

  - u/GrecklePrime:
    ```
    Better late than never! Very satisfying ending to a story I all but gave up on seeing finished.
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    No worries :). I hadn't seen this before, so for me it all happened together.

    I trust that after their holiday, they'll get down to the business of fixing problems like slavery on a larger scale?
    ```

    - u/DRMacIver:
      ```
      I think it will be less a holiday and more exploring the world fixing what they find that needs to be fixed, though their do-gooding will probably remain erratic for a while.

      (But I'll leave that for somebody else to write. I've enough on my plate with [Programmer at Large](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9233966))

        Plenty of Culture novels to adapt. Especially once Jasmine starts letting omniscience go to her head.

        Also, speaking of Programmer at Large, you can't leave us with a cliff-hanger like _"OK. Have you heard about gender?"_ Unless you're secretly Greg Egan or something.
        ```

          Actually I'm bored of the story and was thinking of waiting another two or three years before continuing.

          Err. Wait. No. The other thing. [New chapter out today](http://www.drmaciver.com/2017/02/programmer-at-large-how-did-people/) but I forgot about the new "Only post your stuff once a week" rule, so somebody else will have to post it for me (hint hint).

          (The schedule is every other Friday. I found doing weekly a bit too much, and intended to use biweekly to build up a buffer, but I must admit so far that hasn't happened).

          > Unless you're secretly Greg Egan or something.

          Not as far as I know. It would be a bit confusing if I turned out to be wrong about that.
          ```

            That actually sounds like something from an early Egan short story. Would work as a side-arc in Permutation City.

          Ooh, *Inversions* is pretty obvious, and some of the others would be fascinating.  Just... not *Surface Detail* please.
          ```

          - u/HeckDang:
            ```
            I've read those two but I still don't know what is meant by "adapting" them. What are you guys talking about?
            ```

            - u/PeridexisErrant:
              ```
              Introducing storylines or situations from the novel(s) into *The Rules of Wishing*, and seeing what the characters make of it.

              So eg. *Inversions* might become a story about Jasmine and Aladdin subtly influencing the Wars of the Roses...

    You're alive! woohoo!
    ```

  - u/Bartimeaus:
    ```
    Thank you! I've been re reading every six months or so, just enjoying the story. Thank you for finishing
    ```

- u/Gurkenglas:
  ```
  What was Alladin's plan, here? Wait for Jafar to scry and teleport and then have Genie conjure an ininsubstantial anvil at the first opportunity?
  ```

  - u/Ulmaxes:
    ```
    Pretty much. He knew Jafar would pursue them, and be supremely confident in his ability to overcome Al/Jasmine because of the genie limitations. And _obviously_ the genie would be bound by all the rules too, so the second he shows up, he binds the kids and poof, insta-win. Jafar's only weakness would be his assumption about the genie. The fact that not only had they freed him, but done so quickly, would not occur to Jafar- and rightly so; neither kid had given him the impression they'd do so ever, let alone so quickly.
    ```

    - u/DRMacIver:
      ```
      Yes, exactly.
      ```

      - u/LeifCarrotson:
        ```
        Was Jafar bind to the genie's lack of bracers? Attention to detail would be an important trait for an ancient sorcerer, and he did pick up on the genie's attitude change.. But didn't notice the loss of the jewelry that signified binding, which was practically the only thing the genie wore?
        ```

        - u/DRMacIver:
          ```
          I assumed that still-pretty-phenomenal semi-cosmic powers were enough to fake the details of looking like a bound genie and didn't bother elaborating on that in detail.
          ```

      - u/HeckDang:
        ```
        Why did the genie bother pretending to go through the motions with the third wish? Was that necessary for some part of the plan?
        ```

        - u/DRMacIver:
          ```
          Because Jaffar might have sensed that the genie was doing magic and panicked. This masked the attack as complying with the wish.
          ```

  - u/failed_novelty:
    ```
    Yup. Freed Genie is roughly as good at magic (innately) as Jasmine and Alladin, with millennia more experience.

    The anvil was just to amuse himself. Jaffar was dead the moment he picked up the lamp.
    ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  BTW, it's spelled "Jafar" in the movie.
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    Yeah, they're both valid transliterations of the Arabic name, but I picked the wrong one early on and only realised when I came to write this chapter. I decided not to bother correcting it.
    ```

- u/SeekingImmortality:
  ```
  Great to see this finished!
  ```

- u/Towerowl:
  ```
  Nice, i can finaly share this with my sibling who insists on only reading finished work...
  Thank you for taking the time to finish it.
  ```

- u/SaintPeter74:
  ```
  That was great fun, thanks!
  ```

- u/Ulmaxes:
  ```
  Solid ending to a fantastic story. Far and away the best take on this setting ever. Great job!
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    I quite like [Twisted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-77cUxba-aA) as another take on this setting. It would probably have influenced this story more but I watched it in the years between between chapters 4 and 5 and I didn't feel like retconning Jaffar that much.
    ```

    - u/Ulmaxes:
      ```
      At work, so I only watched the first few minutes, but this immediately strikes me as hilarious. Definitely watching the rest this weekend. 
      EDIT: "Keep it. And may rats ejaculate on it and everything you own." Oh God my sides
      ```

- u/HeckDang:
  ```
  >Even elementary tasks like constructing a seal **of of** Solomon are an unbelievable amount of work.

  typo
  ```

- u/Noir_Bass:
  ```
  Haha, gotta love the subtle reveal that the whole setting is in some sort of post-apocalyptic world. Now I'm guessing the whole genies and over-genies thing is just Sufficiently Advanced Technology.  Thanks for taking the time to finish this!
