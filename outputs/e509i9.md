## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I greatly enjoyed [Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma: An Integrative Approach](https://archiveofourown.org/works/20177950/chapters/47807593), which was [recommended last week](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/e1h8gc/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/f8p9tp4/) by /u/Juansson. It's Good Omens fanfiction that follows Crowley's therapist as he works to recover from the traumatic events of the book/show.

  What are other (good) works of fiction, nonfiction, or even fanfiction that focus on recovery after trauma?

    I can recommend [Two steps forward, one step back](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/two-steps-forward-one-step-back-worm-au.568306/) (Worm fanfic), or, if you're in the mood for something more... abstract, the game [Gris](https://store.steampowered.com/app/683320/GRIS/).

    Neither of those have the psychological aspect, though. Maybe [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/about/)? A good part of the story follows a group therapy team.
    ```

  - u/Green0Photon:
    ```
    [Hear the Silence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896) is one of my most favorite fanfics ever. It's a precanon Naruto SI that focuses on how even though the SI is something of a prodigy, the entire world is still incredibly traumatic to her and every ninja, and the fic does a great job of dealing with trauma. She's strong, but she's far from overpowered like most SIs, and power balance is done very well. The majority of the characters are original, being precanon, and the author does a lovely job of making me care for them.

    I read *tons* of SIs, and this might be my favorite one. I highly recommend it. It's the only Hurt/Recovery fic I've ever read that's been done well, or at least, I've not read any that are nearly this good.

    I love this fic.

    On fanfiction, there's **[For The Sake Of Better Things](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11507550/chapters/25821414)**, a Naruto fanfic focused on recovery from trauma. One part physical trauma (protagonist), one part psychological trauma (Hinata). Takes a while to spool up the story.

  Finally sucked it up and made an account after lurking here for two years.

  1. I miss Game by God. Has anybody read anything like it, not counting the other incomplete story the author did? (Does anyone know how the author of that is doing, also? I know they said they were going through addiction stuff.)

  2. Are there any good scary rational stories?
  ```

- u/TheAnt88:
  ```
  Are there any rational deals with the devil plots or stories? I just listened to the short but excellent "The Details" podcast where the Devil tries to make a deal with an intelligent and logical man so he can do a job for him. The man acts like a normal person would, asking important questions, clarifying things like language, and the price is not for his soul. With a very interesting twist ending that makes me sad, there is no sequel to it. 

  I'm really interested in seeing if there are other such stories where the characters are intelligent enough to look for half-truths, clarify things, and make sure they don't make a stupid deal.
  ```

  - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
    ```
    There was a short story posted a while ago where a guy tries to make a deal with a devil (really, he's making a whole series of deals) in a society where such things are routine and systematized but he is breaking the rules. Can't remember the title, but it has an interesting take on the whole thing. Hopefully someone else will remember the title and post it.

      - u/DangerouslyUnstable:

        /u/TheAnt88 ^ This is it. If you want rational "deal with devils" story, hard to get better than this one.

          - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
            ```
            The character has clear goals and acts consistently with those goals, and any mistakes he makes are reasonable mistakes s person might make and not carrying the idiot ball for the sake of the plot. Is he scared? Yes, but that's a normal human response in that situation.

            I would also argue that he really didn't panic at all. As for "better ways", I think he did pretty ok. He tried a bunch of things and got confirmation (such that it was) before he took the step of selling his soul. 

            But remember, rational fiction is not the same as rationalist fiction, and while this *might* be borderline on the second (I personally would count it), it's DEFINITELY the first.
            ```

    [A Girl Corrupted by the Internet is the Summoned Hero?!](http://yudkowsky.net/other/fiction/girl-intercorrupted/) (warning: link has first four chapters free, full story costs 99 cents) by Eliezer Yudkowsky isn't *exclusively focused* on dealing with the devil, but doing so comprises one of several major plot threads, and is executed in a very interesting way. There's some interesting supporting worldbuilding around demonic social structures and around the methods people developed to get maximally-good deals with summoned demons, and those bits of worldbuilding collide with the rest of the plot in a beautiful, if hard-to-summarize-without-spoilers, fashion.

    (As an aside, while I have the impression my stance is somewhat unpopular, as far as I'm concerned Girl Corrupted is straight-up EY's best story. It manages to do some *really impressive* weaving of plot threads in such a way as to have the eventual resolution be on the one hand a Dramatic Surprise but on the other hand easy to recognize in retrospect as the inevitable well-foreshadowed outcome of everything that came before, with a degree of neat everything-sliding-into-place-ness that overshadows that in any of his other stories. Plus highly-entertaining prose on a moment-to-moment level.)

      I feel like you could be talking here about a lot of Yud works, like Trust in God or Sword of Good. I get the feeling he often writes backwards from the ending to achieve that effect specifically.
      ```

      - u/LunarTulip:
        ```
        I haven't yet read Trust in God (I'm waiting until I get around to consuming the source material first), but I don't think Sword of Good really does the thing? It has plenty of foreshadowing, but it doesn't have the same sense of *inevitability* to it that Girl Corrupted's ending has.

        Some comparisons (spoilers for Sword of Good and Girl Corrupted): >!The Lord of Dark being Good is information new to the readers at the time of its revelation, whereas the Wicked Emperor being non-wicked can be inferred by paying attention to the setting. Hirou killing Dolf is a choice which could easily have gone the other way, whereas Yuuki summoning Satan is essentially inevitable from the moment she's put in position to summon a demon of her choosing.!< Et cetera. Girl Corrupted's ending *does* have components which lack that sort of inevitability and just have foreshadowing of the same sort that Sword of Good's ending has (e.g. >!the manner in which Yuuki befriends Satan!<), but it also has many components which *have* that sort of inevitability, and it's *that* which really makes the story as good as it is as far as I'm concerned.

        (Of all of EY's stories that I've read (which is... I think all of his original ones, plus many (but not all) of his fanfics), the only other one I can recall offhand which really has some of the same sort of thing is HPMOR, with the reveal of >!where all of Harry's weird intuitions about the wizarding world come from!<; but it's much less central to the plot's structure in HPMOR than it is in Girl Corrupted.)

  What are everyone's favourite quests? By quests I mean the interactive fiction style popularised on 4chan and subsequently used on forms like Spacebattles, Questionable Questing, Sufficient Velocity, Fiction.Live and so on. For people wanting a quick run down, I recommend this essay on Quest history [Interactive Fiction: A History of Questing](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/interactive-fiction-a-history-of-questing.19687/).

    **[Polyhistor Academy](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/)** over on QQ, following a first-year student in a magical academy where students are encouraged to murder one another in order to graduate. Does a great job of keeping the stakes high and in managing its three separate magic systems. The first thread pre-dates the threadmark system, so you'll need to navigate by clicking through from one post to the next. Currently in the middle of Year 2, with mistakes from first year coming home to roost and things not looking great for surviving through to the end.

    If you enjoyed Worm, I'd at least take a look at **[PRT Quest](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18xcEYRK0Ts-k6--ZOuDFh-ILK9hLzcgkDTIf6L_G90s/mobilebasic)**. Written by Wildbow himself, the players took on the role of a new PRT director in Anchorage, Alaska.

    **[The Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/)**. Definitely NSFW, surprisingly deep.

    The aforementioned **Forge/Threads of Destiny** and **Marked For Death** are also great. A special mention goes to the Avatar: The Last Airbender quest **[Deep Red](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/deep-red-avatar-the-last-airbender.50358/)** for convincingly managing to get the Questers to railroad *themselves* into the canon storyline through their wishy-washy interactions with Zuko's family.
    ```

  - u/Igigigif:
    ```
    In addition to the other quests already mentioned here:


    Active/Complete:

    * Divided Loyalties: A warhammer fantasy ck2 quest from the PV of a spymistress and shadow wizard. Great sense of progression, and while lucky rolls happen, the story isn't dependent on them.
    * A Destiny of Strife: A bleach inspired hollow quest. Features a protagonist with a penchant for dramatic speeches, implausible adventures, and honestly really solid characterization all around.
    * Where Nightmares Fear To Tread: A silly/fluffy quest where you play as an eldritch embodiment of fear protecting a little girl. World-building is good, but the update structure makes non-archival reading somewhat dull.
    * Even Further Beyond: I can't recommend this enough. The prose is fantastic, the world- and magic-building is top-notch, and the narrative and character arc are great. You have a giant xianxia empire in the same world as Tolkien elves and 3.5e wizards, with the protagonist as the destined evil overlord whose predestined death will mark the end of the age of cultivation. Its complete and only about 3 pages in reader mode.

    Incomplete:

    * Seeing Red: Naruto SI, but far from the only one in the setting. Good world-building, very hype, but mc get overpowered very fast. Still manages to create tension despite that
    * White Collar Cultivator: Some guy from earth get kidnapped and press-ganged into an ~~evil~~ cultivation bureaucracy. Fortunately, the benefits are great, and a modicum of skill with office politics can be extremely rewarding.
    ```

  - u/Iwasahipsterbefore:
    ```
    Marked for Death, a rational Naruto quest is fantastic. It's run on SV. Choices matter, and plot armor doesn't exist.

    The voting system is also interesting. Most quests give you several options during each update, MfD has completely open ended voting. We're encouraged to keep votes under 400 words for an xp bonus, but that's it.

    Our character is talented, upper 3/4, but not S tier. Everything we have we've gotten through exploiting in game systems, which is explocitly encouraged. 

    "If you can break the setting in a way that conceivably hasn't been done before you got here it will be allowed."

    We've already done it once, and are always looking for more people to join the hivemind to help us do it again.
    ```

    - u/fortycakes:
      ```
      As someone who's been lurking Marked for Death since the beginning, I can second this recommendation. The portrayal of characters and a living world is excellent, and it's a good rational take on the Naruto setting. There are chapters that have given me the wrenching feels or urge to exultantly shout "Yes!" at the page that I'd normally only expect from genuinely brilliantly written novels.

      That said, it also consistently throws up issues about exactly how is the best way to run a quest - how much agency should the PC's characterisation have vs how strictly should the voted plan be followed? After a few things like the Youthsuit Incident, it seems to have settled into a reasonable compromise. 

      It remains a more socially-exhausting environment than I want to interact with for fun, due to the fierceness of debate and occasional salt levels, so I'm still going to be sticking to lurking and maybe occasionally voting for the foreseeable.
      ```

  - u/GlimmervoidG:
    ```
    To start off with, I'd recommend [Forge of Destiny by yrsillar](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/forge-of-destiny-xianxia-quest.35583/). It is a Xianxia style story that dodges most of the common pitfalls. While the protagonist is clearly talented, she isn't the strongest person ever, who effortlessly brushes aside the arrogant young masters. The story is well paced, carefully thought out, with gradual but meaningful power growth.

    >In the Celestial Empire, a land ruled by Immortals and stalked by Spirits and Beasts, a young girl from the slums of an unimportant city is found to have the Talent. In the great Sect of Argent Peak, she will take her first unsteady steps upon the way.

    I enjoy All Night Laundry. Time travel, plots, time traveling plots. The actual questing part is pretty much over, as the author is wrapping it up and tieing off the last loose threads.

    http://www.all-night-laundry.com/

    Note: The bar at the top of the page shows your farthest read comic, and a link to reset that. There are several time loops that actually alter previous pages, and the first few chapters have all been corrupted by paradox. So if it's all "i SEV ?wbbpu :AQ O!Yt" just press the reset button to clear that up.

    [Sins of Cinnamon, NSFW](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/reader) alternate game system universe/pseude time travel shennanigans? High quality prose, for now on hold until author finishes their same universe world building quest [days of Thyme](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-days-of-thyme.9683/) which is also currently very slow at updating. 

    My endorsement quote is: "Reality strains to remain backwards compatible to you." which without in-story context would be such a sick burn and kinda the better version of "ok, boomer". In-universe its even better.
    ```

  - u/TheAnt88:
    ```
    Now You Feel Like Number None \[Bleach Arrancar Quest\] on sufficient velocity as it greatly expands the lore, is very well written, the choices matter, and for once the main character while growing stronger is limited by design to never become powerful enough to wreck the setting as she has hard limits on how strong she can grow. She changes the plot by forming connections with others, fostering rebellion in a believable way, and helping other characters grow stronger instead.
    ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Other than the already-mentioned *Forge of Destiny*, currently my favorite is the Warhammer Fantasy quest [**Divided Loyalties: An Advisor's Quest**](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/warhammer-fantasy-divided-loyalties-an-advisors-quest.44838/). You play Mathilde Weber, a Journeywoman shadow mage of the Empire, shoved into the position of Spymaster for a newly chosen Elector Count of Stirland by a mysterious conspiracy. 

    Just about everything about this quest is top notch, it's so damn fun. The world is rich, the characters are well-developed, and the writing leaves little to be desired. Catching up before the end of our current mini-arc will allow you to experience Mathilde's Bullshit in its entirety.

    Some of my favourites have already been listed here, but I'm going to throw in After The End, a Dragonball quest that takes place after Dragon Ball Z/Super. After Goku and Vegeta died of old age, a mysterious foe came to Earth to fight the Z-Fighters... and killed them all. The last of the Saiyan's descendants fled to an isolated corner of the galaxy, to live in fear of this Enemy, hiding what they are, hoping to never been found.

    Centuries later, we start with Kakara Goku, heir to House Goku - one of the extremely few who are allowed to reach the pinnacle of strength - at least, of what is deemed safe from detection... Super Saiyan.

  I'm going to recommend [The Loyal Ones.](https://thralls.weebly.com/novel-index.html) It's a serialized biopunk story about a slave in an england-ish nation fighting against the hordes of a faction I don't understand yet. Solid writing and worldbuilding so far, and the author has accompanying art pieces that are pretty great.

  I'm also going to semi-recommend [Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve). Solidly written LitRPG. Falls prey to basically all the stuff I don't like about LitRPGs, but it well written despite it.

  Finally, I'm going to re-reccomend the webcomic [Poppy](https://www.poppy-opossum.com/comic/poppy-8-page-34/) which is about funny animals in a magical world. Also, occasionally, it gets anime as fuck, with fight scenes I could almost swear are animated. Unfortunately on hiatus, but the existing content is more than worth reading.

    Out of curiosity, what don't you like about LitRPGs?
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      LitRPGs almost invariably use their game system as numbers-go-up wish fulfilment, rather than having them actually add anything to the story. Usually the video game veneer ends up being nothing mora than an excuse for the author to not think up a consistent magic system. I actually tend to enjoy exceptions to that rule, like Log Horizon (my favorite anime),.

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    If you can isolate what it was about Isekai Speedrun that you found enjoyable you might get more recommendations, but off the top of my head I can't think of anything that "feels" like it. That story was a very odd duck.

    Edit: actually after thinking about it I realized that Isekai Speedrun is, in a lot of ways, similar to a Doctor Who episode - except from within the Doctor's perspective, where you can see the mad improvisation based on meta-knowledge as it happens. From that perspective I'm pretty sure I can recommend [Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy), though I don't remember finishing it and also it updates fairly slowly.

    In order of most worth checking out to least worth checking out:

    &#x200B;

    [Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve) is a litrpg about a dude from Earth waking up the middle of a forest in another world. He quickly ends up in a town so there's no "random dude trying to survive in the wilderness for 20 chapters" arc thankfully, but has to learn the language from scratch and the early chapters are him trying to eke out a living in a fantasy world killing slimes in the sewers and such. Later on he finds some friends and actively works on a party-friendly build rather than the litrpg standard of broken bullshit solo-only god build. The story gets crunchy, with the MC actively scribbling down tables to work out the most efficient distributions of mana/metamagic multipliers, which the fact that the average dude he's encountered doesn't do that (partially because their number system has no concept of zero makes it difficult) is kinda anti-rational arguably, but you could counter it with the lack of general schooling and education in the world. The overall story is quite enjoyable (I joined the author's patreon, which is $2.50 a month for 6 chapters ahead of everyone iirc) and also updates twice a week, Thursdays and Sundays at the same time (although he skipped one update around Thanksgiving due to "personal stuff" then released a double-length chapter where shit hit the fan last Sunday). It's almost 70 chapters long and has a bit over a book worth of writing if I had to take a stab at length.

    [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) is about a bio-weapon escaping a lab and trying to blend into and understand human society. Except the human society is America \~100 years from now when a small chunk of the population either has super powers or were horribly mutated as a result of highly stressful situations and some convenient viruses. World-building is interesting, there's some well-done humor in there, updates are decently sized and happen a few times a month. You could easily argue some of the actions of the side-characters and how accepting they are of the MC are not rational, but in the greater scheme of "the world is fucking weird now" it's not too out there. It feels like it's still on "book 1" in that the first major antagonist/mystery/"whatever you call someone frankensteining mutant/human body parts onto giant rats is" is going on, but there's quite a bit of set up before that so it's over the length of a standard novel as is. There's 37 chapters currently, but the author has a haphazard update schedule. The novel started a year ago and churned out updates multiple times a month, then went to an update a month for \~8 months, but recently updated 4 times in the past month, so the author might be back in the swing of things.

    [Hive Queen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/22115/i-dont-want-to-be-the-hive-queen) is your standard Isekai start, except the dude gets turned into a humanoid-sized/shaped insect queen and dumped in a forest by his new "parent" all alone. Takes a bit to get going but is certainly original in some of the world-building aspects. 48 chapters long so far, updates slowed down to around twice a month after starting a year ago. Feels like it's still on "book 1" even if length wise it's crossed that margin due to the first big antagonist (goblin army) being dealt with right now, akin to the previously listed novel.

    [Chimera](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/20364/chimera) is also decent but on some sort of hiatus/iffy update schedule. Plot is a mix between Hive Queen and Super Minion (partial isekai of protag into alien monster/body/consciousness/world-view).

      I *really* like Super Minion.

    I also second this.

    And [Confessions of the Magpie Wizard](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/27872/confessions-of-the-magpie-wizard) I feel is higher quality than usual but isn't rational to my understanding. 

    It's about a modern day world that got invaded by (from what I understand) Christian devils and with them comes humanity's ability to use magic. The story is told through the lens of a devil spy far in the future looking back at his past. He infiltrated a Japanese magic academy.

    World building wise it's interesting as multiple human counties fell at the start of the invasion. Magic wasn't a thing until the devils invaded and the two sides (humanity and devils) have an incomplete understanding of each other. The devils seem to have invaded at least another world before and that gave them the minions and animals they use. Last thing would be it isn't finished and has 22 chapters posted as of now.

    Seconding.

  Are there any self insert quests?

  Both historical or fanfiction is interesting to me but not original content.

  Examples could be a quest where you wake up as Hitler in 1939 or where you wake up as Ron Weasley in 1992, etc.

  All you have is the knowledge, no extra powers or litrpg things

  ```
  I’m looking for any decently munchkiny fanfics of Sym-Bionic Titan. The ones I saw on FFN all seem to be war stories or shipfics.

  ```
  Hello, I'm new. Can we post requests if it isn't Monday? 

  If so, I'd love to read something like Greg Egan, Sam Hughes, or Scott Alexander. Fiction that will teach me something :) Completed novels are easiest for me.

    Yes you can! We usually use this thread the entire week. Here's a completed short story that's fairly idea packed, more in the vein of Scott Alexander: [Sekhmet hunts the dying gnosis](http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/sekhmet-hunts-the-dying-gnosis-a-computation/)  


    You might also enjoy Vernor Vinge's "Rainbows End" and "A Fire Upon the Deep".

    ```
    Have you gotten into Neal Stephenson? I like Diamond Age a lot, but people seem to enjoy Anathem. Cryptonomicon is starting to feel like a product of its time but it's also a great doorstop read. If you like cyberpunk a la William Gibson, you could also kick back to Snow Crash, though it's substantially different from most else he's written.
