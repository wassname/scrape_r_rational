I submitted this story for the Reverse Portal Fantasy prompt a couple months ago. I'm still updating it, and I'm curious to see what people on here think of it.

  Like chaosmosis, I was bored with the first scene. I skimmed over that section without really reading much. After that scene, it got a lot more interesting.

  My advice is to just start with the second scene. The first scene's information can be included later on, once people are sufficiently invested in the story.

  For the sake of providing feedback no matter how useless it is, I started to read this and got bored within a paragraph. The situation itself wouldn't necessarily be boring, but your description was. You just say "gods", "outer realm" or whatever. Maybe if you had given a visual description my attention would have been better hooked.
