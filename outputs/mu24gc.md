  I'd have preferred *Eliezers Yudkowski*, but that's just a personal preference.

    I've read the comic for several years now. I'm pretty sure he would have done that if he'd thought of it.

      I was more referring to [this one](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/plural), but that one is good as well.

    I thought you were referencing the Cedrics Diggory from r/HPMOR lore, but an inner SMBC reference is better
    ```

    - u/Iconochasm:
      ```
      Cedrixen Diggory.
      ```

    ```
    Or *Yudkowsky*, to use the correct spelling (your pluralization looks good though).

  Regarding the title text: 

  > *Thank you to the 2 people who enjoyed this joke. May the nanites disassemble you rapidly.*

  There are dozens of us! Dozens!
  ```

  - u/basiliskgf:
    ```
    not for long given the rate the nanites are replicating
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Praise the nanites.
      ```

  If it had been paperclips, I could hold my bootleg self-printed copy of HPMOR together...

  Grey tribe goo

  Hey, a typo! Those are rare in SMBC.

  > In an attempt to make world perfect, runaway nanobots...

  Shouldn't this be 'the world'?
  ```

    ```
    Yeah it should, maybe someone should tell Zach, but he's probably already aware/has been told by multiple people /did it on purpose for some meme we aren't getting. 

    It's interesting how I somehow managed to read it multiple times
    whithout noticing that, but now I can't unsee it.
    Feels like the the duplicated "the"s thing that scott used to do a lot.

      It works even better when you take care to ensure the  
      the word you're duplicating and deceiving readers with is  
      is on separate lines.
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    "make world perfect" is how it might read in a headline, so that's what I assumed it was going for; although "an attempt" rather than just "attempt" opposes that.
    ```

- u/crivtox:
  ```
  Corrigibility gone wrong
  ```

- u/Luminous_Lead:
  ```
  That is totally a gray goo scenario.
  ```

- u/Zarohk:
  ```
  Isn’t trying to convert people to any philosophy, including Yudkowsky’s brand of rationalism and AI-phobia just a psychological grey goo scenario?
  ```

  - u/netstack_:
    ```
    Only insofar as a factory making one of its own components is just a nanite grey goo.
    ```

    - u/Downzorz7:
      ```
      The *real* grey goo is people
      ```

      - u/crivtox:
        ```
        Nah plants are the real grey/green go.  
        They turn mainly air and water into more of themselves.  
        And have filled the planet to the point of changing how it looks from space.
        ```

        - u/CronoDAS:

          And the oxygen they make killed off the anerobic life that preceded them.

    In theory, there could be a philosophy that holds 15% of the population ought to X that only seeks to spread to 15% of the population.
    ```

    - u/ADotSapiens:
      ```
      The remaining 85% can have a use verifying that it is only 15% of the population who do X, surely?
      ```
