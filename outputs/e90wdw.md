I'm a lover of fiction but haven't heard the word rational, what does it mean in terms of literature?

    That still seems like a “rationally” written storyline, in the sense of consequences flowing from actions instead of from ad hoc storytelling fiat, even if the featured characters weren’t acting “rationally”. Like, I can easily envision Thorin and co. having worked so desperately hard for this success, all the while filled with clawing doubt, that when they’re met with failure at what should have been a moment of triumph their niggling misgivings surface to say “fuck it all! we were never to succeed here anyway”.

    I can also imagine a “rationalist” retelling where Thorin realizes partway through that they’ve no hope against a dragon and keeps trying to find face-saving (and life-saving) outs, having long discarded greed and pride but just wanting to reconnect with his old dwarf-college buds lol

    Alternatively, maybe Thorin reasons that the solution-space of some arbitrary dwarven puzzle is so mind-bogglingly vast that fiddling around in the neighborhood of his incorrect solution has little expected payoff. If your 32-digit keycode doesn't work, there are so many "reasonably close" codes to explore that even if you're in the right ballpark and dedicate your life to trying different codes, you'll never find the correct one (ofc this gets proven wrong when a nearby solution is indeed found, but maybe Eru had a hand in that, or something).

      you've nailed the distinction between rational fiction (with rational plot) and rationalIST fiction (with rational characters)

        Do we have access to movie-Thorin’s internal monologue throughout the film? I don’t see how supposing some measure of self-doubt as an explanation for his despair in the face of defeat is inconsistent with his prior actions. The latter two points refer of course to a different Thorin, which is why I called it a retelling. I haven’t actually watched the films since their theatrical release so maybe I’m misremembering.

        I guess I’d prefer that “rational” fiction focus more on internally consistent, realistic worldbuilding that explores the natural implications of some collection of premises, where things don’t happen merely as the plot demands. Characters can be flawed and “irrational”, even capricious, so long as their actions are compatible with their experiences and motivation, which are otherwise within the range of variation for their class. I’d sooner call the genre that features “intelligent” characters implementing clever solutions that invoke IRL book learnin’ “rational*ist*” fiction, personally.

            Well, r/hardfantasy says it has 17 people; where else would you suggest discussion of such things go, if not here?  The Wiki entry you link to is barely more than a stub, and I hadn't heard of it elsewhere, so I'm not convinced that hard fantasy in that sense is really an established and accepted genre.  I'm no rationalist--I wrote a wonkish fantasy serial and was told people might like it here--but the rational versus rationalist distinction seems useful enough to me.  Someone once said that about half of this reddit are HPMOR fans, the other half not--is this true?  If so, it seems like a good approximation for a broader rational/ist divide.

    I mean, the reason why you or I wouldn't have done that is because we're not a prickly proud dwarf lord with a sour, depressive attitude and more experience fighting orcs than puzzle solving. He is in fact the kind of person who will say 'fuck it' and leave in a huff, it's consistent with the character and his background and I don't see how thats inconsistent with "rational" storytelling.

        Actually, I can totally see any number of human beings reacting that way, for various reasons, not all of which apply to Thorin.  Certainly under stressful situations--and I think the Erebor example qualifies--otherwise sensible people can act in ways that seem senseless.  Bilbo might well act calmer and more sensibly because he has much less personally at stake where getting in the mountain is concerned.  But I'm going by a description here, since I got bored and stopped watching two-thirds of the way through the first Hobbit movie.

        ETA: Phylogenik already addressed this above, more or less.  Human, and presumably dwarf, behavior, can't be boiled down to what makes sense in pursuit of explicitly stated goals.  Sometimes you're standing by the side of dragon-infested mountain wearing chain-mail underwear, and it's been six months, and you got locked up by an elf and had to escape in a damn barrel of apples and nearly drowned plus there were goblins and spiders, and at the climactic moment you were counting on to see you through everything seems to go wrong and you say AAHHH fuck it, and go down the mountain to smoke pipeweed.  Not necessarily to start home immediately--EY's description doesn't say as much--but just to cool off and get away from the thing that's frustrating you.

            But ... that's just what I'm trying to tell you: I can easily picture someone acting in the manner described, even if they were quite intelligent.  Hell, I can see my dad acting like that, and he's brilliant.  The man loses his temper twenty times a day, forty if there are small children around.  You're talking about what a real human would do while ignoring the very real human elements of temperament and stress.  Under real-life circumstances people do not always act in the optimally productive manner they would choose if they were considering the matter dispassionately from a distance.

            To me the gimmicky part of the sequence, as described, is not Thorin's reaction but the "last light" referring to the moon.  Bit of a silly gotcha.  Also doesn't make any damn sense, because if you're including the moon as a light, what about the stars?  But I digress.

  My shorthand is "not Harry Potter."  HPMOR aside, the original canon shows breathtaking lack of concern for internal consistency or intelligent plotting.  The plots of books four and five are both ridiculous Rube Goldberg schemes to manipulate Harry into doing something extraordinarily simple that Voldemort could have accomplished with much less effort ("have Harry touch a portkey without entering a yearlong tournament" and "go get the damn ball yourself," respectively).  The books are regularly mocked, even by devoted fans, for bizarre oversights and niggling inconsistencies (as one webtoon put it, "how come they need a permission slip to visit the candy shop, but not to play murderball?").  They're still enjoyable for a lot of people, but making the world and its events plausible is plainly not a priority for the author.  In rational fic, it is.  Bonus points if the protag wins by thinking things through, and all the other self-explanatory stuff on the sidebar.

  In practice, there tends to be a LOT of fan fic, litRPGs, and so on, because that's the general trend in webfic right now.  It's not necessary for it to adhere to any particular genre, though given the emphasis on worldbuilding I think it all winds up as some kind of speculative fiction.  In theory it'd be fine to have realistic fiction where the MC is highly observant and clever, I think.

  I think of it as all the characters being people and not just "hohoho, I'm the big bad that kills people for no reason because I'm evil. In rationalF, characters are people and many of them have a "grey morality" theme where both sides are doing evil things. 

  There's several stories where the core element of the plot and the story is about tropes, Practical Guide to Evil and THe God are bastards. 

  Most rationalficiton stories seek to deconstruct story tropes and  subvert reader expectations. 

  Characters aren't idiots for no reason, there's none of that eye-rolling forced plot movement when a character is forced to do something stupid by the author.

  "Rationality" is a specific quality of any fictional work, independent of genres and settings. It describes the extent to which the work explores thoughtful behaviour of people [in honest pursuit of their goals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality), as well as consequences of their behaviour on the fictional world or the story's plot. In highly-rational fiction, realistic intellectual agency is put above established literary tropes, and all other aspects of the narrative.

  Highly-rational fiction could include one or more of the following features:

  * Focus on intelligent characters solving problems through creative applications of their knowledge and resources.
  * Examination of goals and motives: the story makes reasons behind characters' decisions clear.
  * Intellectual pay-off: the story's climax features a satisfying intelligent solution to its problems.
  * Aspiring rationalism: the story heavily focuses on characters' thinking, or their attempts to improve their reasoning abilities. This is a feature of **rationalist fiction**, a subcategory of rational fiction.
  * Thoughtful worldbuilding: the fictional world follows known, consistent rules, as a consequence of rational background characters exploring it or building realistic social structures.



  Presence of these *particular* features is not necessary: overall impression of the work is more important.

  **Adjacent tropes:** Rational stories tend to include certain narrative elements. Though their presence *doesn't* make a story more rational, this community highly enjoys them. Most important ones include:

  * [Fair-Play Whodunnit](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FairPlayWhodunnit): story's mysteries could be solved by attentive readers ahead of time.
  * Absence of [Deus Ex Machina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_machina): established story rules are never broken.
  * [Deconstruction](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction): genre tropes are re-imagined in a more realistic manner.
  * Munchkinry: characters attempt to exploit their world's rules in creative, non-intuitive ways.
  * [Genre Savviness](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenreSavvy): characters are familiar with common genre tropes and try to avoid or exploit them.

  Historically, the term was coined by Eliezer Yudkowsky to describe fiction (or, I suppose, also narrative nonfiction) that gave the reader a peek at the process of *skillful thinking*.

  By analogy, "car mechanic-ist fiction" would be a story that would actually teach the reader, by fictional example, a useful lesson about fixing cars.

  This subreddit popped into existence mostly nucleated around that original definition, but then the natural thing happened - we just started posting and upvoting whatever we liked. People have retro-codified this as stories driven by lawful rules that the reader can think about in advance, or characters not holding the idiot ball, or characters being smart even if the story doesn't try to teach you to do what they did, or stories about interesting science or philosophy.

  So the people whose first exposure to the term "rational fiction" was this subreddit (or something like it), naturally associate the term with what we've promoted via this platform, which might be loosely described as "things you'll like (or more specifically, upvote) if you also like fiction depicting skillful thinking."

    I hadn't heard the "car mechanic-ist fiction" analogy before. I like it :)

    It makes me think that there's a wider genre of which both rationalist and mechanic-ist are a part: fiction that teaches you something. It might be how to fix a car or mix a drink or think better, but there's some real skill that's being imparted. When you come to a place in your life that resonates with that fiction, you know how to do the right thing.

    More than anything else, that's what I look for.

      Thinking more, the adjective I came up with was "honest." I look for honest fiction, where the author took the lessons they were teaching seriously, and tried to make them good lessons.

  There are some things in general that rational fiction should try to avoid:

  * Don't negate cause and effect. Actions should have consequences. 

  * The main character does not live in a world tailor-made for them to succeed. The same rules that apply to everyone else should apply to them. If they are exceptional in some way, this should be explained, as well as the constraints of their power/ability.

  * Villains do not do dumb things for the sake of being evil. Look at pretty much every James Bond villain. Don't just assume the hero is dead because "no one could have survived that" (this applies to heroes as well). Don't throw someone in a cell and forget about them, giving them a chance to escape.

  * Don't mix up what is possible and what is probable. Just because something *can* happen doesn't mean it *should*.

  * Don't rely on *Deus Ex Machina*. Solutions should not fall from the sky just because the hero (or villain) needs them.

  * Consistent rules with regard to "power levels" - a character should not be inconsistently stronger or weaker just because the scene requires them to fight someone.

  * Characters, and in particular their sidekicks, should embark on the journey for their own, legitimate, reasons. Sidekicks in particular seem to always be around at the right place and time to be scooped up by the main character, and instantly join their group when they have no real reason to (and sometimes reasons *not* to).

  * Don't create world that is black and white - people have their own agendas, some might be bad people doing bad things and some might be good people doing good things, but there are also good people who do bad things and bad people who do good things.

  * Avoid harems. This is pretty typical when the main character is the hero off to save the world. Women will instantly fall in love with him. If they don't immediately do so, something will happen to make it so.

  * Character should communicate. Very often we see misunderstandings turn into something huge because someone was reluctant to divulge a piece of information.

  * Characters shouldn't immediately rush to judgement, especially judging someone based off of their appearance or character. usually when this happens, the "twist" is that the guy who was mean and gruff and reluctant to help was really looking out for the main character, trying to teach them something, or didn't want them rushing off to get themselves killed, while the nice guy was manipulating them by feeding their ego or insecurity.

  * Avoid "Evil Emperors with massive armies that appear from nowhere" - armies run on their stomach. Supply trains are a thing. An army is composed of more than just a general leading soldiers; logistics, engineering, cooks, doctors, transportation, even accountants make up and army. Soldiers need to be fed, armed, sheltered, paid. Even in an absolute monarchy, the ruler is still constrained by something as simple as crop yields.
