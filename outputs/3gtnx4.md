  It's hard too imagine two characters as different as JoJo and Lulu, though judging from the introduction of Stand it seems like this is Stardust Crusaders Jojo-- I've only watched Phantom Blood and Battle Tendency. It'll be interesting to see how this plays out, after I've finished JJBA:SC.

  Rational JoJo would be interesting to see. I can't possibly imagine how it would be done, given that JoJo lives in an irrational (or at least, bizarre) universe, but it could be fun. 

  Somehow, though, I think you'll never be able to beat the [canon fights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BgqFYrD8UM) no matter what you do. You'll lose the magic of JJBA if you ever try to change it to be reasonable.

    That scene was fucking amazeballs. Is all of JoJo like that?
