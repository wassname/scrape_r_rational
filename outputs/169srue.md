    **[Star Wars: A Penumbral Path](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/star-wars-a-penumbral-path.814685/)**

    This story starts with two initiates at the Jedi temple on Corruscant. Both of them have nearly reached the age limit where they will be sent to the agricultural corp for the rest of their lives unless a Jedi chooses them as a padawan. They both get chosen by unusual masters whose technique and philosophy differ wildly from the norm of the council. From then on the story follows their separate adventures as they learn and grow while exploring the galaxy.

    **[Path of Ruin](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/path-of-ruin-star-wars-si.541256/reader/)** and its ongoing sequel **[Danse Macabre](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/danse-macabre-star-wars-si-sequel-to-path-of-ruin.983503/)**

    The author gets issekaid into a force sensitive slave in the Sith Empire during the time of the Old Republic. His main motivation is to survive, which is nearly impossible when he's trapped as an aspiring acolyte on sith-controlled Korriban. He is quickly forced to accept that his survival requires killing other people. He tries to do what good he can, or at least avoid wanton cruelty, but that's difficult when he's constantly embroiled in sith powergames while dealing with his own growing Dark Side corruption.

  I know I'm late to the show, but I tore through the first book of ErraticErrata's new story, Pale Lights, over the past few days. I am very much enjoying it, though I keep catching myself comparing it to A Practical Guide to Evil. 

  The author goes a little heavy on the "throw out a bunch of names, concepts, and cultures without giving context" method, but a fair number of them do get expanded upon later, and I'm sure most of the rest will be in future books. Apparently the overall story also does a bit of a switcheroo after book 1, basically going from a Battle Royale death game to a magical school setting, but that's not terrible. It also helps that, while there are a LOT of characters at the start of the book, there are significantly fewer by the end, which makes keeping them distinct and memorable much easier. 

  The setting seems to be a post-apocalyptic world shrouded in darkness except for where ancient machines allow some (artificial?) sunlight through. A bunch of characters all meet up to participate in a brutal series of tests that allow the survivors to join a prestigious group of monster-hunters called the Watch, leaving behind their debts and crimes so long as they remain part of the group. It feels somewhat like Trissiny and Antonio Darling from The Gods Are Bastards join in a Battle Royale in Glimwarden's setting, with the prize of joining ASOIAF's Night's Watch. And while APGTE does get dark and horror-filled at times, this one seems to get there much sooner and with much less jocularity and snappy asides. 

  It's a different beast than APGTE, but still feels like a relative to it. I recommend reading it if you liked that series. The second book is currently being written, with new chapters released on Fridays.

    >magical school setting

    Man, magical schools are my kryptonite. I'm not sure exactly what it is about them, but they instantly kill all potential interest I have in a story. Why do authors use them so much? Couldn't think of a better way to info-dump at the audience than to force the protagonist to sit in on a lecture? Just that big of fans of Harry Potter?

    I'll still keep the story on my backlog because I enjoyed PGtE so much, but it'll be much, much lower priority for me.
    ```

    - u/NinteenFortyFive:
      ```
      Because School Settings are a very efficient way to take wildly different characters that normally would never be in the same building together and force them to interact repeatedly enough to form relationships, they are relatable experiences a vast majority of readers have been in, and their function justifies explaining fundamental concepts of the world.
      ```

    - u/PeanutaButtercus:
      ```
      Not to say you shouldn't rank your reads how you want to rank them but you got through PGtE's magical school (war college, whatever) and I can't imagine the author's second school being that much worst than the first attempt.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        PGtE barely had a magic school; it was an officer training camp that Cat got expedited through due to nepotism. It hardly even counts as one in my mind, and yet I *still* set down PGtE for like four years after it because of how much it drained my enthusiasm for the story. 

        > I can't imagine the author's second school being that much worst than the first attempt

        I can't really see why you'd feel this way? Nothing against ErraticErrata in particular, but all the time authors will write arcs or sometimes entire novels which just aren't as good as their previous works. It's entirely possible for the second attempt to be worse than the first, for a variety of factors. That's just the nature of creative works in general.
        ```

        - u/PeanutaButtercus:
          ```
          My fault for leaving a short comment open to interpretation.

          In my mind, the point of the college arc was to easily add characters to Cat's entourage and experiment with new character dynamics. This happens right after the exciting cold open where Cat immediately gets thrusted from an orphanage into meeting Black and that whole thing. 

          My comment about the second work wasn't really about subsequent works being better/equal in quality though it can easily be read that way but more regarding the school (since that's your main hangup), like:

          Hey, this is the author's patented "first arc being an exciting hook to this setting with monsters and gods and the second arc being focused on introducing characters and seeing how they bounce off each other."

          I'm probably putting too much emphasis on a throwaway line but it would be bizarre to me if it suddenly veered into HP territory when the choreographed intent is the same as the previous book's (namely political shenanigans and getting a closer look at the cast).
          ```

    - u/AurelianoTampa:
      ```
      Technically it's not strictly speaking a magical school, as only some classes are about magic ("Signs" in this world), because using magic is a guaranteed death sentence eventually and few people pursue it. It's more a school for future officers in the monster hunter army, so students pursue tracks like diplomacy, military, espionage, etc.

      The classes also haven't kicked off yet as of the most recent chapters, so it remains to be seen how they go. I expect it'll be more akin to the Legions of Terror officer program in PGtE than Hogwarts.
      ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    I would also add that for those who bounced off of PGTEâ¦ well, it depends why you bounced off but I know that a lot of my personal issues with PGTE arenât present in Pale Lights and I know a number of people enjoying this story that never got into PGTE.

  - u/viewlesspath:

    I also love wizard stories, it's unfortunate how few good ones there actually are. And the little good stuff there is has a disturbing lack of [orb pondering](https://amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/pondering-my-orb). It's sad really. 


    Most stories by [macronomicon](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19949255.Macronomicon) feature the protagonist being a pure magic user of some stripe, to the point I suspect he's a fellow wizard-phile, or at least a mage-phile. Start with Wake of the Ravager or Systems of the Apocalypse.

    [Tempests and Slaughter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17312156-tempests-and-slaughter) by Tamora Pierce, about wizard, student prodigy in a magic School. I remember liking it, but the sequel still hasn't come out.

    The [Masters and Mages](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30344847-cold-iron?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=bq8iYH4dum&rank=2) trilogy starts with a young man going to magic University in an alternate Byzantium. I liked it a lot.

    The [Daniel Black](https://www.goodreads.com/series/144936-daniel-black) series is unfortunately replete with cringy harem shit, but the magic usage and world building is top notch imo. 

    --------

    Mentioned purely for completeness sake:

    Mother of Learning is a classic you've no doubt already heard of. The author's new story, Zenith of Sorcery, is likely to appeal in a similar way, though it's still in very early stages. 

    Dresden Files, as stereotypically wizardish as you can get in urban fantasy.

    Kingkiller Chronicles, unlikely to ever be completed but what there is is pretty good.

    I was surprised by how much I liked [Skitterdoc](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/skitterdoc-2077.109765/), a worm/cyberpunk 2077 crossover, 420k words and counting, that I saw recommended here a few weeks ago. 

    The start is pretty lame(I hate it when the author overfixates on 'justifying' the reason for a crossover) but after that it gets better. There's a definite feeling of progression to Taylor, as she gets slightly nefed bio tinker powers in the setting and so most of her power rests on her slow and gradual efforts at cybernetic self-augmentation. 

    If the story is going where I think it's going (hint:>!warrior entity and thinker entity!<) then it's going to be one of very few fanfics with an actual, telegraphed ending.

    The one con to the story is that the story is sorely missing an antagonist for Taylor, anything to provide a feeling of danger in order to move the plot, but if you like Slumrat and that Warby's other stuff that probably won't be an issue.
    ```

    - u/lillarty:
      ```
      Seconding Skitterdoc. And if anyone else bounced off it on release because of the Brockton Bay sections, it seems those have been entirely removed at some point. Now it's just the good (Cyberpunk 2077) half of the story.
      ```

  - u/Dragongeek:
    ```
    I mean, if you liked Industrial Strength Magic, the rest of Macronomicon's stuff is probably right up your alley, especially the *Apocalypse* series which I feel is better than the other series and actually (gasp) is complete and has a satisfying conclusion.

    Ar'Kendrithyst is a bit divisive but it's super long and keeps getting better and bigger. MC isn't competent at first, but grows more competent over time. Not everyone's jam but it is one of the best jams I've ever had. 

    Super Supportive is pretty well liked here. 

    Book of the Dead by RinoZ is pretty good. MC is a necromancer who has to hide from people hunting him, because necromancer is a banned class. Sounds a bit generic but the implementation is good. He has to really work his guts off to get anywhere, and he's definitely not OP. 

    Jackal Among Snakes has a competent MC. Wiki editor for a CRPG game gets isekaid, uses his deep knowledge to kickstart different plots.

        The protagonist starts off as a hardline pacifist, as in he's not willing to commit violence in a violent world even after violence finds him. He's also not the smartest protagonist out there, he makes some dumb mistakes that really screws things up later down the line. These two qualities aren't very well liked by some people here, because you get an irrational mc in a rational world rather than rational mc exploiting a rational world. 

        If you're willing to give the characters time to grow though they really, really change, while still keeping to their roots. The protagonist doesn't stay pacifist, and he learns from his mistakes.

    ...[Order of the Stick](https://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html)? On the off chance you haven't heard of it, it's a long-running comic strip about D&D characters in an original setting. Starts off as a joke-a-day dungeon crawler poking fun at metagaming and rules shenanigans, expands into...well, it can still be joke-a-day, but there's a cool overarching plot, escalating stakes, and a great stable of characters. Pretty core to the [RPG Mechanics 'Verse](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RPGMechanicsVerse) trope.

    There's that one Worm crossover in which Taylor is flung into Eberron, the D&D setting, at the same time a powerful psionic arrives on Earth Bet to study it. I dropped it when I realized it wasn't really interested in deconstruction D&D and more on using it as "the real underlying reality to everything" which admittedly got under my skin in a very particular way that won't apply to most readers. There is some deconstruction, mind you, especially on the "Taylor in D&Dland" side of things.

    Lung Fight Taylor is stuck in Eberron with a couple Undersiders and Wards plus a dog, hiding their real origins in a setting full of evil viziers.

    The other half of the story is the overpowered D&D character traipsing around Brockton Bay, which was fun for a while and had some HP and the Natural 20 moments. I stopped having fun when he "discovered" tinkertech is actually D&D magic item artificing, complete with "Entities create draconic runes as part of the blueprint and THAT'S how it all works". I dropped the story when that happened because it completely broke my trust. To me, D&D is defined by its inconsistency and by new things being discovered all the time. The idea that Armsmaster's halberd would conveniently use a rune the character is familiar with to create its tinkertech effect rubbed me the complete wrong way and made me realize the author doesn't really get what D&D is about, as far as I'm concerned. "Too much lore in that brain" to put it shittily.

    Edit: Softening up my language and trying to be more fair. I did read tens of thousands of words of this story. The quality is high, it just clashes with my personal views on D&D too much.

    To me D&D as a game carries with it some very important implications in the principles of play. For example: "the truth is hidden", "people are ignorant", and "everyone who thinks they know what's going on for sure, is for sure wrong." People in D&D don't know what's going on 99% of the time. That's where player characters come in and "find out", by running into things, usually headfirst. The story seemed primed for this, in my opinion, up until that point. The protagonist can "copy" people's magic, and is very confused about the "spells" parahumans seem to have. At the time, he's very sleep deprived and not thinking about anything clearly, so I assumed this was a kind of foreshadowing that would ultimately resolve in him having to face that the world is bigger than he thought.

    Well, turns out his confusion was not meant to foreshadow that. He had no grave misconceptions about how magic works, it's the entities who are confused, and it was just true that they had spells. Admittedly, this is me stepping on a rake by making my own assumptions, but I don't think the story would've really looked all that different up until that point.

      Author here!  I hope you enjoyed the story at least a little before you dropped it, even if it didn't fit your expectations.

      For anyone else potentially interested in [the story](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/doors-to-the-unknown-worm-d-d-fusion-crossover.1001110), the other world that Taylor and friends visit is Eberron, and the D&D protagonist does leave Brockton Bay after a while (not a spoiler, the story thread mentions upfront that that's the plan) to explore the rest of Worm!America as of the current arc and he'll eventually get to exploring elsewhere in Worm!Earth.

      > I dropped it when I realized it wasn't really interested in deconstruction D&D and more on using it as "the real underlying reality to everything".

      The FAQ in the initial post says straight out that the fusion assumes Earth Bet is an obscure Material Plane world and that Worm was running on D&D rules the whole time; it's less a fusion on equal terms than the D&Dverse eating the Wormverse, really.

      The fic doesn't claim to be or try to be a deconstruction of anything, any more than Worm itself did or was, and anyone who's actually looking for a Natural 20-esque game-rules-as-reality/lampshaded-tropes story isn't going to find it there.

      > D&D is defined by its inconsistency

      It really, really isn't.  If anything, D&D is defined by taking the huge random grab-bag of competing genres and influences from the early days and explaining and integrating them more and more over time, and 3e was the culmination of that "one unified framework for everything" philosophy.

      Forgotten Realms explains all of its edition changes in-setting so you don't have to gloss over any cross-edition inconsistencies out-of-game, Spelljammer and Planescape specifically exist to meld all of the then-existent settings and their unique cosmologies under one consistent umbrella, all of the "Let's have a wacky one-off adventure in an alternate historical or modern-day Earth!" modules started disappearing in late 1e/early 2e because they didn't fit in the new more "grounded" framework that tried to explain _how_ you get to all those obscure places, the vestiges introduced in the 3e Tome of Magic take a bunch of old obscure D&D characters that haven't appeared for a while and give them some new unifying post-disappearance lore, items and effects that would have been pure DM fiat in OD&D and 1e get hard rules and prices and such in 2e and 3e, and so on and so forth.

      The fact that 3e _does_ try to be an all-encompassing system and setting like that is why rules-as-world stuff like OotS and HP&N20 can work and be funny in the first place.

      (4e broke the pattern, of course, but then 4e broke everything that came before.)

      As for D&D being all about new things being introduced and discovered all the time (like the aforementioned new alternate magic systems in Tome of Magic), you're absolutely right!...but _the Entities_ are all about stealing and repurposing very _old_ stuff, because they don't have a single ounce of their own creativity between them, so the story's D&D translation of underlying Entity-related stuff reflects that.

      The fact that the protagonist showed up on this new world that had been cut off from the rest of the multiverse for millennia and still managed to run into some very familiar (and very obsolete) magical practices when examining Armsmaster's and other Tinkers' tech, because the Entities were doing the magical equivalent of running a decades-old Windows 95 computer that someone fished out of the city dump and refurbished with cheap used components sourced from eBay, was the entire _point_ of that discovery.

        I've edited my post some, but I feel like maybe I should also respond to the argument being put forward here:

        >It really, really isn't. If anything, D&D is defined by taking the huge random grab-bag of competing genres and influences from the early days and explaining and integrating them more and more over time, and 3e was the culmination of that "one unified framework for everything" philosophy.

        This, as a DM, is completely anathema. Yes, 3rd edition (and .5) did create this illusion, but it's an illusion. The setting is not meant to stand as written, it's meant to exist in play and be changed in the doing. To play D&D as a strict simulation of its setting seems like an "unreachable ideal" type goal that I don't at all agree with in the first place.

        That the system (across many, sometimes contradictory books) tried to act as a physics textbook for the world is true. But physics textbooks are wrong in real life! They're didactic simplifications. So are setting books full of in-universe passages and overall "simple" mechanical rules, relative to 'actual' physics equations. D&D's world doesn't actually work like it says in the book, and every new aspect that gets introduced is "discovered" and breaks the general rules set beforehand. To stat out, say, Strahd, the same way a PC is statted out, seems like an exercise in futility to me. To hold back from creating new things as DM would be a gigantic handicap.

        I understand what subculture the story was aimed at now. I did not read any spoilers before starting the story because I never do that. I think the story could've made it a point to disabuse the reader of the notion Worm's universe is being treated as an equal a la Myrmidon (which has a very similar premise) earlier on, without compromising the secrecy of the entities. Honestly, if I had known the story considers the D&D gods to be absolutely more powerful than the entities of Worm, I probably wouldn't have read it.

          Thanks, I appreciate it.

          > This, as a DM, is completely anathema. Yes, 3rd edition (and .5) did create this illusion, but it's an illusion. The setting is not meant to stand as written, it's meant to exist in play and be changed in the doing.

          As a fellow long-time DM, I feel like we're talking about completely different things when we say "what D&D is about," here.

          I'm talking about _the_ game of D&D: the implicit setting created by the rules, the default assumptions used when creating individual campaign settings, the baseline a given DM starts with when creating their own adventures, the background lore and events that are assumed to have happened, and so on.

          You're talking about _a_ game of D&D: the way parts of the setting and mechanics are combined in new and fun ways, the way a choice of various mechanical elements to include or exclude affects the play experience, how a given DM tweaks and houserules things to best fit the party and their taste, the way a player relates to the story through the lens of their PC, and so on.

          For a concrete example, if you say you're running a campaign for your party in the Forgotten Realms, there are two important parts of that sentence: "_You_ are running a campaign" (for your particular party) and "in _the Forgotten Realms_" (as opposed to some other published setting).

          The former relates to how you, as a DM, are allowed and encouraged to change anything you want about the setting; the latter relates to how there's a reason you picked FR instead of Dark Sun (or whatever), and if you go ahead and nuke the setting to de-FR-ify it as much as possible (cough cough Spellplague) then you might as well have run a Dark Sun game in the first place.

          The former relates to how Player Joe has no idea what those dastardly Red Wizards are plotting or how his PC Frank the Harper is going to stop them; the latter relates to how Player Joe came into the game knowing that the Harpers and the Red Wizards were a thing and he wanted to roleplay a Harper going up against Red Wizard-like baddies.

          And so on.  The fact that a campaign will involve players discovering new things and PCs changing the world is very important, but just as important is the fact that there are shared common assumptions that the players come to the table with beforehand and a shared common setting that the PC's discoveries and actions _contrast with_ as a campaign progresses.

          > To stat out, say, Strahd, the same way a PC is statted out, seems like an exercise in futility to me.

          See, I have the completely opposite view, which may be another source of disagreement: major NPCs have been statted out like PCs (complete with PC classes and gear and all) since the beginning of the game, so in my opinion 3e unifying normal monsters on the same framework made my job as a DM so much easier and made the world so much more immersive, and 4e and 5e getting rid of that to make major NPCs just a short stat block with a huge bag of "I dunno, the DM should make some stuff up here, I guess" stapled to it was a _huge_ step backward.

          I'm the DM, I can already make up whatever I want to.  If Strahd is a vampire necromancer, he _should_ be given baseline stats exactly how a PC vampire necromancer, and then any Strahd-specific specialness should deviate from that or be layered on top.  PCs and NPCs should be special because of _who_ they are and what they _do_, they shouldn't be special because one is a black pawn on the DM's side of the chessboard and the other is a white pawn on the PCs' side of the chessboard.

          > I did not read any spoilers before starting the story because I never do that.

          The FAQ is actually spoiler-free, just talking about the story premise and how much background knowledge you need and so on, but I could probably have done a better job of making that clear.  Sorry about that.

          > Honestly, if I had known the story considers the D&D gods to be absolutely more powerful than the entities of Worm, I probably wouldn't have read it.

          Oh, the Wormverse being a subset of the D&Dverse doesn't necessarily mean "Gods > Entities."  There are a lot of ranks of gods out there, and a lot of non-divine things on par with gods.

          Without giving any specific spoilers, I can say that later events in the story after the point where you dropped it touch on the nature and power levels of the Entities in a way you might like.

          And, to briefly address your edit:

          > For example: "the truth is hidden", "people are ignorant", and "everyone who thinks they know what's going on for sure, is for sure wrong."

          -

          > so I assumed this was a kind of foreshadowing that would ultimately resolve in him having to face that the world is bigger than he thought.

          The protagonist actually _does_ face a big revelation...it just so happens that you dropped the story at the end of arc 2, the "the protagonists get a handle on the world they've been dropped into" arc, and the revelation happens in arc 3, the "the protagonists realize that things aren't at all what they seemed to be" arc, so it's a matter of unfortunate timing, really.

          Which isn't me telling you to pick the story back upâif you didn't like it and we don't see eye-to-eye on the lore, that's totally fine by meâjust me saying that the foreshadowing _was_ going somewhere and you weren't wrong to read it as you did.
