## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've been doing some work on *Glimwarden*, preparing it for when it finally goes out of hiatus, and thinking about the problem of having a bookworm in a world that has no books in common with Earth. Basically, all of the books will either have their contents understood from context, or have their contents described enough to make the point, and will have to be sufficiently generic or recognizable so that the audience can connect. It's something that I've been thinking a lot about, mostly as a microcosm of the larger issue, which is that I'll be going from a world where I can freely reference 2017 American culture, to one where there are parallel books, thinkers, politicians, etc. It feels like I'll be losing a lot of freedom, but I'm more concerned about making sure that loss of context is going to be dealt with in a way that doesn't hurt the work.

    I think that it should probably be more fine than would be expected. Not because it's in easy topic to do justice, per se, but rather that a lot of the time people don't understand actual references anyway, and they still enjoy the media. There is a level of 'if you're reading a book then you'll be more likely to have read other books and thus understand the reference', but if I were to read "It reminded of Gretchen's work. Cold, and unrepentantly pessimistic, but enjoyable", Then it wouldn't matter that I didn't know who Gretchen was (I made him up just now), because I would be able to understand what was being implied by the reference anyway.

    I guess I could have shortened this down by saying that because most references are going to have to be made palatable to people who don't understand them anyway, fake references can be treated pretty much the same.

      Oh man, I love Gretchen's books! They're so cynical and yet oddly optimistic! The movie adaptation is garbage, though.
      ```

        Man, if you disliked the movie adaptation then you'll *hate* what they did for the visual novel adaptation. Completely butchered the MC in favour of making her more appealing for younger audiences. Honestly, I don't know how Gretchen let it pass - the studio (Gyusu Limited) had a reputation for being unfaithful to what they were adapting. The best adaptation I've seen of Gretchen's work was honestly his collection of short stories, Heverfield Chronicles. It wasn't great, necessarily, I think the serial format of the collection would have lent itself better to a TV show rather than a movie, but the acting was well done and Seffet Onnings absolutely *nailed* Destarte.

      I recently finished the first Mistborn trilogy which does something similar for its bookworm character. Any time an author or book is mentioned it's tied to a concept or idea. I don't think this is too different from how one might reference real texts or modern culture, presumably because not all readers will have read or experienced the media being referenced. Some level of explanation is required either way.
      ```

        Some of the "books" in Mistborn also might have been fake within the work.

    If it's anything like the references Melanie has dropped so far, I wouldn't fret over it. I really enjoyed her laying out eg the difference between fantasy poverty and actual poverty, or that bit about one author taking a potshot at another book by having her really naive protagonist love it.

    Have you read K. J. Parker? He does that a lot, it's interesting.

  This probably isn't the place, since it isn't really written fiction, but if anyone is interested in giving input to a DnD 5e setting with rationalist elements, shoot me a PM or something? The quick TL;DR is that in a very grimdark world, walled-off cities (ala *Tales of Vesperia* or *The Caves of Steel*) exist by pushing spells like *Plant Growth*, *Goodberry*, *Regenerate*, etc to their limits. Mostly looking for people to bounce ideas off of as far as economics and the like, so DnD knowledge isn't really necessary.

  You are living in a small city in Virginia, USA.

  Recently, there have been news reports of wolves being sighted in the countryside. Not in the Appalachians: down among the fields and pastures, wandering about. Strangely, there have been no reports of them attacking livestock, or indeed anything at all.

  In fact, a few weeks back there was a video that went viral, depicting a white-tailed deer and a wolf walking together along the edge of a horse pasture. The pair were seen from behind, walking side-by-side, before hopping over a gate and disappearing from sight.

  While only yesterday, there was a news story about a wolf and a deer being sighted within your home-city. The pair were out late at night, running through the city streets, the wolf seemingly pursuing the deer. They were seen by CCTV cameras, and a handful of people who were out late. The sightings began in a neighbourhood in the south of the city, and ended near a parking garage in the east of the city, covering a distance of about 4 kilometers. Where the wolf and deer went afterwards, or what became of the deer, are unknown.

  What would you think is happening, based on this information?

    My first thought is some kind of behavior-altering parasite like cordyceps. My second thought is hoax, though video evidence contradicts that.
    ```

    - u/Boron_the_Moron:
      ```
      Your parasite theory is very interesting. It's dead wrong, mind. But interesting!
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Knowing nothing about wolves or deer, I would assume theyâ€™re being displaced from somewhere else, presumably by a manmade project. The weird behavior could be from being in an unfamiliar location.
    ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    Is there further information we have regarding them? Are they the same individuals in the videos? Is the world otherwise just like ours?
    ```

    - u/Boron_the_Moron:
      ```
      The world is otherwise just like ours.

      They do not appear to be the same individuals. The wolves' colorations were different, and the deer in the video was male, while the city-deer was female.

      Local zoologists have no idea where the wolves came from. There haven't been any reports of wolves travelling this far south before, nor any reports of the animals crossing through Maryland or other northerly states to get here.

      It's also unknown where the wolves are bedding down. They are elusive. Their sightings are rare, and scattered all over the state.
      ```
