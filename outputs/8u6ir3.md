  The power lies in **all of them**, each according to its kind.

  Power isn't one thing, an arbitrary and yet somehow quantifiable force--an abstract distilled into a number by which one thing can be said to be more powerful than the others.

  It's like asking "What is more powerful, the Rock, the Paper, or the Scissors."

      it's is philosophical question. Its purpose is not obtain an answer but to make one think, ponder and understand the relations between concepts. It's is not a question to test her son but to make him think.
      ```

      - u/docarrol:
        ```
        Not even that. It's is not about the son and making him think, and is probably apocryphal anyway. Who was there to write their conversation down? Why write it at all if it was a lesson for the son?

        No, this is a \*teaching story\*; it's intent is to make the reader/listener of the story being retold in the present "think, ponder and understand the relations between concepts". Hakram even said it's one of great many "conversations with her son" stories that used to exist; it's just a framing convention for imparting the lessons there in.

  I love how black is invading procer. He is throwing narrative weight on his side, because the evil army destroying bringing the good kingdom to it’s knees before a brave band of heroes rises up in last minute defiance is such a powerful trope. If he plays his invasion right, the story favors him temporarily and we have already seen how all-powerful the story is in this world.
  ```

  - u/leakycauldron:
    ```
    Yeah but heroes always win the Black Crusades. How does he subvert this?
    ```

    - u/TideofKhatanga:
      ```
      I know at least one story where villains won the latest last Black Crusade so hard the setting needed a new edition.
      ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      All the heroes are currently invading Callow. Either they leave him as a fox in the henhouse, or they go after him and Cat crushes the crusade.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        To be fair, there are a lot of heroes. Like 9 near Black and another 11 near Cat. They could just split up.
        ```

        - u/sparr:
          ```
          Yeah, because the good guys splitting the party is such a winning move, story-wise ;)
          ```

          - u/melmonella:
            ```
            I mean. Explicitly is, with how often they mentioned "conflicting narratives" by now.
            ```

  >	Indrani cast him a discrete look at the mention of his assistant

  She jealous
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    10 years later, Fadila is in control of Masego's household, finances, political appointments, interior decoration and social life...

    ... until she betrays him for no reason, gets killed and has her soul put into a torture gem.
    ```

- u/C_Densem:
  ```
  Man, what's Kilian been up to? Is she still Senior Mage?
  ```

- u/TwoxMachina:
  ```
  Power is Force \* Velocity.
  ```

  - u/d3nzil:
    ```
    That sounds more like goblin answer to the riddle...
    ```

- u/leakycauldron:
  ```
  The answer to the riddle of power is socialism. Seize the means of production.


  Sounds like Warlord believed power springs from the masses, which works with what we know so far - cultures make stories, stories crystallise into Stories (through repetition? Proliferance? Faith?), people that fit those Stories gain power.
  ```

    ```
    > The answer to the riddle of power is socialism

    Rather explains why capitalistic Miezans won then, doesn't it.

  ```
  The thieving reminds me of my old D&D players.

- u/serge_cell:
  ```
  Answer to riddle is probably *belief*

  Especially considering The Riddle of Steel

  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  GoT answers this riddle, I think.  This is just Tyrion's riddle all over again, and the answer is the same.  Power lies where people believe it lies.
  ```
