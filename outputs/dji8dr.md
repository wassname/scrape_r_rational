  I would recommend rereading the Prologue to Book 3

  &nbsp;

  >“It’s not about winning, Anaxares,” the Tyrant said. “It’s about how you win.”

  &nbsp;

  >“I am Kairos Theodosian,” he laughed. “Tyrant of Helike. And I say that my **Rule** extends to even the sky. Come, servants of the Heavens. The Age of Wonders is not dead yet. *Not while I breathe*.”
  ```

  - u/NZPIEFACE:
    ```
    > “It’s not about winning, Anaxares,” the Tyrant said. “It’s about how you win.”

    "I win."

    This turned out to be a lie. Then he died for it.

    Turns out that made him win.

      Your average Hero's playing checkers, DK is playing shantraj and meanwhile Kairos has been playing underwater, 15-player Tower
      ```

  ```
  I'm tickled to imagine the Hierarch forcing himself into the Choir of Judgement and claiming a seat between the Angels, constantly giving a dissenting opinion to every Judgement. I'm not sure if that's actually what happened, but I hope that it was. All of the White Knight's coins will just land edgewise from now on.
  ```

  - u/TristanTheViking:
    ```
    The White Knight flips his coin. The coin, being Currency with Value Derived from the Illegitimate Oppression of Foreign Oligarchs, being used to Subvert the Will of the People Through Statistics remains midair, spinning faster and faster until the air friction causes it to melt and burst apart.
    ```

  - u/Mason-B:
    ```
    I'm waiting for him to slowly turn the Choir insane like he does with people. Then the white knight will have to grow an actual ethical philosophy and backbone.
    ```

  - u/Xan_d:
    ```
    This outcome would also be perfect for cat to use the choir to judge->kill the bard. As the Hierarch has already said she needs to be punished, also she wouldn't be able to just vanish if its heaven striking heaven .
    ```

- u/JanusTheDoorman:
  ```
  Well... shit. People seem to be thinking the Hierarch has joined the Choir of Judgment, but I get the impression more that he's locked them in an unwinnable stalemate a la Zelda vs. Calamity Ganon or Oma Desala vs. Anubis. Is there a name for this kind of thing?

  Thus, Hanno will wake up, realize he's out of touch with the Choir and that they won't be casting Judgement on anyone anytime soon, least of all the Dead King. Raises the question, though, of whether his plan to disarm them in the first place was any good.

  I mean, sure, now we're uncertain whether the Judgment Angel Not-Corpse would be an effective weapon against him, but wouldn't that be the case even if his plan had clearly succeeded and Judgment was confirmed to be out of commission? Doesn't that just leave the Not-Corpse itself as an unreliable superweapon? And ... a band of heroes counting on a superweapon to take down the Big Bad Evil Guy only to have it fail on them in the final confrontation sure does sound like a recipe for a heroic takedown with an Aesop about relying on your own inner strength.

    [Sealed Evil in a duel?](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SealedEvilInADuel) Also it feels like the getting rid of the Judgement Choir was more of the late Tyrant's plan than the Dead King I mean he even asks if it would work where as i feel like if it was planned by the Dead King there wouldn't even be the hope that it would that work left over.
    ```

- u/anenymouse:
  ```
  Huh knew it was an angel corpse. I'm almost sad to see him go out to be honest, even if it is in a way that pretty much exemplifies his character and ends his arc faithfully. Man the Hierarch too in all honesty while neither of them were what you might call "Good" characters, they were for sure good characters if you know what i'm saying.
  ```

- u/Academic_Jellyfish:
  ```
  The Bard really just wants to kill the Dead King? I'm a little disappointed, but a conflict with the Gods would probably be out of the scope of the story.

  >“Your coalition does not scare the King of Death,” Kairos told her, not unkindly, “your petty assembly of armies and treaties which you so wastefully wring your hands over. He fears only one thing in all the world, and I have torn through the perilous nets she wove against him.”

  Suggesting that when the Bard told Cat that the Dead King was attacking because he had been cornered by the passing of time, it was to give her false confidence. Might've been for a good goal though, trading horses, using Cat's coalition to kill the Dead King...except that she was really upset when the Augur disrupted her plans.

  Or I'm just reading too much into it. She did try to kill Cat in the same meeting, maybe tying up loose ends.

  Edit: I saw a comment saying that the Hierarch died to keep the stalemate going on for eternity. Which makes perfect sense, and is awesome.

    It's one of her goals, not all of them

    >The Bard really just wants to kill the Dead King?

    Basically anyone who Apotheoses, as we've known for some time now.

      Is it? Where did we learn that, and if thats the case why did she lead Sve Noc down that road?
      ```

      - u/larrylombardo:
        ```
        As I understood it, actively against only the ones who would disrupt Creation.

        Sve Noc is self contained and must be wielded from a sort of living domain, but we also don't know that the Bard isn't actively plotting their demise or if it's just too late to affect them.

        Also, I don't recall what role the Bard played with Sve Noc that would constitute them being led down a road. Was there something specific you saw besides abstaining from interference, if she even had footing through the privacy of their isolation within the Gloom?
        ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          The vision of Sve Noc's apotheosis they showed Cat heavily featured the Intercessor's interference. They tried to summon the Gods Below and got her instead, and she interrupted their ritual with a deal of her own.
          ```

      - u/vimefer:
        ```
        I don't have the reference handy, I think it was something that transpired from Neshamah's memory shards.

        As for Sve Noc, she nudged them on that road at Below's behest, so tempting mortals with Immortality and then smiting them down, might be one aspect of a bigger game between Above and Below.
        ```

  - u/LongGrainBrownRice:
    ```
    The real point here is that he is suggesting Neshemah fears the Bard, when in reality it might very well be Cat herself
    ```

- u/Rice_22:
  ```
  Rest in peace you crazy bastards.
  ```

  - u/gryfft:
    ```
    Your exhortation for a duly appointed officer of the People to shirk his duties has been recorded as evidence against you. No need to present yourself to the kanenas for punishment, they'll find you. 

    The Hierarch shall not rest so long as the will of the People endures.
    ```

- u/MisterCommonMarket:
  ```
  This was just glorius.
  ```

- u/Daddy_Kernal_Sanders:
  ```
  Gods the discord is a mess right now. I restarted an argument about the choir of judgement. And wether it has the right to judge humans or not.

  Personally I’m firmly on the “not no but fuck no” side of that argument.
  ```

- u/Manget123:
  ```
  can someone tell me why The Bard let The Tyrant live to do this? because if i remember right cat was going to kill him in the twilight but The Bard got the Grey Pilgrim to stop her and then The Tyrant did nothing between then and now but set this up.
  ```

  - u/GeeJo:
    ```
    Two possibilities:

    1. She had counted at the time on Cordelia Hasenbach becoming the Warden of the West. With the intervention of the Augur to prevent such a huge move less than one day ago, her plans are currently broken.
    2. Her plans are still on. The Dead King would have retreated, had Cordelia's weapon not been neutralised. Now that it is, he will continue to advance, and Bard has another layer of traps to spring that we haven't seen yet.
    ```

- u/bubby_cat2:
  ```
  Do we have to take Kairos at face value here? I worry he's not really bound by his curse of truth anymore, since Mercy is _in the middle of killing him for lying already_.
  ```

  - u/JustLookingToHelp:
    ```
    No, he may not be speaking truly, but his words are *important* in that way only a villain among villains' last words can be.
    ```

- u/DangerouslyUnstable:
  ```
  Is it just me or is the prose getting more and more dense? I can barely follow what the hell each chapter is saying recently because it's all so unnecessarily flowery.
  ```

  - u/FullHavoc:
    ```
    Part of it, I think, is because Kairos has played a large part in the recent chapters, and he has a flair for the dramatic.
    ```

  - u/Do_Not_Go_In_There:
    ```
    EE's writing style has been trending towards being more verbose. In this chapter, it's mainly Kairos being overly dramatic in his monologue. In others, Cat's been getting introspective since her several brushes with death, and likes to examine her actions from all possible angles. She's also a lot more eloquent than she was a year ago. So it does make for chapters that are wordier than before.
    ```
