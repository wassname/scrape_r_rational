## Question about With This Ring renegade

### Post:

Sorry if this isn't the right place to ask this. I'm reading through With this Ring right now (only on episode 17) and I'm wondering how much I'll miss out if I just stop reading the renegade chapters? So far I'm really not a fan, all they do is pull me out of the story to focus on characters/events that aren't interesting to me.

I see in the FAQ that Zoat says the storylines don't interact and can be skipped, however I notice that later on in the story entire episodes are dedicated to the renegade arc which makes me wonder if it's really feasible to skip them. For anyone who's more up to date with the story, what's the opinion on this?

  They start off pretty boring, but later on the divergence points become more interesting. If you're having a boring time with early chapters you can just skip them and you won't miss too much context.

  The big thing you'd miss would be that renegade >!became a new god and took venom-buster formula. Turning him into a big gray evil alien!<.

  Other than that, it's not too hard to pick up the renegade chapters when they actually start being interesting. They do end up each covering different ground and showing different aspects of the world.

  At least for me, they were hard to get into at first, but I grew to enjoy them a lot later. 

  It has gotten to the point that in some chapters main storyline Paul is not as engaging.

  Eventually you'll regret it, I think. There are whole arcs from the Renegade perspective, and trying to swoop back and get some context at that point is a fool's errand. On re-reads I've always read the Renegade parts, even tho they're a bit annoying at the beginning.

    ```
    For others wondering what “Objectionable Author Politics” means, in the introductory post the author refuses to respect someone’s gender. There may be more, but that was enough for me.

      He goes a little further than that. Part of the incident that got him kicked off SV was when he pulled out the "I identity as an attack helicopter" anti-trans meme.
      ```

        ```
        I will admit to being amused when the SI later visited universe negative fourteen and met a character who has been uploaded and lived in various machines at various times - including, apparently, an Apache attack helicopter.

          I stopped reading around the "not-very-plot-relevant curbstomp in space while accidentally masturbating an alien" arc, but it doesn't surprise me that Zoat went there. I'm sure he was all sorts of grumpy after being "forced" to get off of SV and wanted to unload some snark.
          ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        That meme isn't anti-trans.

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      >refuses to respect someone’s gender

      That's rather loaded wording. His stated position is simply that pronouns are for identifying someone's *physical* sex.
      ```

      - u/fljared:
        ```
        Respecting how someone wants to use pronouns is part of that though- Arguing that they only refer to someone's physical sex isn't respecting their gender identity. 

        Similarly, if someone changes their name and you refuse to call them by their new name, because you think names refer to what name a person has a birth, you're being rude.

        Also, the author has explicitly referred to said character as being a woman, (despite him having identified as a man and being a cis man up until Hero dial shenanigans)
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Respecting someone doesn't always mean doing what they want, if you think that they're incorrect. Which Mr Zoat apparently does.

          > if someone changes their name and you refuse to call them by their new name

          Heh. Orange Lantern does that all the time! He prefers to use his teammates' real names when possible, and he makes a deliberate point of using villains' real names. That's been the case since the start of the story.
          ```

          - u/fljared:
            ```
            > Respecting someone doesn't always mean doing what they want, if you think they're incorrect

            Sure, but he's wrong about pronouns referring exclusively to physical sex (after all, he uses he and she for Red Tornado and his siblings, even if/when they didn't have genetalia.)

            As to the naming thing, he does do it only for titles and not names, and then only to discourage supervilliany. No one had changed their actual names, or minded being called .e.g. 'Wallace' over 'Wally'
            ```

    - u/VorpalAuroch:
      ```
      That's not actually true. He doesn't misgender anyone outside the contents of his own head. If he wasn't the viewpoint character, no one else would know.
      ```

- u/NotReallyInvested:
  ```
  I stopped reading with this ring a long while ago(not because it was bad, just because I had no idea where it went and by the time I found it I realized I would need to reread the whole thing or be completely lost), but I wouldn’t skip the renegade chapters if I were you. I remember that the chapters do actually get better and you never know! The universes may interact at some point. Probably in an omake lol
  ```

- u/Geminii27:
  ```
  They are technically skippable - nothing in one universe/timeline has so far had a direct in-story effect on the other. However, a minor part of the overall WTR story is drawing attention to parallels between the universes, and how the Pauls act differently. It's not just "here's story #1 with Orange Lantern 2814, here's story #2 with Graven", but playing with the literary negative space and distance between the two characters. They're often presented as opposites, but the exact axis they're opposites along changes a lot, and does not always point in the direction you might expect. For instance, which of the two characters is more aligned with Law, and which with Chaos? Which with family, and which with working mostly alone?
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    Yeah, Mr Zoat definitely contrasts the two on purpose. Like today's chapter, where Paragon mentioned offhand that Challenger Mountain is on the market. If you only read Paragon, that means nothing, but if you've read Renegade, it's a bit of a gut punch.

    And Ghia'ta just joined the Paragon team, which is her first appearance in the Paragon timeline - but she has a long history already with the Renegade.

    And when Kaldur approached Paul about how he's interacting with Venturia, it's helpful to have read Renegade's explanation of Venturia's tense relationship with Poseidonis.

    If you read only Paragon, the story will still be coherent and self-consistent, you'll just be missing out on a deeper understanding of the people and events.
    ```

- u/Green0Photon:
  ```
  I've completely skipped them, and am otherwise completely caught up to date. They don't interact with the main storyline at all, and you don't need to worry about them, except in that you'll be annoyed for whenever he updates Renegade instead of Paragon, especially when he does an entire Renegade arc.

  Nobody recommend for me to read Renegade please. I tried to read it, for quite a few chapters, and while it was neat, Grayven is just too evil for me. Or rather, I just don't like the decisions he makes. Paul, on the other hand, is absolutely amazing, and I love his journey.

  OP, you're in for a treat with Paragon.
  ```

  - u/Sonderjye:
    ```
    Which parts of the reneade in particular turned you off?
    ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    You should try reading one of the Renegade arcs, without the part before it, if you haven't yet tried that. "Stars, Crossed" is the best one, since he's in a parallel universe for the duration and minimal prior context gets involved. The full arcs are much more interesting than isolated snippets (the Paragon snippets inside Renegade arcs aren't terribly interesting either).

    Renegrayven is a Large Ham, who deliberately plays the megalomaniacal supervillain for most of his time in the parallel. And he is decidely *nastier* than Paragon, then as otherwise. But, in traditional British fashion, his tongue is planted firmly though subtly in cheek the entire time.
    ```

- u/Doc_Sithicus:
  ```
  To be honest I prefer Grayven chapters to Paul ones.
  He's more interesting character.
  ```

  - u/Geminii27:
    ```
    I think that's actually somewhat deliberate; showcasing that just because one character variant might be labeled 'good', that doesn't necessarily make them the more interesting version. Or even the most human - there's a lot of discussion about Grayven!Paul being rather more down-to-earth and personable. Not to mention him building a family. Mainline!Paul is closer to the orange light and sees things from a slightly more stripped-down perspective. This has even been commented on in-universe.

    Personally, I think Zoat is trying to put the two variants at opposite ends of an axis to compare and contrast, but what the axis actually *is* varies a lot from chapter to chapter. And sometimes the axis spins in the opposite direction from what might be expected from a classic comic-book character - Good vs Evil, Law vs Chaos, Family vs Solo, Corps vs Rag-Tag Bunch of Misfits, Human vs Inhuman.
    ```

- u/Nivirce:
  ```
  Yes. You can skip them. The renegade is just an alternate version and the author was just prioritizing it in moments, but you can just skip it with no problems.
  ```

- u/Kachajal:
  ```
  You can totally skip them if you so desire. They have very little bearing on the main storyline except worldbuilding. And, if you change your mind in the future, you can easily read *just* the renegade bits.

  The episodes devoted to renegade only affect renegade. The only downside is that, once you catch up, you'll sometimes be left without any paragon updates while a renegade episode is being released.
  ```

- u/thrawnca:
  ```
  As others have said, you certainly *can* skip Renegade. However, you said that you're only at episode 17. At that point, Renegade is just a few snippets and has not really hit its stride.

  I suggest waiting to make a decision until you've finished the first six months, episode 26. At that point there's been proper divergence and some cool Renegade scenes. If you still don't like it by then, sure, skip it.
  ```

- u/Sonderjye:
  ```
  As someone who have caught up with recent chapters I actually prefer the renegade arc. The other one seems like it has progressed backwards while the renegade arc keeps moving forward.
  ```

- u/sibswagl:
  ```
  I believe Arc 30 is the first full Renegade arc. I quite enjoy the Renegade posts, so YMMV, but I think the general consensus is that Renegade is much more tolerable in full arcs (where he gets more time to be a flawed character, as opposed to a guy who gets to yell at the Justice League and kill people).

  That said, if you’re not enjoying Arc 30, please skip it and then try Arcs 36 and 37. Despite enjoying Renegade I’ve still never finished Arc 30, so don’t let it turn you off him. 

  If 36-37 aren’t your jam either, then feel free to drop him completely. He has not interacted with the main story yet, and AFAIK will not in the future. And while some of his arcs have a parallel mostly-unseen Paragon version, you can usually figure out what you missed without reading the arc.
  ```

  - u/greenskye:
    ```
    Made it to Arc 30 and to be honest I was enjoying the Grayven stuff so far, but Arc 30 is just... boring. I'll probably skim the rest and then pick up renegade after this arc. Just not grabbing me so far.

    I enjoy the more ruthless side of graven, but I feel like Voat is sometimes forced to push him into needless cruelty just to make him more different from Paul. I've enjoyed WTS so far because it seemed to focus on what a real person might do in a comic book universe, but the paragon/renegade split seems to force personality traits outside the norm of what I think a real life human might express. The whole "bash on the amazons" thing felt really forced and a poor way to advocate for change. Grayven was basically a caricature of that friend who says they aren't a bitch, they just tell it like it is.
    ```

    - u/sibswagl:
      ```
      Yeah, that was also my problem. Very few canon characters well-known enough for me to care. Grayven is fun, but can’t carry a whole story arc by himself.
      ```

- u/VorpalAuroch:
  ```
  I would suggest you read the snippets of Renegade up through the first primarily-Renegade episode. (I think that was the visit to the Un-Men and their city.) If you still don't like it then, you probably aren't going to start liking it. Though you may end up going back to the Renegade archives when you run out of Paragon; daily updates are daily but it's still faster to read it than to write it.
  ```
