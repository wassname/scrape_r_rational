## Effective Cinderella, or, the Last Disney Princess.

### Post:

The fairy godmother glowed and sparkled like the sun seen through three dozen layers of faceted glass, lighting up the grass beneath her feet and the nearby tree like a church floor lit by a stained glass window.

Not even those bright flowing colors could illuminate the dull grey rags worn by the scrubbing-girl, or the streaks of ash covering her skin, but the scrubbing-girl's eyes shone in the fairy colors like golden dawn.  Hope was in them, for the first time in years.

*One wish - one wish and one wish only -*

The fairy godmother was smiling brightly.  "Just say the word, and I'll make you a carriage, and horses, and a coachman, and the most beautiful dress you ever saw!  It'll only last until midnight," the fairy godmother winked at her, "but you can do a lot in one night, if you hurry!"

Would ANYONE really use their one wish just for that - for a dance at the ball, and a dress that only lasted until midnight -

The scrubbing-girl shut her eyes and thought.  Even if the magical part of the wish couldn't last past midnight, she might wish to be transported to the place where her truest love could be found, or wish for all the justicers and every person of her city to know her father's true testament and how her stepmother had cheated it.  The magical knowledge might vanish come midnight, but they'd remember *having known it*.  She could wish doves to descend from heaven, fall upon her stepmother and stepsisters and pluck out their eyeballs, even if the doves were magic the wounds would stay.

The scrubbing-girl shook her head, quietly to herself.  She was a good enough person not to do that, if not so good a person as to not even think it.  And she wouldn't waste her one wish, they didn't *deserve* enough power over her to have her lose her one chance.

Her father had taught her to read, before he died, and she'd read from her father's collected books, when her stepmother wasn't looking.  Even the esoteric books, the dangerous ones, the tomes the Church might have burned.  A fairy's power was strange and vast, but limited; a fairy wish couldn't make literally everything better, not even for a single night.  There were kingdoms beyond the kingdom, and worlds beyond the world, and a fairy's wish couldn't change so much, not even temporarily.  But so long as it didn't change too much at once, and didn't last too long, she could have very nearly *anything* - briefly.

Going to the ball might not be as stupid a wish as it sounded.  Fairy wishes were like that.  Maybe the Prince would fall in love with her there, and stay in love even after her bright dress vanished and was replaced with rags, and then she would be a queen, together with her true love.  The godmother's suggested wish might not *just* give her a night at the ball, it could be her very own happily ever after, and then she would rule the kingdom relatively wisely and well, and many people would benefit thereby.  That could be her destined story, she was probably already *part* of that story, the fairy-tale was happening all around her.  The handsome prince's ball, and the scrubbing-girl left behind.

So the question just was... was she content with that story, the one already being enacted around her, the fairy-spun tale that had given her this one fairy wish?

There was parchment in her father's study, and ink, and her father had taught her writing.

You could do a lot in just one night, if you hurried.

Cinderella opened her eyes, and within them was the fire of a thousand scrubbed-out hearths.

"I want," Cinderella said, "to change my story, to leave this life and start down another path.  Fairy godmother, fairy godmother, until midnight of this night I wish to know the road I must take to find the keystone of all things, and the secret for making changes."

    Tiffany Aching met her fairy godmother at age twelve.  Then hit the Fairy Queen with a frying pan and rescued the prince, before becoming a witch.

    Seriously, you can't try to subvert a Prattchet story.  It's been done for you...

      The only place left to go is the double-subversion. The main character does *exactly* what you'd expect a storybook heroine to do in every situation, because she's caught between incredibly powerful magical forces and she's doomed if she forfeits her plot armour even for a moment...

      ... actually, I think Pratchett's done that one as well. Never mind.

      Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

      In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

      Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

      “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

      The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

      Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

      Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

      L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  I don't quite understand what "the keystone" is supposed to be from the content of the story, so I'm worried that the Fairy Godmother would be similarly puzzled and may take it literally, i.e. "follow this yellow brick road to the Library and you can learn to be a scribe!"

  I get that it is similar to the Aladdin and Princess Jasmine omake -- and perhaps it builds on top of Jasmine's last wish!

  (Side note: the Jasmine and the Lamp Omake ends with "I wish for everyone's intelligence to gradually increase at a rate of 1 IQ point per year." The intent of this wish is evident to me, in terms of creating a gradual and inevitable intelligence increase for the immortal and vigorous "everyone," but IQ is based on a norm with median of 100 and a SD of +/-15... so the educator in me wants it clarified that the term IQ is meant to refer to criterion-based tests at the time of the wish rather than using the norm-referenced definition, since Jasmine is wishing for the goal posts to shift each year.)

            I don't think that's possible because math is really good at describing any kinds of rules. There is [this story](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/03/the-study-of-anglophysics/) where the physics is based on linguistics but I think even that could be described with math (math is not just about numbers).

            Try using math to describe that, and it will fuck you.

    Parliamentary? hardly optimal.

      Personally, I think parliamentary demcoracy is a bunch better than most other structures of government.  It's democracy in a nutshell: messy, but ultimately nonviolent and *actually effective*.  This is a contrast to presidential and semi-oligarchical "democratic" systems, in which the misguided impulses of the population are blocked from implementation because *the vast majority* of the population's desires are blocked from implementation, quickly degrading into *outright* oligarchy.

      In multi-party, proportional-representation parliamentary systems, elections can be high-entropy random variables, and their outcomes *actually explain substantial portions of the variance in which laws get passed*.  Mixed-member systems then give many of the stability benefits of more regional systems without the drawbacks of oligarchical ones.

  I liked the recognition that a simple fairy wish for a night at the ball is really quite a bit more than that - what comes after is an implicit part of the offer.

  Come to think of it, this is much like what real godparents are supposed to provide - advice and resources to help you to a better & independent life.
