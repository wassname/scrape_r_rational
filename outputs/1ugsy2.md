  I think this might be the polar opposite of rationalist fiction; it seems to explicitly endorse all forms of insanity.

  There is, of course, much more similarity between a thing and its opposite than between two randomly-selected things. Which are more alike: blue and yellow, or blue and an armadillo?

  Edit: ...and in the next thirty seconds of reading after I wrote that, I encountered the word "antirationalism" in the text for the first time.

  What I love about this trilogy is that each book illustrates a different interpretation of quantum physics. Book 1, *The Universe Next Door*, is in accord with the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics. Book 2, *The Trick Top Hat*, has characters connected through non-locality. And book 3, *The Homing Pigeons*, is in an "observer-created universe" in which consciousness causes wavefunction collapse. Preeetty cool.
