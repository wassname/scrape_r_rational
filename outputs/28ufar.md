  Figured as much. The second Deadshot showed up, he looked like a chink in Luthor's armor.

  Very remarkable developments. This story's writing continues to be top notch.

    TIL that Floyd is an assassin called Deadshot.

  I love all of your stuff, so I feel bad that the first time I comment on it is criticism, so apologies.  That said, I think this is a pretty serious case of Lex holding the Idiot Ball.  Given what he knows, and his deliberate attempt to increase the strength of Superman's anchors, your Lex would probably have immediately seen to the active protection of Martha. Instead, he sent in a ruthless killer with such vague instructions as to leave him confused about how important it was to keep her alive?  

  I get that this was/will be a crucial turning point, but avoiding moments like these is pretty central to rationalist writing.  I'm trying to come up with an alternative that's more in keeping with the setting/characterization (as all of us rationalist fanficcers are wont to do) and it seems like this could have been written to put Floyd more at fault.  Even though we need Superman to blame Lex, you already have indications that Floyd was being affected by the job.  Lex could reasonably expect Floyd to do the job while keeping Martha safe (given his perfect record), but Floyd being fed up with idealistic/boring Martha leads disregarding the order to keep her alive.  He then simply lies about his orders to Superman which adds some nuance to the later confrontation.

  I'm still really enjoying your take, and am excited to see the real underlying psychology of your Clark.  Superman is my one true fandom because I love what he stands for, but it still takes a lot of effort to create a head canon that maintains enough realism to keep him inspirational.  My gratitude goes out to anything clever rationalists can add to that.

    I always appreciate the criticism - and that specifically was something I was thinking about while writing. Some of it will be addressed in future chapters, but if it's currently seems implausible/idiotic then it's something that I can work on fixing. So here are some ideas - I'd appreciate you letting me know what you think would work best.

    * Floyd was given explicit orders to keep Martha safe, but simply failed in some way - either by miscalculating how hard to hit her to knock her out, choking her on accident with the gag, or getting into an actual altercation with her in the course of trying to get her away from the farm wherein he uses too much force.
    * While Lex Luthor wants to keep Superman anchored, making the trade of Martha Kent for the spaceship is one that he'd make with eyes wide open if he had to do it again - since Martha Kent is going to die at some point anyway, and the spaceship might offer some permanent solution to the Superman Problem
    * Include more dialogue with Martha and Floyd as he makes more of an attempt to keep her away from the farm, or retrospective internal dialog where he realizes that he's made a mistake.
    * Include more of an introduction to Floyd that justifies his employment - his skills that extend beyond murder, his (seeming) consummate professionalism, etc.

    Of course, Floyd was never meant to be there in the first place, and he didn't actually intend to kill Martha Kent, just knock her out. It's a fuck up to be sure, but mostly what I'm worried about it making it a fuck up that's consistent with current characterization/motivations.

      It's clear that one of the focuses (the focus?) of the story is the justified paranoia of what an unleashed Superman could do. So especially given that Lex doesn't know what's in the storm cellar, he couldn't know whether what's inside is worth the trade of killing Martha (when dealing with Superman, it better be a guaranteed "I win button" in there to even risk *his mother's life* just a little bit). 

      I think the most straightforward fix is to use your existing characterization of Floyd as an exasperated loose cannon, and have him betray Lex's explicit command in a way that Lex should not have thought possible. Deathstroke was a cool choice, but his expertise is the reason Lex would pick him, so the accident is a little jarring. I thought that it might be a deliberate lamp shading on the knockout trope (it is actually very easy to accidentally kill someone by striking them in the head). If it wasn't intended to be a poke at the trope, than someone like Deathstroke would know to subdue her more safely (old lady=asleep within 3 seconds of a sleeper hold, with drastically less risk). 

      The more mundane fix would have Floyd explicitly choose the sleeper hold over a blow to the head for safety, and have Martha suffer a stress induced heart attack or somesuch. That still acknowledges his expertise, but does diminish it slightly (even if it's out of his control).

      I didn't have a problem with it. As you sensibly established, Luthor's options are limited and Deadshot is a professional. All considered, 9 times out of 10 what he did probably would've worked. 

      As for your bullet points, I had already assumed 1, and 2 makes sense. 3 could've happen, but again it didn't because of an understandable mistake. Even if Luthor is supercompetent, he can't guarantee anything more than the regular sort of competence from his underlings. And I already got point 4 as well.

  Wow.  Or maybe 'Oops'.

  Things are not looking good...

  I have really enjoyed reading this story. Thank you for writing it. I'm excited to see where it ends up.

  ```
  So when is Superman going to go punch the people running the Federal Reserve? You know, if he wants to do some *real* good....
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I would absolutely love to write a version of Superman where he attempts to fix the United States economy by punching people, if only I knew enough about how economies work. Superman giving a speech to the chairman of the Federal Reserve about providing adequate liquidity seems like it would be really fun to read.
