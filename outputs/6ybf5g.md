## [RT][FF]Chiaroscuro Discussion

### Post:

So I've been reading [Chiaroscuro](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11267384/1/Chiaroscuro) and am all caught up on it. Was hoping to talk about it with people.

A bit confused on the technique Shikamaru is trying to learn from his dad. What does it do? Am I right in thinking that [spoiler CH 56](#s "Shikamaru created Black Zetsu when he did the technique on his first time?") or is the author implying he made something similar?

  that thought never crossed my mind.
  Black Zetsu is something that existed for centuries in canon I would believe the same applied here.



  I consider chiaroscuro my favorite Naruto fanfic. Infireforged was a close second but it was discontinued as author finished university.

  DO you know other Naruto fics on the same level?

    These aren't all rationalist, but I did enjoy them.

      Just a warning time braid has graphic child torture and rape and Team Anko.... takes a weird turn.

      I wouldn't call geniuses of hard work rational but it is hilarious

  I think it was a Black Zetsu is a shadow-"class" minion of Kaguya? I think so because Shikamaru did the shadow-bonding thingmajig it resonated with him? Any less rational and I would try to Unsong Metaphor it, but I'm not really sure.
  ```

- u/xamueljones:
  ```
  I think the author is saying that [Shikamaru](#s " succeeded perfectly in splitting his shadow in half every time he did the technique. But splitting his shadow also splits his consciousness in half which kept making him black out each time due to the mental strain. The bit about Black Zetsu is probably about how he's a part of Kaguya in the same way as a shadow is part of Shikamaru. Hence Shikamaru's shadow looks similar to Zetsu.")
