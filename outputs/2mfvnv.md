## [Askreddit][BST] If you were given a magic flask that could refill itself an infinite number of times with any one beverage (the beverage is kept at optimal temperature indefinitely), which beverage would it be?

  100% ethanol.  It's the most useful thing I can think of that still qualifies as a beverage.  

  The main bottleneck in this scenario is that you have an infinite *flask* instead of an infinite *amount*.  This means that you are limited to as much as can pour out of it in a given amount of time.  To solve this, I would build a centrifuge with the flask pointing outwards.  At 20g of centrifugal force I would be getting far more out of my flask than normal (I think 20x as much, but I don't know fluid mechanics).

  Now you have several options.  The simplest is to just sell the ethanol at bulk rates, somewhere around $0.70/liter.  I think we con do better.  One of the biggest obstacles to reaching space is that you need to have enough fuel to lift the payload the last bit of the way, and also the fuel to lift the last bit of fuel the last bit of the way (as well as the payload), and the fuel to lift that fuel (and payload), and so on and so forth until you end up with spaceships that are mostly giant fuel tanks so that they can lift the fuel to make the trip.  This flask breaks that vicious cycle.  Ethanol isn't the best rocket fuel and it need oxygen to burn, so it might be restricted to the first stages only, but it could still make for massively cheaper spaceflight.

  ...

  Alternatively, exploit the "optimum temperature" clause to get free energy out somehow.

    This is a good answer but I don't think 100% ethanol qualifies as a beverage, maybe a high proof drink like moonshine *may* qualify but since it is illegal then the highest proof legal drink would be like 75%.

      95% ethanol Everclear is legal to buy in 36 US states.  It's mostly used to mix drinks, but it people do take it straight (often for dares/bets).

  *Any* one beverage? You might want to narrow that down.

  Right now I'm thinking it would be filled with water from the fountain of youth (the flask is already breaking rules, so I'll take a mythical drink).

    Someone said Felix Felicis on the other one. Health Potion is a vialable option, though personally I'd go with Worm's Superpower Lottery Drink for the fun of it.

    However, in the interest of breaking things, and if you're counting imaginary beverages anyway, you might as well choose to fill it with 'magic water that turns into/does whatever I want once I pour it out of the original container'.

    Edit: That's totally a real, fictional beverage, it's called 'miscellaqueous' and is described in this work of fiction [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2mfvnv/askredditbst_if_you_were_given_a_magic_flask_that/cm3xlpf).
    Obviously the first things you'd produce are a coating for the original flask imparting invincibility and other useful properties, a tonic to do the same for yourself, and a spare copy of the flask (not necessarily in that order)

      Yeah...fun...right....

  A quick Google search provides a list of the most expensive liquids, some of which could be described as a beverage in that I'm pretty sure a large number of people ingested them on purpose at some point.

  Blood is apparently worth over $1,000/gal, but more importantly it's, y'know, blood. Get it in O negative. Be a hero.

  LSD is worth over $100,000/gal, but it's, y'know, LSD. Renegade option, I guess.

  Mercury was also on the list. Not sure if it counts, or why anyone would choose it, but I felt I should mention it anyway.

    I think this is the best answer I've seen.

  Liquid nitrogen. I know science demonstrators who have drunk some, and having it for free would be pretty useful. Superconductors, space travel, dramatic mist, etc.

    ```
    Note: do not drink liquid nitrogen. It is a very very bad idea.

      Yeah.  They'd never do it where kids were watching, but in precise amounts the Hall effect provides a great way to give undergraduate scientists a heart attack.

      Stir a teaspoon of liquid nitrogen into a yoghurt for instant ice cream.

  Its a magic flask, so magic exists. Ego, just go straight to the elixir of life. Panacea and makes you immune to age and disease, and since it's supposed to work with even a drop, you can supply it to really large numbers of people. Not everyone, I fear, but I'd have to do math to be sure...

  A suspension of nanobots in water that will cure/prevent all diseases, repair the damages of aging, etc.

  ```
  Liquid nano-technological material capable of computation, preloaded with an Artificial Intelligence dedicated to maximizing for human values. Pour it out into a place with raw material, and then watch the technological singularity happen overnight.  In order to qualify as beverage, I guess I should specify that it can use a human host for an initial supply of raw material.

    ooh liquid computronium is great! mmm seing its a magic flask why not make it magical Computronium for extra munchkinry.
