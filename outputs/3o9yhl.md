## [BST] How would you munchkin your powers if you were a real life gamer?

### Post:

This is my last thread on the gamer power. We've looked at all the different systems individually and now we'll be combining all the powers. I've decided to write a rational gamer story after I'm done with my [current] (http://royalroadl.com/fiction/3670) story and you guys are helping me bug test. So thanks!

**The Rules:**

**Item Subpower:**

* You cannot store anything living inside

* Dead things that can rot will not rot while inside (because time, physics etc do not progress while inside)

* There is a weight/ size limit tied to your abstract level of strength or some kind of hard limit based on the size of the item box/ pocket dimension. For this we will assume 500lbs and the size of a small apartment. 

* You have to manually be touching an object to put it into your storage space, but it does so instantly. You can store anything you are touching with any part of your body (has to be bare skin that is not covered by clothes, though you could store your clothes and then use that bare skin to store things) 

* Things like gasses, plasmas, or "energy" like fire or lightning cannot be stored. Any liquids or solids can though, provided they are not alive. 

* You have to focus on storing an item and have line of sight, which means you cannot store anything that is solely on your back. You can for instance store a bullet that has been shot at you but you have to be looking at it and focusing on storing it AND still be focusing the instant it touches your skin, if you break focus you will not be able to store it. (This is not hard but getting almost hit by a bullet can break anyone's focus)

* Items are stored based on what the user considers is one item, for instance you can store a backpack on your back that you do not have in line of sight of by looking at and storing a strap of the backpack. This does though mean you can store parts of an object that you think of as it's own object. For instance you can store a bike wheel or the entire bike. No the universe is one bullshit. 

* Reflections can increase line of sight with no adverse effects. For instance you can store something behind you by looking at it through a mirror and touching it.

* You cannot transport things you cannot perceive.

* You can manifest or recall something at any part of your body, as long as it is touching you, at least for a moment. For instance you can recall an anvil at the tip of your finger to drop on your foes. Manifesting takes focus and a mental picture as well as line of sight. With practice you could manifest things in different positions or configurations such as manifesting clothes that are already on your body. The limit to the complexity is the limit of your mental model. You cannot for instance put in a Gordian knot and expect to untie it unless you can accurately go through all the steps to untie it in your mind. Manifesting is instant just like storing.

* Physics, time etc do not progress while inside storage and all movement stops while inside. This means that you cannot shoot back stored bullets or blast around on jets of pressurized air or water.

**Food Subpower:**

* You can see and monitor your health and stamina through bars, if your HP drops to zero you die, if your stamina drops to zero you cannot move or think.

* If you are cut or shot, etc you will get a wound on your body and lose HP. These wounds can cause status effects like bleeding which can be fixed by applying a bandage or will instantly be fixed upon healing the damage taken in HP.

* Any bonuses or deficiencies will show up as status effects. If you are bleeding that is a status effect, same with being drunk, or well rested and they have an effect on your overall health and stamina points.

* Physical or Mental exercise use stamina. The harder the exercise you do the more stamina is used. Mental exercise uses much less stamina overall than physical, though it can still drain you especially if you don't rest or eat.

* Hard physical or mental work, or taking HP damage will over time increase your stats in vitality and increase your stamina. This has diminishing returns and though you will never be even close to invincible you can eventually have superhuman levels of endurance. 

* Food, medicine, rest, and sleep restore your HP and SP. Higher quality food restores more points and medicine in general restores the most. Earthy foods like meat restore more HP and little or no SP while "relaxing" comfort foods like cake or cookies restore mostly SP and little or no HP. Resting and relaxing will restore your stamina quickly, even if you exercised a whole day resting for 10 or 15 minutes will fully restore your stamina. Your HP will regenerate over time also, though at a much slower rate.

* Sleep will restore your HP & SP fully and get rid of all but the most debilitating and chronic negative status effects. You must sleep for at least 6 hours for it to count and 8 or more hours will make you well rested, increasing your HP and SP by 10% for 24 hours.

* Wounds to vital areas will cause more HP damage than normal though most wounds can be fixed by restoring your HP for the amount of damage taken. Wounds like severed limbs, crushed eyes, or heart removal require high quality food, medicine or a full rest to heal. If you are fully decapitated you will instantly die.

* Diseases like colds can be healed easily by taking medicine and chronic problems like diabetes, cancer etc can be solved over time.

* You are much less likely to have any physical problems and though not immortal it is estimated that you can easily live several hundred years assuming your HP never drops to zero.

* Any severed limbs, organs, blood or anything else of your body will disappear if they are outside your body once you have healed. No infinite severed arms or organs!

* These effects will only work on you. Feeding someone food or similar actions will not heal anyone but yourself.

**Observe Subpower:**

* By focusing on an item, place or animal (including humans) you can get information (in the form of a floating window) on it that is 100% accurate even if no one else knows this information. This process only takes about a second.

* You can increase your observe skill with practice, allowing you to see more information. It becomes exponentially harder to increase your skill over time. This skill applies to everything you observe or examine.

* When examining items (which can include any object or plant) you will get a detailed report on its characteristics, durability, and uses. After practice you can glean more information from items such as value, how old the item is, and other more detailed information.

* When examining a place (which you can do by focusing on it at a distance) you will see information about it's uses, who or what lives there, danger level and other information. You will see more detailed information the higher your observe skill is.

* When focusing on a human or animal you can see things like their name, physical fitness, intellect, health, age, and skills. At higher levels you can see things like their mood, weaknesses and strengths, and even gauge what they are about to do (in general, not exact).

* Everyone, including yourself, has a nameplate above their head detailing their name and level (which is an abstraction of their combined physical and mental strength + their skills). You may be unable to examine powerful people unless you have a high level in your observe skill. If this is the case you cannot see their name, level or any of their skills or abilities.

* No one can see any of the information you see, when you examine something it will just look like you are focusing.

* Cameras, mirrors, binoculars and pictures will all work. You can observe things in pictures or videos, though there are some limitations. If you observe a person in a picture that is 10 years old you will get what they were like on that day, not what they are currently, same with items or places. You must also be able to see enough to accurately make out what the thing is. If an image is too blurry, or does not capture enough of the object or person to make them recognizable the observe will fail and you will get no information.

* You must be physically looking at something with your eyes to examine it, you cannot simply think about examining something.

* You cannot examine things that are intangible or imperceptible. You cannot for instance examine a scientific theory or a religious  belief and figure out if it is true. You cannot examine things like bacteria that you cannot physically see unless you are looking at it through a microscope.

**Statistics and experience Subpower:**

* Killing any life form gives experience based on it's level which is an abstraction of it's strength. Killing anything beneath you will give less experience eventually resulting in zero experience gained. Killing things above your level will give scaling experience. You must kill the life form with no help to get full experience, you will lose percentage experience based on percentage of damage done (If someone deals half damage and you deal half damage you get half experience).

* Completing tasks will give experience, scaling similarly to killing life forms. The easy tasks will give less experience, harder ones will give more. Hardness or easiness is based on how much focus, effort and time a task takes. In general tasks will give much less experience compared to killing life forms.

* Upon reaching an experience threshold you will level up. Leveling up gives you 5 skill points you can spend in different areas to improve yourself. Leveling is easy in the beginning and becomes harder and harder.

An example scale: http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/runescape/images/3/3a/Scapegraphzoomed.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1024?cb=20110301005916

* You can spend your statistic points on different areas of growth, to start with you have the 6 basic skills (Strength, Vitality, Agility, Dexterity, Intellect, Wisdom). 

* You can unlock different statistics by improving yourself in that area. The difference between a skill and a statistic is blurred but in general statistics are statistics are something that cannot be necessarily learned. Statistics are more of a generalization of your intrinsic abilities in a certain area. For example charisma can be a statistic but not speaking. Focus is not a statistic but you can argue willpower is, because it's a general intrinsic ability.

* Aside from leveling you can also increase your statistics by doing actions that are associated with a stat. (For instance lifting weights for strength and learning for wisdom). Training your statistics gets almost exponentially harder the higher level you become, eventually requiring years of dedicated training. Leveling up certain statistics also makes training harder, because of that it is advised you train your stats before using level up points.

* Statistics can be increased to superhuman levels and beyond. With enough statistics you can run faster than an Olympian, lift more than a world class lifter, be more charismatic than a politician or become smarter than Einstein etc.

* No one else can gain experience even if they kill things with you.

**Skill Subpower:**

* Almost all actions you do can be turned into skills. Every skill has a level from 1 to 100, based on how skilled you are at the subject. Level 1 is pure beginner while level 100 is pure perfection. Some skills may begin at higher than level 1 based on past experience.

* Skills improve based on your actions. If you wash dishes your dish washing skill will go up, if you read your reading skill will go up etc. The more you do an action and the more focus and effort you put in the faster your skill level will increase. Though some things will limit your growth, if you just read books about using a gun your shooting skill won't increase very much, or at all.

* Skills do not magically give you knowledge, instead a skill level is more of a marker of your skill. You can comprehend and adapt much more than the normal human and because of that skills advance rapidly at the start. Skills still peter off though, until each level takes a long time, similar to the way normal humans learn.

* Skills do not directly increase your abilities. For instance by practicing with a sword you will gain the sword mastery skill, but that skill will not directly increase your damage. Instead you will become better with the sword and be able to hit harder targets.

* You can advance past human levels of understanding and skill given enough effort and practice. You might seem superhuman to others but that is not the case. A person with level 100 running runs fast not because his skill level makes him stronger but because he is perfect. A person in great shape with level 100 running will be able to outrun Usain Bolt because he has perfect form, focus, muscle control etc. If he had 100 running and was fat he would still lose.

* Some skills have requirements and require other skills. To learn the running skill you must first walk, to learn a sword move you must know how to handle a sword, etc.

* In many ways your only skill is your ability to learn very fast in many different categories and be able to adapt. This does not make you more intelligent unless you train your mind to think more logically etc. It does however mean that you are much more perceptive. Skills you half-ass will advance faster than normal humans putting in all their effort. You can train your mind and body to seem superhuman but once again you are not, you are simply more perfect than others.

**TL;DR: Just think of stuff and I'll tell you if it's against the rules.**

  ```
  Step 1) Level up my munchkining skill level to 100

  Step 2) ???

  Step 3) Profit!
  ```

- u/PL_TOC:
  ```
  You should simplify by having gamer's body. Whatever that entails. The details like bleeding (while reminiscent of a cool game like Snake Eater) are niggling and detract from the awesomeness of the central conceit.
  ```

- u/m0le:
  ```
  1) Get a job in a slaughterhouse, ideally for cattle or other large animals
  2) Use the XP to level int and charisma
  3) Genetically engineer hugely strong, extremely tasty animals
  4) Kill animals for infinite XP (engineering bigger / tougher animals as required) and set up a world dominating fast food chain (using charisma to mitigate the GM aspect of my food source).
  ```

  ```
  How are you doing with your story, *Wanderlust*? It sounds like a brilliant idea and I literally can not guess what will happen next. You did a great job on setting up a huge world for your characters to play around in.
