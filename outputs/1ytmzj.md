  In case you dropped this fic and haven't looked back. I took a while to update but it did.

  EDIT: How do I add both url in title and a text post below title? I have seen it happen.

  Another EDIT: Not my fic in case it wasn't obvious

  Ah, I [do run an RSS feed](http://feephome.no-ip.org/~feep/rss_proxy.cgi?9311012) :-) It was broken just now, but I think I fixed it. So that's why I didn't show the update (sorry everybody who uses it).
