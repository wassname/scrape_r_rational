  erraticerrata said that " Archerâ€™s people are inspired from parts of the Indian subcontinent, yeah. "

  does anyone have a list of all the civs and their inspirations ?

    It's interesting given India was never really known to be super bloodthirsty the way Archer's people are described - it's the birthplace of Buddhism and non-violent protest. 

    I think another commenter mentioned Central America and that seems to make more sense to me.
