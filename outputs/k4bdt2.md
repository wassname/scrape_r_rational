  This chapter was really hard to read. The sheer level of callous cruelty Paragon showed, Max's helplessness in the face of it all... it kind of turned my stomach. This one hit me a lot harder than Grace's interlude despite the similar content, and I think it's because Max's torture was so much more... impersonal? Dehumanizing? Objectifying? I'm not sure what the right word is, but it's the way that Grace was still fundamentally a living being whereas Max was basically a piece of furniture. Grace's captors hated her, they viewed her as an animal, as vermin, as a parasite. Max's captors didn't really think about her at all. Grace, despite the torture, is still capable of making her own decisions, her thoughts are her own, she still has meaningful interactions with people, and she's ultimately responsible for her own escape. Max loses all volition, is denied the ability to speak, is never spoken to, loses her mind, loses her *name*, escapes because of someone else's actions, and still isn't even sure she's made it out.

  To try and lighten the mood a little bit, I want to focus on something else in the chapter that caught my attention.

  > “I dreamed,” said Max, leaning forward.  “That you fiddled with the wrong things, and woke up something more intelligent and cruel than you ever could have imagined.”  She lowered her voice to just above a whisper.  “I fled.  And I watched the void swallow all of you.”  Max clenched a fist. 

  I want to know what the hell this is about. There have been occasional hints of some weird shit happening in the background (the lack of stars, Tasia's sister's ill-fated expedition, everything about the ocean, etc.) but this feels a lot more pointed and more immediately relevant. Is this talking about what happened at Buttercup Lodge after Max was freed of the compulsions? If so, it might have something to do with the freaky pit that they use to execute people, since that seems the most obvious culprit. If it *is* related to the pit, that could signal some much bigger issues. Compare the description of the pit:

  > The nurse led her up a stone staircase, and over a bridge spanning a river.  Beneath the bridge, the river became a rushing waterfall, pouring into the massive pit at the center of the island, thousands of feet deep and hundreds of feet wide.
  > 
  > A pitch-black pool sat at the bottom, and despite all the crashing water, none of it made a sound.  The river, the waterfall, the pool at the bottom, all dead silent, an oppressive stillness that engulfed it in a cloud.

  To this bit from chapter 5-C:
  > My eyes stared at the silhouette of the fountain.  I leaned to the side, looking at it from another angle.  *It’s not a silhouette.*  It was a real fountain, but the water trickling through it was so black, so dark that it looked two-dimensional.  The liquid devoured every speck of light that touched it.
  > 
  > It was like a hole cut out of reality.
  > 
  > “That water,” said Kahlin.  “Was taken from twenty-one thousand feet below sea level.  Far below the maximum legal depth.”

  If there's something in the water at Buttercup Lodge, it's probably in the whole goddamn ocean, and that's terrifying. Granted, that's a lot of speculation on my part, but I still want to keep my eye on this.

  The notion of the two separate realities reminds me strongly of Isaac Brin's false memories, supposedly implanted within him - was that just another symptom of some broader phenomenon? Are people occasionally switching between/getting shunted across two parallel worlds? Or maybe there's some pith-created sub-reality that people subconsciously access?

  Regardless, absolutely chilling stuff. Brilliant work. One of the moments that made me most kind of horrified/disturbed is when Max chooses to braid buttercups into her hair.

  Also, there was a whale named Clement in her room and in the therapy room? Was that intentional/a clue?

  Oh man, what they did to Maxime and those kids was just...cruel is too little a word. Paragon deserves everything it has coming.

  I am curious who the guy who got free is. Were we supposed to know him?
  ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Oh my god, the bit with the green circle was just perfect.

  The higher ups at Paragon *knew* who was coming for them and why.
  ```

- u/Gedusa:
  ```
  I have a theory about the seeming two reality thing, based on the description of the Conduit in this chapter and on the green circle at the end:

  >A conduit is when two souls bond close to each other, and merge, partially.  They form a link, that can stretch any distance.  With it, they can share thoughts...

  The two "realities" are two separate souls in different bodies, both of which think they're Max. When they each dream, they exchange information subconsciously. Someone (Paragon?) has Free Max feeding information back to them via Buttercup Max so they can remain informed about the revolution.

  In this theory, Max would be being released for a purpose, which would neatly explain why the boy in the cell opposite could free her - he was in on Paragon(?)'s plan.

  In general I think we're leading up to a Bioshock style "Would you kindly" reveal.

    I'm pretty sure her version of the Lodge is wiped off the map.

    If nothing else, they would have had to erase it when she escaped before she could expose it.

  Oh shit, so this is a V For Vendetta type situation with more mind-fuckery.

  The body/mind horror of this chapter was excellently done.

  I'm still a little confused about the economics and status of swappable bodies. It seems odd that hers should be the first, but also the "best" or highest cachet. We know there are non Maxwell Clive bodies that episotocrats like to show off, are they all made by the same process? It just strikes me as odd that her model should still be in esteem/demand, either its fundamentally superior to the other bodies, in ways we haven't seen and don't have textual support for, or they used the tech breakthrough of making her to create variant bodies, either with or without the soulfuckery. If they have been able to make other variants of equivalent, if not superior quality, it seems like her body would be out of fashion by now, by virtue of it being old and somewhat ubiquitous at the outset before there were variants available.
  ```

    I thought the Maxine Clive models were considered "old-fashioned". Her line of models is frequently referred to as 'vintage'. I think the quality of a body might have to do with the quality of the body from which it was derived from; the man noted the fact that she walked away from a car crash.
    ```

      Some quotes that lead to my impression:
      >         "It’s an Elizabeth Cranbrook.  A new design. Not as classic or popular as the Maxine Clive line, but it’s all the rage with the young Epistocrats these days.  Muscles and skin woven from spider silk. Pink Ivory bones. And over three hundred billion neurons of spare space. You could fit three different people’s worth of Pith inside this brain"
      >         
      >         "As usual, the Admiral was inhabiting a Maxine Clive, clothed in the dark blue uniform of the Principality Navy.  An old classic: the same model as the very first fabricated body, all sweeping blonde hair and milky-white skin."
      >         
      >         " A lovely Maxine Clive.” I snorted. “She could work for a century, and she wouldn't have enough for that brand.”"
      >         
      >         "If you do really well, I'll loan you a Maxine Clive. I look after my own.” "
      >         
      >         "Lorne's maybe, with that vintage Maxine Clive chassis Ana told us about. Ana could swap, and we could run before they catch us.”"
      >         
      >         "Rowyna shouted some inspirational speech from her blonde Maxine Clive chassis, another decadent symbol of wealth. " 

       My point was, the chasis and the underlying tech and the social ramifications can sensibly relate to the story in a number of ways but its not clear (to me at least) which way they puzzle fits together. 

      The first quote is from the first chapter and possibly been slightly retconned, but my point is that its seems like there's fundamentally better bodies, its odd to me at least the Clive body would have maintained its cachet unless it had some fundamental advantages, in either use or production,  or it was rare enough to be a status symbol, but none of those seem true. Like a 40 year old Ferrari is cool, but that's because there's a limited number of them and they can't make more of that kind, there's been no note of distinction for Maxine Cline model years. 

      Are Maxine Cline bodies more expensive, because they're still the best, they could increase the material science but they never found another soul as simpatico with the transfer process? And all others are lesser knockoffs? Can they fold the material science advances into the Maxine Clive line?
      ```

      - u/AcceptableBook:
        ```
        Those are good questions. I want to add another to the pile

        What factors affect the usefulness of a body? Like, is it just raw strength? Toughness? Flexibility? As we've seen, projectors seem to be less constrained by the characteristics of their body than would appear on first glance. Either they can project their body through a Joining vocation, or they can use a different type of vocation to prevent getting hit and to do damage in return. Plus, ABDs are a thing. Even if bullets are a concern, I'm not sure that "Muscles and skin woven from spider silk." would help much with the sort of weaponry that is brought into most fights. It's possible that familiarity might be a factor that trumps all others.
