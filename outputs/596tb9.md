Marked for Death is a play-by-post RPG-style story set in a rational reimagining of the world of the Naruto manga and anime, where all participants vote to control the actions of a single player character - part of a ragtag group of missing-nin, exiles who have come together to help each other survive against everything the world can throw at them.

The story updates every Thursday (u/Velorien of [Lighting Up the Dark](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9311012/1/Lighting-Up-the-Dark)) and Sunday (u/eaglejarl (of [Team Anko](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11087425/1/Team-Anko), [2 Year Emperor](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3xe9fn/ffrt_the_two_year_emperor_is_back_and_free/) and [Induction](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3294457/give_aways/Induction/chapter_001.html)). Drop by and join us in a world where death lurks around every corner, and where anything is possible for those with the cunning and determination of a true ninja.

    You did manage to squeeze in a commendable amount of authorial trolling.
