## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Has anyone else here read Lord of the Mysteries, and what's your opinion of it? It's the biggest hit on r/noveltranslations, and it's well deserved. Translations can be rough at times, but it's a fascinating series, surprisingly good for a Chinese web novel.

  The characters seem pretty rational, the MC always uses divination to check for danger, thinks over the problems and scenarios, and always prepares for everything. He's never too rash either, and avoids clear traps and uncertain situations. It's especially impressive in a mystical world like in LotM, where evil gods, mysticism, and other hidden existences are common.

  The worldbuilding and setting of this novel is pretty unique among all the ones I've read so far. It takes place in an industrial revolution-esque world with heavy Cthulu mythos and SCP inspirations. There are mystical elements in the form of the 22 pathways, each with their own Sequence powers, like Seers with learning and twisting Fate, Lawyers distorting laws and Order, Spectators that can influence the mind domain and control imagination, Sailors that control the sea, and so much more.

  I've almost finished the novel, and it is amazing. The fights are all really creative and make use of all the abilities really well, which is especially impressive when there are abilities where an opponent can steal someone's destiny, distort order(for instance, you can grab someone 45 meters away and physically grab them by distorting the distance from 45 meters to be 45 centimeters), turn into a wraith and teleport from one reflective surface to another, and so much more. All the abilities and Sequences are concretely laid out and there is relatively little bullshit in their definitions and power scaling.

  It's almost certainly the best mystical novel I've read, it excellently uses these elements and incorporates them into the novel. When the powerful figures like Kings of Angels, the Creator, and those even stronger are revealed, their influence and the fear they generate is palpable. You really understand why there are sayings like "Do not look at "Him" directly," or why it's a bad idea to randomly summon or pray to these entities, or even *knowing* of them.

  The writing is surprisingly good as well. I'm terrible at writing reviews and explaining things, but the author can write great emotional moments, emphasize the horror of mysticism, make every character feel meaningful, and truly make the novel feel alive. I was especially amazed by his writing in [Chapter 1335](https://wuxiaworld.site/novel/lord-of-the-mysteries-novel/chapter-1335), "I".

  The horror and mystical elements are perfect. It really captures the horror and fear of SCP and the Cthulhu mythos. For instance, there's 0-05, a Sealed Artifact that's a quill. Anything feasible it writes will happen. Say the owner is surrounded and about to be killed. He could write "A strange and friendly spirit world creature appeared and helped him escape", and it could happen. You can basically control the actions of anyone around you and lead them to certain results without them ever knowing. It's truly fearsome and deadly in the hands of a foe. Not to mention the fact that it can write autonomously and will seek to kill it's owner through writing, and the fact that knowing of 0-05 will cause it to know of you as well. Or a Die of Probability that will randomly roll itself every hour, and the result will determine your luck. Even if you're a god, you could die on a peaceful day if you get a 1! Worse, leave it unsealed long enough and it will gradually grow in strength until it can affect the luck and fate of every living creature. 

  I'd expound on the Cthulhu Mythos influences, but they're all major plot reveals that deservedly earned and revealed, but rest assured they are incredibly impactful, both for the characters and the readers. The villains and antagonists are suitably terrifying. From the birth of an evil god's son, the descent of evil gods, Kings of Angels and true deities, they are all intelligent, mystical, and terrifying. One of the later antagonists is a guy that can create errors in things and steal just about everything. He can steal your destiny, and everyone you know wouldn't notice that you're gone and treat him as if he was you. He could steal the day and turn the night dark, and then bring out the day again during the night, or steal the distance between one place and another and instantly arrive there. He always has a monocle on his right eye, and it's incredibly terrifying, for both the characters and the reader, to wonder if that person, that corpse, or that animal could suddenly put on a monocle and turn into him right in front of you.

  I think this sub would really enjoy Lord of the Mysteries, so if you haven't read it, I'd recommend it. And if you have read it, what are your opinions of it?

    I've just finished reading Lord of the Mysteries today and I'd say it's definitely up there in my greatest of all-time list along with Mother of Learning, Legend of Sun Knight, and maybe Ballad of the Desert.

    What I like about the novel: the story progression, world-building, and character development. What I don't like about it is the quality of the translations, the sometimes unnecessary complexity, and the uneven overall pacing.

    Regarding the world-building, after finishing Book 1, the Author said that he still has some unreleased characters, >!(e.g. the whole member of Aurora Order from Mr B to Mr Z.!< He said that not all characters he created would come to play.  Their purpose was just to make the world’s background and structure grander and more realistic. 

    Regarding the pacing, >!the first few volumes, the main character power progression is relatively slow. Maybe he levelled up one sequence a volume. But the pace is really picked up near the end of book one where he suddenly goes from sequence 2 to 1, then suddenly having an apotheosis ritual to become sequence 0, and even trying to accommodate uniqueness to be above the sequences and become Lord of the Mysteries in less than 300 chapters. !<The weird thing is, I feel like the fast pace doesn't seem to be forced.

    For those who have read the story (or doesn't mind spoiler) and would like to find more about the novel, I suggest reading the english translation of an interview with the novel Author [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LordofTheMysteries/comments/h8tm5y/we_interviewed_the_og_lord_of_the_mysteries/).
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      From what I have heard regarding the >!fast pacing near the ending, the author said he couldn’t take it slowly since that would compromise the intelligence of the main villains, and he’d rather have them competent than to have more chapters. Makes sense, devious and old monsters wouldn’t just let potential threats power up to their level in peace, which is why Klein is constantly in danger. The pacing does still feel way too fast, and the powers and abilities at the end could use a lot more explanations.!<

      The effort Cuttlefish put into the novel is phenomenal in terms of worldbuilding, it’s a complete and detailed world, so much so that a lot of things are left out so it wouldn’t clutter the novel, like the other members of the Aurora Order and the details of the other major countries, similar to Will Wight’s writing process in Cradle where he keeps the volumes short for brevity and to cut off the chaff, but he still has a complete and detailed world and lore, which can be seen with all the lore tidbits he gives out in his occasional answers. Speaking of left out worldbuilding, LotM2 will supposedly take place in a different country, focusing on a different Pathway, Hunter, so it should add more to this wonderful world.

      But yeah, for such a great story you can really feel how the translation barrier lowers its quality.
      ```

  - u/fassina2:
    ```
    It was recommended here often, now it seems to have stopped a bit, not everyone is happy with the ending AFAIK.. 

    &#x200B;

    I gave it a shot but the translated nature and transphobia accusations that were brought up made me lose any interest I had. Later I saw people complaining about the ending which just reaffirmed my decision to drop it.
    ```

    - u/Zysek:
      ```
      I won't say your reasons for dropping it are invalid, as any reason is good enough, but I will say that the transphobia accusations are a touch overblown by certain "too sensible" parties. 

      I'm trying to say this as delicately as I can and it's certainly true that I, not being trans, can probably not fully grasp how damaging certain attitudes can be, but I think that taking a character's views of something happening in the story shouldn't necessarily compel a cancel culture reaction.

      Mild spoilers ahead.

      >!One of the pathways turns everyone using it into women at a certain sequence (there's also one that does the same but to men instead). This is seen by Klein as something he would never wish to do and weird in general, but that is one character's opinion and is perhaps influenced by the fact that the next sequence up requires one to basically control people through sex as a women (and the ones further up are unambiguously evil things like spreading plagues).!<

      >!There is one true transgender character that we see in any detail, and she indeed uses this sequence to become a real woman. She is a pawn of another character and her fate is pretty grim but she is not bashed for being what she is (that I noticed anyway).!<

      On the issue of this being a translation, that is indeed the case and you notice it, but I'll say that the pacing from book 2 onwards draws you in enough that you actually stop noticing it (except when he uses strange words like lampoon). For what it's worth, this is one of the best (non-published) translations out there. 

      On the ending, I'll only say that the last volume was rushed and it shows, but the author does plant the seeds for the breakneck pace for entire volumes. A slower pacing would be completely unbelievable considering what is going on in universe. Part of what makes LotM great is that the enemies are allowed to be as smart (or more) as the protagonist, and they will cheat and lie to stay ahead. 

      In a world where magic power is a strict pyramid (with each sequence being one pyramid), the number of places at the the top is limited by design and unseating someone is much harder than being the first to reach the throne.
      ```

      - u/FunkyFunker:
        ```
        Maybe it isn't relevant for this story, but I wouldn't call it a cancel culture reaction to skip a story if people say it's somewhat transphobic. The situation is less like boycotting an actor for unethical behaviour and more like avoiding a random restaurant because you heard a rumour the waiters are rude. You might as well just go to a different restaurant instead of risking something minor spoiling a nice experience.

    ```
    Is it posted anywhere with a reasonable text size, or is there an epub available?  The text is far, far too large for me to read comfortably on my phone, as it feels like I am constantly scrolling.
    ```

    - u/Zysek:
      ```
      I did read it on my kindle as it's far too long to read on a normal display, so I made an ePub version and I can edit it here tomorrow if I remember.

      If you have access to a computer and prefer doing it yourself, you only need to install this extension (works on both a Chrome and Firefox): [WebToEpub | Github](https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub) Though I recommend you actually use the web store for your browser if you are not too sure how to install from source.

      Then just go to some page where they have the full novel, like this one: [Lord of the Mysteries | Novelfull.com](https://novelfull.com/lord-of-the-mysteries.html). Just make sure you see the index starting at Chapter 1 (else you'll need to reorder chapters and it's a pain) and click the WebToEpub extension on your browser. Then all that is needed is to click download and wait.

      Edit: Download ePub with the entire novel: [Lord of the Mysteries ePub | FileDropper](http://www.filedropper.com/lordofthemysteries-cuttlefishthatlovesdiving)

      Firefox has a reader mode that works pretty well on most websites, where you can change text size, font, and color. Don't know if it'll work on that site though.

    How long is It compared to other novels recommended here? I kinda want to read, but 1300 chapters is scary.
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      Very very rough estimate, but it felt like it was around twice as long as all the currently released Cradle books. Perhaps a bit longer than that.
      ```

  Went with this to the previous thread, but looks like it was too late and it wasn’t all that active anymore. Reposting just in case:

  I’m probably missing a comprehensive advise thread on the same subject somewhere in there, but do you know any books or series similar to Mother of Learning - not necessarily in the sense of making magic just a technology that doesn’t work in real life, but in its mood?

  I’m not sure what exactly I’m talking about; maybe it’s the gradual and thorough establishing of obstacles and well-founded overcoming of them, maybe it’s more the general optimistic view on problems, one that acknowledges the existence of the insurmountable ones but leads the story‘s conflict to hinging on the solution of the more mundane ones. Or maybe it’s just the cinical person’s coming to terms with other people having just as complex and valid motives as themselves. How would you describe that?
  ```

  - u/loveleis:
    ```
    In general, I think that what you are describing is somewhat of a feature of webnovels in general. Because of the more episodic nature, the structure very often tends to follow the resolution of small problem to small problem, with a grander story behind it all.

    So I don't know how many webnovels you have read, but I would advise you to look the best rated ones on Royal Road (their search system is quite good btw, recommend filtering for number of pages / rating / genre)
    ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Yeah, my request is probably more about development of Zorian’s personality and an unambiguously happy ending for unambiguously good-natured characters.
      ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    The first light novel of HakoMari / The Empty Box and Zeroth Maria. Has it all- loops, a love of the ordinary, and reconciliation despite insurmountable problems. Can be bloody.
    ```

  - u/Izeinwinter:
    ```
    Lois Mcmaster Bujold. In particular the Penric & Desdemona series, but really, any of her series work.
    ```

    - u/CaramilkThief:
      ```
      Exactly what I was gonna say. The Curse of Chalion also fulfills most of OP's criteria. There's a general optimism about the problem, even if the situations that arise can be and *are* terrible. The conflict has ties to the biggest beings in the world, but in the end it hinges on the more mundane problems. Cazaril is perhaps one of the kindest, and most unambiguously good, main character I've ever seen. Highly recommend.
      ```

    - u/Zayits:
      ```
      Thanks, will try starting this weekend!
      ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    The story is somewhat controversial in this subreddit, but imo Ar'Kendrythist absolutely fits. The problems the protagonist faces are almost always big and world-encompassing, but there is still focus and development given to solving the mundane problems. There are chapters that focus on Erick's community involvement, from farming to baking to finances. The big problems aren't taken care of through mundane means, but more often than not the reasons for the big problems are really human ones. And in the end, the story never quite loses the wonder at magic. It never turns into just another source of personal power.

  Last week someone linked [Rational Reads](http://rationalreads.com/), a recommendation engine for the sorts of stories this community likes. It looks like it would be a great resource, but it's a few years outdated and needs some attention. So that's my recommendation - go add some works you like and your ratings to that site. It only took me about 15 minutes to go through the entire archive rating everything I've read, and I found a few stories I'm interested in on the way.
  ```

  - u/cjet79:
    ```
    I emailed the original author.

    He sold it to someone, and that person hasn't really done anything with the website in the few years he has had it.

    The original author is now reaching out to the new owner because at least two people have reached out to him.

    All of that is just to say, hopefully it can have some open source contributions soon as well.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Neat! Open source contributions would be nice.

      The site really could use HTTPS.

      I also think the prior on its Bayesian ranking feels like it's too strong. Depending on if it knows when individual ratings were submitted, it could even be upgraded to a Kalman Filter to take into account the potential for drift in the community's tastes.

      It'd also be good to be able to edit works and/or vote on edits, but I'm not volunteering for that, that's a total chore.
      ```

  I recently played [Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game/). It's a game where you're a goose who has to bully people. There's no real plot to speak of, it's really short, and the controls aren't anything to speak about. However, it's also the most fun game I've ever played. I would highly recommend this game, especially if you  want to entertain kids or anyone else who isn't a "gamer."
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Goose Game is about understanding your environment and the people in it, and using experimentation to achieve your goals. There, I justified it in the context of the community.

    (I've been playing Kaizo Mario hacks, which I do not have a rational justification for. Would still recommend to anyone who enjoys hard things. Quickie World 2 was particularly good, both in terms of quality and as a starter.)

  - u/callmesalticidae:

    If you enjoyed Untitled Goose Game, then you might enjoy [Donut County](https://store.steampowered.com/app/702670/Donut_County/), which has a similar "be a terrible goblin to people" aesthetic.

    I've found most of my favorites by complete and utter chance, and seen them recommended basically nowhere since. Anime is more a medium than a genre, and with that size come difficulties to coordinate for ratings and such. It doesn't help that the stigma it still carries makes it so only the most popular series, the ones that have already pierced the barrier, get recommended.

    I'll rec Mugen no Ryvius, though it's kind of old and it shows.
    ```

    I get reccomendations from people who's taste I agree with on other things. So eg if I'm chatting with someone and our opinions match on a few animes we have in common I'll take recs from them on further stuff to watch.

    On which note, what animes have you liked so far?

        A few obvious ones:

        From the New World =>The Promised Neverland (somewhat similar premise/tone)

        Psycho Pass => Madoka Magica, Fate Zero (same author)

        Katanagatari => Monogatari (same author)

        KlK:  Gurren Lagann (same studio)

        HxH => Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood (similar tone and focus on a large cast)

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    [AniDB](https://anidb.net/) has been consistently useful although I tend to read the reviews and check the "similar anime" rather than scores. Also the front page for the currently popular, and for recommendations per decade, etc. The last minor masterpiece I saw was Chivalry of a Failed Knight, though the awkward fanservice made me cringe too much.
    ```

  - u/Yuridyssey:
    ```
    Starting an ep is probably one of the most effective ways to gauge quality. Most bad series reveal themselves pretty quickly.

    If you like a particular director/writer/etc. check out their other stuff. If you get familiar with the source material pipeline, any new anime based on a manga/LN/VN won't surprise you because you'll have been aware of it for years beforehand.
    ```

- u/OnlyEvonix:
  ```
  Diamond dogs by Alastair Reynolds is interesting. It's certainly not rationalist, it's about irrational behavior. It's about how people will fight tooth and nail for the chance to destroy themselves piece by piece for no apparent reward. Superficially it seems to have an anti-transhuman message I'd sooner compare it to some of those documentaries about doping in the Olympics. I also rather like it's descriptions and ideas.

  ```

  - u/Redditor76394:
    ```
    This is absolutely only personal opinion, but I *loved* Twig, and thought it was the best out of all of Wilderbo's finished works. Sylvester, the main character of Twig, is easily my favorite character of all time.
    ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    Seconding Twig. Pact has a fascinating setting, but also a lot of pacing problems. I loved Ward but doing it back to back with Worm feels like a mistake (also would consider listening to We've Got Worm in the interim). Pale isn't done. Twig has a unique, very Wildbow setting, more nuanced characterization, and, more than the rest of his works, knows how to slow down.

    I'd also suggest maybe not reading multiple Wildbow works in a row, he can be a bit exhausting. Maybe Mother Of Learning or Unsong. They're on the fluffier end for well-regarded web serials.
    ```

    - u/D0TheMath:
      ```
      Thanks. Seems pretty unanimous that I should read Twig next.

      > I'd also suggest maybe not reading multiple Wildbow works in a row

      I read Worm like 2 years ago, so I think I’m good.
