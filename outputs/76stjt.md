  I don't think the chapter is as bad as the author thinks. Admittedly it starts out a little shaky but the interesting viewpoint more than makes up for it.

  Most of all I'm just glad it's back!

  It's an unfortunate aspect of capitalism, that as technology advances, instead of everyone being better off, everyone is *less in demand* - and those who had the least resources and skills to begin with, those who were already at subsistence level, will be hardest hit, least able to adapt.

    That why I'm voting for forming The Polity next election.  All hail our benevolent AI overlords!

      You solve FAI, I'll vote :).

        I solve world problems by: A. earning lots of money. B. Donating to people smarter than me trying to solve them.

          Hi, I would like to apply to this position

          How this work, iq test?

          I like free money and would love to work for this innovative new political policy

            ```
            Found and develop a charity organization to the point where you can reliably expect considerable donations.

  - u/monkyyy0:
    ```
    Its an unfortunate part of any thing with meritocracy-like effects.

    Its not like this would go away if you removed money or strong markets. This would be the effect if an omni-present ai judged everyones work and cut off the bottom X% form resources better used elsewhere.
