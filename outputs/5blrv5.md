  Aww yeah, the image works. Thanks a lot, Pixelz! 

  Also, the version on [fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12213213/5/The-Need-to-Become-Stronger) is now up to date. The fanction.net version also includes snarky author's notes - not sure if I should also include those on the website. 

  Anyway, I'm very curious to hear what you all think about the chapter, and the story so far!

    Haha, you're updating on fanfiction.net just as I figure out wordpress has an automatic RSS feed function.

    Oh well; if you care, here's the feed address:

  So I suggested on the other thread to add "prev/next" thing on top of text in addition to bottom, so we don't have to scroll down.

  I have another suggestion though. You don't seem to have a table of contents. Yea, the stuff on home page is adequate now, but if you'll have hundreds of chapters, it's really not.
