  Oh shit.

  Edit: To be a bit more specific, I think having Orochimaru's feet and voice be the only part of him that show up makes for a great villainous debut. He makes so much sense as *The Enemy* that I'm afraid you're bluffing; he's powerful, evil, charismatic, and has the *ambition* that's required of someone who has managed to bring the village to its knees twice in as many decades. No other big-bad candidate has managed to make me think that they are both capable and motivated enough to actually be The Enemy. 

  I think you've done a great job raising the emotional stakes and giving us something a bit more meaty to chew on. Maybe he is the Enemy, maybe he's not, but I'm definitely a lot more invested in figuring out who exactly it is after the invasion arc.

  Edit 2- Orochimaru's imparting some great wisdom here: "If you underestimated your opponent, it only means she managed to outwit you."

    Cheers! Yeah, I really wanted to give Oro a proper villain entrance, in line with how utterly terrifying he was when he was first introduced to us in canon. Part of what made him so frightening there was that he came out of nowhere and you literally had no idea who this guy was. So to fit with that, here he a gets a whole 3 (!) paragraphs of description before he says anything, and even then you can only see his feet.

    So yes, this scene was mostly the result of my realisation that in order to get readers speculating, you have to speak to their imagination and imply things without ever stating them out loud. Characters have to \*feel\* like they have the narrative weight to be the villain, rather than there just being a logical reason for it, in order for the reader to take the possibility seriously. Which of course is tricky in rational fiction, since potential villains have a very strong incentive to not sound like bad guys, but fortunately Orochimaru just doesn't care :P

    You're right about Orochimaru being a good candidate for The Enemy. And of course, unlike in canon, in TNTBS you don't need the Sharingan to be able control Tailed Beasts, you just need the right kind of Genjutsu.

  I love this depiction of Orochumaru.

  I might have commented this on one of these posts before, but I always felt that, of all the Naruto villains, Orochimaru (and Danzo) was one of the most rational. He lived in a world where biology truly was, hands down, the most important science- where the right combination of genes could grant literal godlike abilities, and specialized organs could be more powerful than any technology - and he actually took advantage of that. More than anything he is the actual self-made man of the setting, only instead of other clanless ninja who sat around lamenting about their lack of bloodlines, he decided to use his intelligence to essentially give himself a bloodline. 

  This depiction of him as, even at this 'early' stage, already a vaguely transhuman being, with inhuman servants, is perfection. Its everything I ever wanted from a depiction of Orochimaru, and more. The fact that this Sakura might already start looking into the darker side of medical jutsu (something her canon counterpart never did) is enough to already start making her my favorite character. 

  Normally authors decide to maintain the Sakura-Tsunade relationship, but I do think Orochimaru-Sakura works even better. He's just as medical as Tsunade after all, and much better suited to be a mentor/foil of a rational protagonist. Plus I would find a Naruto-Tsunade mentorship kind of interesting, if she was free as a teacher. A Naruto that can boost his self-regenerative powers , and can mass produce super-strength clones, would be awesome.

  Though, does he have Kyuubi-healing in this fic? I can't remember it being mentioned. If not, it would be pretty interesting and novel if his legendary canon healing powers were something he has to actively work towards, and would give a pretty good meta reason for him to study for a bit under Tsunade. 

  Plus, as you can probably tell, I'm very interested in biology (both in real life and Naruto) and the idea of this fic doubling down on the medical/biological aspect of the Naruto universe is a prospect I find incredibly exciting.

  Also I'm the guy that wrote about how Naruto didn't seem that smart in the beginning of this fic, because of how you had Sakura be the source of his insights in the Haku fight. However reading this chapter, and Sakura's arc in general, makes it a lot more clear what you were trying to do with the Naruto-Haku fight. I think what you've done with Naruto and Sakura's relationship is actually one of the best takes on the duo I've read in a long time, and the way they both learn from each other actually kind of makes me want it to be Sakura who ends up Naruto's rival, instead of Sasuke. 

  I especially like the way you write they think, and how they fight. They're both so similar, and yet so different. Their approaches to battle are interesting to compare and contrast; both are analytical and creative, but Sakura tends to use her smarts to figure out clever, yet conventional ways to win, while Naruto often opts to go for completely out-of-the-box solutions. I never thought I'd say this about any fic, ever, but a Naruto vs. Sakura grudge match to the finish, seen from both their perspectives, sounds like it would actually be a pretty awesome read, and is basically 70% of the reason I want it to be Sakura, instead of Sasuke, who becomes Orochimaru's apprentice.

  If you've done Naruto and Sakura this well, I can't wait to see what you do with Sasuke!

    Thanks for the long reply! Yep, you mentioned something along those lines before, but that's fine because you're helping cement my own ideas and plans for Orochimaru. :)

    With regards to biology... I'm afraid I'm somewhat limited by my own poor grades in the subject there. I always do my research of course, but it's hard to do extreme munchkinry on a subject without being an expert myself.

    I was actually really helped by having my own 'Sakura' who force-fed me science during my youth, just like Naruto's Sakura did in this story. That's pretty much where their characterisation comes from, so I'm glad you like their relationship! The other reason why I went in this direction was because the very first decent Naruto story I read was Time and Again, wherein (spoilers!) Naruto gets kidnapped by Orochimaru instead of Sasuke. I really like those kinds of twists where you take key plotpoints from canon and give them an entirely different twist. So seeing how Sasuke and Naruto had already been done, in this story I wanted to make it Sakura :)

    And of course, Sakura is horrifically underused in canon, so I really wanted to show how to do a character like hers properly. Lots of other fanfictions tried to 'fix' Sakura by just making her 'one of the boys', but this is dumb because I've always thought that you don't \*have\* to be like everyone else to be strong. Canon Sakura wasn't weak because she couldn't punch things hard enough (as Kishi seemed to believe), she was weak because she lacked agency and she wasn't important to the plot. The author could have easily made her a civilian without any training to justify her weakness, and then still have made her smart and interesting and important. Instead, when he finally did give her agency, it was just so she could create more problems for the MC to solve -\_-'

    So yes, Sakura being captured by Orochimaru provides an excellent way to develop her as a character, without turning her into just another dumb bruiser. And aside from her practical abilities, she always did have that violent side to her that was really just used as a joke in canon, but which I always thought would have made for a great potential character arc. So in NTBS, it's what attracts Orochimaru to her and sets her on a new path.

    Also, at risk of bragging too much about my own foreshadowing, I just want to highlight the difference in Shikamaru's fight versus Sakura's. Shikamaru loses his fight because he never learned from his flaws, and dismissed Naruto whenever he brought them up:

    >The  slouching Nara clan heir looked just as disinterested as ever, but  Naruto was starting to think it was more than just boredom that made him  that way. “But then, haven’t you ever wondered… didn’t you ever think  about finding a way to fix all of that? I mean, what’s even the point of  having brains if you don’t *do* anything with them?”  
    >  
    >Shikamaru glanced back at him. “What have *you* done about any of it?”  
    >  
    >“Me? That’s  not… I mean, I’ve done a lot of things,” he protested, but Shikamaru was  already heading up the stairs again, and Naruto had to hurry to catch  up. *What have I been doing all these years, exactly?*

    And again, when Naruto starts his jutsu-sharing scheme:

    >“Seriously?  That’s your excuse?” Naruto clenched his fists. “Shikamaru, you’re too  smart not to realize what’s at stake here. This fake peace isn’t gonna  last forever, and we need to be prepared for when it ends. You’re just  pretending not to understand because you don’t wanna put in the extra  effort.”  
    >  
    >“Yeah, you  figured me out.” He turned to Ino. “Are we about done here? We still  have our own team training to attend to, plus whatever it is you guys do  together. Dissecting frogs or whatever.”

    Contrast this with Sakura, who originally derides Naruto like everyone else, but does eventually come around to seeing her flaws. She is shocked when she finds out how much she enjoys violence, talks to her teacher about it (like a sane person), Kakashi chastises her about the way she treats Naruto relative to Sasuke, she resolves to treat Naruto better, and as she results she actually ends up listening to his advice and learns the chakra-strings technique which ends up saving her life (not to mention heeding his warnings about Kabuto).

    I really enjoy writing that kind of theme into my stories, where the fate of characters ultimately depends on whether they are able to overcome their primary flaw (hence the title of the story), but at the same time it can also be frustrating. You see, Naruto's primary flaw is that he can't get anyone to listen to him because he is too stubborn to adapt to the unfairness of the world, but my intention was always for the reader to realize that this does not make him *wrong.* It was supposed to be a rational lesson in understanding the difference between *seeming smart* and *being smart,* where Naruto is just really bad at the former. Instead, I think the lesson was kind of lost on a lot of people, and the way I wrote it he just came off as kind of whiny.

    Of course, the advantage of publicizing this chapter by chapter is that I can learn from the feedback, so hopefully I can still correct this and make Naruto the kind of awesome protagonist he deserves to be :)

    &#x200B;

    Edit: Oh, and to answer your question: Yes, Naruto does have healing factor, but only if he draws upon Kurama's chakra, which he adamantly refuses to do:

    >***“Hurry,  child. Your time is running short. Undo the seal on your stomach, and  let my restorative chakra flow freely with yours. I may still be able to  heal your wounds, but we must act swiftly.”***  
    >  
    >Naruto  looked up at the being of living fire, the flames seeming to dance and  flicker before his eyes. It looked smaller than he remembered, and  weaker – appearing almost frail in spite of its vast power. “Kyūbi? How…  how come you’re talking to me? I thought Jiraiya had to undo the seal  for that to happen.”  
    >  
    >***“All  techniques require chakra to function, and this one draws upon your  own. As your power fades, so does the seal’s – but there’s no time to  consider. If you lose consciousness again, I do not think I could still  restore you. Hurry and suppress the chakra flowing through your stomach,  before it is too late.”***

    I can't upvote this post enough.  A better explanation of Orochi I have not seen, and I am in total agreement.  And the thought of Sakura being his apprentice and learning it all and teaching him new techniques is downright **terrifying**.

  Awesome chapter! I know we've barely seen anything of your Orochimaru, but i already love him.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:

    Thanks! He's going to be a lot of fun to write, I think. I always saw him as this ridiculously over the top stereotypical villain in canon, and those are always a ton of fun. Rational fiction kind of seems to disdain those types of villains I think, and to be fair canon Orochimaru had basically no motivation (I think Sasuke even called him out on that before he killed him), but there's a reason they're a classic. :)

      I also like your Sakura, particularly because you seem to have created a setting where her main advantage (perfect chakra control) is actually comparable to what others get.   

      In canon Naruto, perfect chakra control means nothing if others can access absurdly broken techniques due to their bloodlines or demons inserted at birth, while you're stuck using academy techniques, albeit with maximum efficiency.  

      The way Jutsu work in NTBS (as I understand it), perfect chakra control should theoretically let you learn any technique? Which is partly demonstrated when Sakura approximates Ino's mind control Jutsu.  

      Since perfect chakra control lets you mold chakra any way you wish - therefore giving you the ability to perform any Jutsu's mental component - all Sakura needs is to learn a Jutsu's physical component and she should be good to go with practice.  Am I right?  

      If I am, Orochimaru also seems like the perfect tutor, since he is the most focused on Jutsu research/exploration out of the Sannin, at least in canon.
      ```

      - u/Sophronius:
        ```
        Yeah, Sakura is definitely a lot stronger than in canon, since unlike the others she can actually get away with inventing new tricks on the fly. Just like Shikamaru's ability to think up strategies mid-combat is justified in NTBS by his use of a forbidden technique that accelerates his thoughts, Sakura was able to create a makeshift sensing technique versus Kabuto only because she has shown the ability to learn new skills on the first try. With someone like Sasuke that would never work, because unlike her he still needed a couple tries to get e.g. tree climbing to work. The difference between succeeding the first time and the second is actually huge, in this case.

        And it makes sense that she has this strength, because let's be honest, why else would the Konoha leadership put some random nobody on a team with the Last Uchiha and the Junchuriki? They clearly saw \*something\* in her.

        It doesn't let her learn any technique, though. Her chakra control is the result of her ability to hyperfocus, which gives her incredible fine control when it comes to physically manipulating chakra, but it doesn't actually help with the mental or psychological aspect. Someone like Sasuke is attuned to destructive elements like fire and lightning as well as darkness because it fits his personality, while Naruto can use wind and light for the same reason. In other words, Sakura excels at areas where she only has to manipulate chakra in its purest form as is the case with medical ninjutsu and genjutsu, but with nature manipulation she is still limited to using water right now.

  I instinctively recoiled away from the idea of considering Orochimaru being The Enemy. Then I reread it three times and realized it was my own bias from reading canon and wanting to know where the story is going while feeling clever because of my meta knowledge. 

  I think this perfectly encapsulated the feeling the Naruto author tried to get across when first introducing Orochimaru. He HAS charisma, whether in this story it is chakra induced or not, he got all those people to follow him to his own village. He got the Sand to betray Konoha. But this is the first time Ive seen his charisma, other than Chiaroscuro and Team Anko, properly done.

  As always your action scenes leave me breathless. How do you go about writing them? The foreshadowing to the lamp was gorgeous.

  Your characterization has been shining brighter than a diamond.
  ```

  - u/Sophronius:
    ```
    Thank you! That's some glowing praise right there. :)

    I want to say that action scenes come naturally to me, but that's not quite true. I actually spent a ton of time preparing them, but I enjoy it so much it doesn't feel like work to me. Basically, what I do is:

    1. Write down the abilities of each of the combatants. Decide on why they are fighting in the first place
    2. Get a feel for the 'style' of each character. How can I make their personalities shine through?
    3. How would these abilities match up? What's the first thing I would do? How would it be countered?
    4. Repeat step 3) until I reach an equilibrium strategy that cannot easily be improved on.
    5. Does this strategy result in a fun fight? If not, adjust the environment/circumstances and go back to step 3.
    6. Play fast action music, write to that pace, and try to fit in as much awesome stuff as possible.

    The biggest challenge is that the characters have to be rational, and so I end up going through endless loops where I ask "what if the other guy does X", and I ask myself what I would do to counter that, and then I have the first person ask themselves what they would do to beat *that*, and so on. And like I said, it still needs to be fun \*and\* it has to further the plot, plus I have to develop the characters along the way. So the whole thing is like a huge optimization problem. But the actual writing process is super fun, and so it's not rare for it to turn out that what I end up writing is quite different from what I originally planned. :)

  Great chapter! Loved Sakura's fight, and Orochimaru's introduction.

  I wonder what was up with Ino. Someone, probably Orochimaru or an ally or subordinate of his, is interfering with the Yamanaka mind-transmission technique, in a way that according to Ino is impossible even if they were somehow reading her mind. The only possibility I see is that her mind is being controlled rather than read. Perhaps suggestions were implanted in all Yamanaka minds in the past so that if their technique was being blocked they would try certain frequencies in a certain order, making it easy to appear to be predicting them. Or perhaps the Yamanaka (or Ino at least) are being controlled \*right now\*. Ino definitely seems like she's being influenced into being irrationally driven to solve the interference problem.

  And of course this links back to Naruto's belief that if you were a shinobi with a powerful mind control jutsu and dubious ethics, the first thing you should do is use it to control everyone with a mind control technique, including the famous clan of mind controllers.

  So yeah, everything points to Oro being The Enemy. Except of course that from a meta, literary point of view, if everything points to something it's probably false. But since this is rational story Sophronius could be subverting that expectation. Grrr. :)
  ```

    Very nice speculation! Of course I can't tell you whether you're on point or not, but I'll record your predictions for posterity and reward you rationality points if any part of what you said turns out to be correct :)

    What I can tell you though, is that the identity of the main villain is meant to be a rational, solvable riddle, and though it's very hard for me to judge how obvious some things are you're certainly not meant to rely on meta-level knowledge. One of the main themes of the story is 'cleverness will get you killed', so 'it's too obvious that this person is the enemy therefore it can't be them' type logic is right out :P

    That said, this chapter came out right after I decided to make some of the possible suspects more obvious in order to get speculation going, so our dear friend Oro might be getting a bit of a suspiciousness boost as a result of that.

    &#x200B;

    Edit: Ok, I'll give one hint, just to keep the speculation going. I can tell you that the Mind Transmission block is one of several lesser mysteries which I designed to already be more or less solvable at this point, and if you figure them out it should provide a pretty big clue as to what's \*really\* going on w.r.t. the main plot and the true Enemy.

    I think a big part of the reason why there isn't that much speculation about the main plot yet is because I overestimated how easy the sub-plots were to solve, and without them there really isn't much to go on. Right now, the only plot that has been correctly figured out on this subreddit is that Sasuke has been secretly reading Naruto's mind, and that by itself really doesn't tell you enough to figure out the rest.
