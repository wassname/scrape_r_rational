## [RT][RST]So do you guys remember than unhypothetical Hypothetical?

### Post:

(I'll be posting an out-of-character post in the comment section. I'll respond in-character to posts made to the thread, and out of character to posts made on that comment.)

[For context](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/471681/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d09gnb3)

In the end, it's turned out to be a hypothetical after all. What happened? Well, the long and short of it is that, since initially posting my request for help:

* we determined it had something to do with ferromagnets
* we determined it had something to do with either static electricity or electromagnetism
* we determined that he didn't have an effect on the objects, it was actually a factor of where they were placed in the room.

And most recently,

* we determined it was happening at sunset and sunrise

And we've come to a final explanation: my contact (honestly, at this point I could just tell you his name, but I've gotten used to this) owns some solar panels that have their actuators turn on according to the NOAA predictions of sunrise and sunset for his area. He hadn't previously noticed this was happening at sunrise and sunset because his blinds had been closed and windows later blocked by tinfoil, to prevent other people from figuring out what he was doing.

That's it. Nothing supernatural, just computer controlled panels and probably some funky wiring. Of course, that doesn't explain the fact that only iron objects exhibit the effect, that the magnetism is so far reaching, and how exactly the dust is affected, but he's emailed some people from the university of michigan who should be taking readings within the week.

We're both a little humbled by how our confirmation biases and own desires to see something "supernatural" got in the way of doing good science. But hey, we'll probably learn some interesting things about the nature of our world, and at least we get the distinction of having done the initial research.

Much thanks to everyone who helped us out, including, but not limited to,

  Alright, out of character, this was a what I'm calling a "trial run" for an interactive event I plan to run, wherein "I" (that is to say, a throwaway account run by me) discover some form of "magic" and provide "evidence" (read: meh quality photoshops) and reach out to the community for help figuring it out, while also relaying a hopefully compelling story about trying to test out magic without letting other people onto the secret.

  A lot of the details would be changing, notably that I would be posting as myself, and that magic actually *would* be discovered, as well as various other major or minor details, but the general idea of reaching out to an internet community for help with discerning the supernatural will stay the same.

  I've already identified some issues with this trial run-- a lack of evidence, being unnecessarily cagey, not deciding what evidence I'd have on hand in advance, and having an underwhelming (and under-explained) "magic," and I hope to correct those if and when I get the real thing going.

  Some fun facts about this trial:

  * I had initially intended for the magic to be real. I decided to switch for a variety of reasons, most notably that people made good arguments that it was really unlikely this was magic.
  * The location of the unnamed experimenter was initially significant-- there used to be a big, open-pit iron mine near his town (Negaunee, MI) but I decided to drop that element when I decided to switch to it not being a magical phenomena after all, leaving it something of a red herring.
  * The whole "only affects iron" thing is a relic of that.
  * I had intended for it to only work during sunrise and sunset from the beginning, however.
  * Initially, I wasn't going to characterize the experimenter at all. It was pretty fun making him into a paranoid optimist, though.

  If you have any advice, please post it in response to this post, rather than directly on the thread, so I can keep track of what to reply to in and out of character.

    Your post reads like fiction.  You're trying too hard to sound casual, and it ends up reading like a poorly written monologue breaking the fourth wall.

    Of particular note was the repetition of "... because, hey, ..." as well as:

    > Not a hypothetical. Or at least, not exactly.

    Building suspense - a story telling technique, not something used when you're laying out facts for assistance brainstorming.

    > The long and short of it is that I got in contact with someone who has what I'd hesitantly characterize as "magic." (At least until we study it some more.) I won't get into *why* I believe them, but I do.

    The italics are unnecessary, and reads to me like you're trying to emulate authors who also overuse italicized emphasis of dialog.  Also, the purpose of this sentence is to purportedly sum up all the information someone would need to advise you; you don't do that.  You keep teasing.  As a reader I get the feeling you're desperate for me to keep reading.  Your organization is too contrived for me to consider you simply don't know how to start the story, and even if that were true, you'd have probably deleted the first few drafts anyway.

    On a separate note, the initial concept strains belief.  Why would you openly expose magic to the internet?  If your true purpose is to get ideas, it'd be so much easier to convince - or let people believe - that you're playing around, not actually serious.  

    In fact, I think that would even make for a nice climax.  If the story is told through a series of forum posts, then, some time after the thread dies or the original poster has been reliably engaging with the forum, show a post where a person mentions a bizarre event profiled on the evening news, and how reminiscent it is of the thread topic.  As to where to go from there, options abound.

    Hopefully this was helpful.

      Thanks a lot for your input, I'll definitely keep it in mind. I'm glad you didn't decide to sugarcoat anything; it's a bit of a blow to my ego, but one I definitely needed.

    Ooh cool that actually sounds pretty fun. Keep in mind however that even if you hadn't warned us ahead of time, it would be very difficult to convince most of us if we didn't actually see the evidence you were making up first hand. If you want our characters to be as rational as we are, then you'll encounter the same issue of people just not believing your character.

    Of course, maybe the only reason you're making this activity is because you actually did discover magic and you want to get our advice even if we don't believe you, and making it into a roleplaying activity would make your attempts to get advice more believable...LOL.

    Try getting some other people into it. Like, if you can convince some of the well-respected rational fic writers to be your confederates and at the right times, you might have been able to actually make some people (or at least their characters) wonder just a little. But you would have to make it believable, otherwise everyone else's characters would know it was obviously a prank.

      I would have presumed it was a prank/hoax corroboration until I had seen some actual evidence. Realizing this made me a little happy. I've previously been bamboozled by motivated credulity regarding a small community I've since nearly forgotten about. Please don't ask.

      See, I first created a hypothetical thread about magic, then said it wasn't hypothetical, then said it was really all the setup for a story (which will result in me referring to this event as potentially real after all) but that I'll also claim is hypothetical.

      At this point, I'm in so deep I could give anime supervillains conniptions :)

    So the whole thing was a kind of role-playing game?

    Neat.

    Also, *really* neat, speaking as mod, that our community remained sufficiently scientific and skeptical to pin you down on its not actually being magic.
    ```

  - u/xamueljones:

    This was a lot of fun and I was partly convinced by the end that this was a scientific thing that was actually happening. It was due to how matter-of-fact you were about your responses when a lot of people role-playing tend to get a little...hammy. Of course, that failed when you realized an error and had to break character to correct it (next time just incorporate it into your act, mistakes happen in scientific testing as well).

    Looking back, I would suggest thinking of possible questions and preparing answers ahead of time so you can have a more self-consistent story. I also noticed that you focused on parts of my question which lead to the correct answer and sort of ignored false trails. I didn't notice this at the time, so props to you for some subtle rail-roading, but when you ignored my suggestion for your friend to play around with magnets (not even a 'nothing unusual there'?) I could tell that you really wanted me to focus on the timing of the events more.

    I'll definitely participate in any 'experiments' you conduct in the future! ;)

    BTW were you /u/iwillmakeyouthink2? This felt a bit like the Grimoire experiments we did before.

    Also I demand a meaningless Internet cookie for coming up with the magnetism and the sunrise/sunset thing!

      Thanks man. I'll definitely be taking your advice about thinking of possible questions beforehand. I actually completely forgot about the "magnet" question in writing the rest of the response. I would have said something about "testing that in a few days" if I had noticed.

      >BTW were you /u/iwillmakeyouthink2? This felt a bit like the Grimoire experiments we did before.

      I can neither confirm nor deny that. (Okay, I can totally deny that, because I have no clue who that is.)

      >Also I demand a meaningless Internet cookie for coming up with the magnetism and the sunrise/sunset thing!

      Don't worry, when I inevitably take over the world with the unhypotherical hypothetical unhypothetical hypothetical magic, I'll make sure to assimilate you before your loved ones.

      In all serious, how would you like to be the "first corroborator" if/when I ever get around to implementing the real version of this? The suggestion to have other people corroborate that magic works seems like a good one.
