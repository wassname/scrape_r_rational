  I love Fine Structure. It goes over a lot of the implications of superheros, has smart characters trying to figure out a puzzle, and features many cool things. Fine Structure was sort of bolted together from a lot of different short stories, and you can sometimes tell, but it's overall pretty great.

  Edit: Man, I've been rereading this, and I'd firstly forgotten how much it jumps around, but secondly forgotten how awesome it is. The story [](#s "spans the whole of human history and this massive war between two entities, and all the fluff and crap and filler has been taken out, leaving only the cool stuff"). The asynchronous storytelling works really well here, though I suppose I'd like a definitive guide to when all this takes place. Maybe I'll write one if I can't find one.

    Oh god though, let me just say thought that when I read *Marooned*, one of the plausibly canonical deleted chapters in the Appendices â€“ oh gosh. [](#s "I was pleasantly blown away by the twist ending in *Science Fiction Future*, and then I'm reading what I thought were just notes, when bam! He hits with that, revealing that Xio was actually behind a huge number of events in the story, deviously manipulating the humans for his own long-term benefit above and beyond what anyone expected. Not even Ching knew the extent of it. Brilliant.")

    *Fine Structure* is truly a beautiful story, and I like it a lot lot lot better than *Ra* (though I suppose it's not fair comparing a finished story to an in-progress one). I hope that he does the promised edits before he starts his next project.
