  People on this sub often discuss the idea of rebuilding a modern civilization in a different universe or a timeline or after being sent back in time.

  This book is technically not fiction, but it has the same kind of vibe as "The Martian" and "What If", so I think you guys will like it.

  Also, I've just started reading it, so I don't know how good it is, but it looks really promising.

    Does it handle all the easily accessible fossil fuels being exhausted?

      Yup, great chapter on wood gasifiers, something I didn't know about before. They're awesome and a great example of the neat stuff in the book. They burn wood and output hydrocarbon gas that can run a normal car engine.

  This is my favourite non-fiction book, super interesting. All sorts of neat knowledge in there that leads to a better understanding of the underpinnings and tech tree leading to a modern civilization. Gives insight into all the things that might be necessary to bootstrap an industrial civilization (on Mars say) and all sorts of neat science and history. Highly recommended.

    It tells you how to specifically reboot a post-apocalyptic civilization from scratch.

    It does not tell you how to bootstrap a civilization on Mars or in a medieval society.

  This. Is. The book I've been looking for my whole life!

  I'm really interested in writing something similar to Rebuild Medicine (after the Eschaton), so... thank you for the recommendation!
