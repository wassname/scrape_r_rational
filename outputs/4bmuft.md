  Huh. Just this morning I was thinking of posting this story on the sub. I guess the latest chapter gave everyone a rationalist vibe.

  On the story itself I gotta say it's probably one of the better written ones out there, being able to take a really DnDesque setting and making it believable and characters interesting.

    A rationalist vibe is fitting, given that "Why don't they just shoot him?" is a question that starts many people's journey to rational fics.

  The Empire stands triumphant.

  For twenty years the Dread Empress has ruled over the lands that were once the Kingdom of Callow, but behind the scenes of this dawning golden age threats to the crown are rising. The nobles of the Wasteland, denied the power they crave, weave their plots behind pleasant smiles. In the north the Forever King eyes the ever-expanding borders of the Empire and ponders war. The greatest danger lies to the west, where the First Prince of Procer has finally claimed her throne: her people sundered, she wonders if a crusade might not be the way to secure her reign. Yet none of this matters, for in the heart of the conquered lands the most dangerous man alive sat across an orphan girl and offered her a knife.

  Her name is Catherine Foundling, and she has a plan.

  A Practical Guide to Evil is a YA fantasy novel about a young girl named Catherine Foundling making her way through the world â€“ though, in a departure from the norm, not on the side of the heroes. Is there such a thing as doing bad things for good reasons, or is she just rationalizing her desire for control? Good and Evil are tricky concepts, and the more power you get the blurrier the lines between them become.

  Updates every Wednesday.

  This is one my favorite web series currently.  The first book is done and the we are well into the second.  The writing is excellent and I think /r/rational will really enjoy it.  Additionally, the author has been very consistent with updates without missing a single week, except for a short break between books.

  Just caught up to the latest chapter; really great series! The Name system reminds me of the Fame system in Shadows of the Limelight (which I've already read), but honestly I'm more interested in the underlying question "Can Evil be better than Good"? And its close follow-up "Can it continue being better in the long-run?" 

  I was firmly on the side of Evil until Bard gave her reasoning for why Good needs to win, and now I'm a bit worried that she's right. As one of the comments roughly said, Good at its best is wonderful for everyone, and at its worst is small-minded and dangerously inept. Evil at its best is efficient and orderly, and at its worst is cataclysmic and genocidal. So while the Dread Empire may currently be a better place than "Good" Callow was, this period of stability and relative peace is extremely rare. And when Evil goes bad, it goes VERY bad. 

  Does anyone have other recommendations like this series? Or other empire building, characters-are-not-idiots stuff?

  Is the table of contents broken for everyone else too? No chapters under book 1 and unable to expand it ... Sad times.
  ```

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    It's in the top bar. Here https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/
    ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    To follow up, this is pretty good throughout; looking forward to more chapters. Very malazan feel.

  Does anyone know how could one convert all these chapters to a single mobi file? I want to read it on my kindle, but I don't like creating a mess on it, with one book broken into 40 pieces...

  Edit: nevermind, I found it: http://blog2book.pothi.com/

  Edit #2: damn, it outputs only PDF's it seems...

      This is working wonderfully so far, thank you.
      ```

  - u/Uncaffeinated:
    ```
    If worst comes to worst, you can just scape the pages and convert them with Calibre

    You could also try just doing pdf -> mobi with Calibre
    ```

  ```
  It definitely gets off to a promising start. Seems interesting so far

  ```
  What I want to see is realistic Good Overlord List (not meta like http://www4.ncsu.edu/~rwirish/ ). And A Practical Guide to Good: Do Right Efficiently.
