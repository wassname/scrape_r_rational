  Simole is being oddly helpful to the Librarian here.

  I wonder if that's because she's on the side of the High Father, and has something planned.

  Or maybe that's just what she wants them to think.

    Well remember the high father was simole's pet dragon and companion as a child so she probably has a soft spot.

  Dizzy has become the overly attached girlfriend meme
