So, I've started another web-serial. Wise Blood is a story about an intelligent young boy who suddenly is inducted into a vast extended family of supernatural creatures, having to adapt to his new situation and--most importantly--learn to use it.

First chapter is up, I welcome any critque.

  Not a lot here yet as far as this sub's audience goes I think. You might've been better served with two chapters.

  The minister seems a bit on the nose. The levels of stress we see in the family combined with the economic fault lines present should've already caused it to shatter, at the least. At the most it might be some bones that would've shattered instead.

    Probably a fair opinion regarding the choice to link this at chapter one. If its any comfort, the next is being posted on Friday. 

    One thing I wanted to do with Nick was show the kind of rational mindset grow from seeds, rather than in a lot of rational fics where they kind of start that way?

  I'm really excited for this to progress. You have a gripping writing style.

  In an attempt at constructive criticism, I thought that the opening scene with the drop off needed a few more distinguishing characteristics expressed for each character; we were introduced to three new characters very quickly so I think it would have been a stronger scene with a little more characterization to differentiate for clarity.

  It's a great beginning. You paced the opening really well leading up to the inciting incident. I'm curious and ready for you to show more of the character of Nick.

  I was certainly thrown for a loop with the final sentence, my expectations were that you were building for a slow burn towards the world of the supernatural. I'm looking forward to these characters being thrown in the deep end.

  Out of curiosity, are you predetermining the specific powers of vampires or leaving it more vague in your own mind?

  Edit: seen to scene

    Without too many spoilers, I'd say it's a little of both? I'd worked out most of the big details of vampire biology pretty well in advance, I think that while having stuff planned out is valuble, you should always be open to both changing that plan and be open to new ideas as they come.

  Story has updated! Feel free to keep chatting here, but this new thread is for second chapter spoiler stuff.
