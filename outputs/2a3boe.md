  This was posted on Less Wrong today and I figured it should be posted here as well.

  It's short, a bit bland and I'm sure you could do a lot more with this premise. On the other hand, I'm not sure how interesting this gets if there's multiple chapters of this.

  Reminds me of Asimov. Fairly bland, dialogue-heavy story focused on ideas. Kinda charming, though.

  EDIT: Also, I found the reference to [portias](http://www.dichotomistic.com/mind_readings_spider%20minds.html) in the blurb amusing. Those things are scarily intelligent for being arachnids.

  Wasn't there an early Spider man comic where peter tried to sell his adhesive, but he forgot that it was set to slowly dissolve, so he realized he had to slightly alter the formula before he could sell it...

  Then just never really got around to it like an idiot?

    Yes, because no one has any use for a crazy-strong, biodegradable, short-term adhesive which doesn't discolor materials and is both variably adhesive and very shapeable.
    ```
