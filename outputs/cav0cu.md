  Sasapariller! What's up with this consequence business? I want my characters back, marvel movie style! 

  Seriously though, fun chapter :) nice to see delmutt get upgrades. I wonder if she's smart enough to out-dog the wiltshire dog now.

  Title typo: You want "Millennium". Mille-annus ie thousand years. With one 'n' it's...not a thousand years.

  I'm just catching up on a month of missed chapters, but I had to go back to the comment section of this one to leave kudos. I absolutely loved reading a member of my childhood religion talking about his motivations and beliefs with a transhuman ~~Hornet~~ Delmutt!

  I love the world and the narrative, but it's disappointingly not rational. This example in ch 26, when Sean tries to make it a useful letter is the best one - he's no Harry Potter. Instead of listing his experiences and observations for his smarter partner to analyze, he just jumps to conclusions and states his hypothesis with no darn proof! And this is a chosen and beloved partner of our rationalist hero? I really wanted to skip this part.

  There were other irrational moments in this book, this is just one example.

    It's more munchkin than rational, in that they are operating in a system that runs off of completely different rules, apparently adjudicated by godlike beings at a whim based on a set of vague guidelines.

    It's like they are actually playing pathfinder!
