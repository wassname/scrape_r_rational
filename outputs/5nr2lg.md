## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I got laid off from my job.  This was profoundly, horribly painful for precisely one day, and then I just kinda felt... normal again.

  The projects we were getting were just less and less of a match for my skills, and we'd already lost the *big* project I was originally brought on for in September.  They say they're gonna provide nice references, keep me on health-insurance a few months, and cashing out my PTO/sick days pays me for January.

  The basic plan is to use this first week or two to get my shit more together than it was this past while, and *then* look for a job.  The awkward thing is that I've got two PhD applications in, and at least one of them might seriously actually say yes.  If either does, I'd really like to go, but they obviously won't until mid-Spring.

  So it goes?  Anyone looking for an embedded/systems or machine-learning programmer/engineer in the areas of: Boston, non-insane Anglo countries, or Israel?

    Best of luck with your job search. I'll plug Palantir because they'd pay me referral money, but we don't do any embedded systems, and I think machine learning teams recruit internally. LMK if you wanna chat about it anyway.
    ```

    ```
    out of curiosity, what systems have you done embedded for?
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      An RTOS and some embedded Linux/Android stuff, mostly on custom boards but also on ODroid 64 and sorta-kinda on Minnowboard MAX (IIRC that name correctly).  ARM/Thumb assembly and a whole lot of C.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    Why do you want to move to Israel? I don't think they qualify as not insane.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      I've lived there before, and while it's by no means paradise, nowhere on this planet is.  There are also different kinds of crazy: some that show up in headlines, and some that make daily life extremely difficult.  Israel has shit-tons of the former, and relatively ok amounts of the latter.  It's objectively a lower standard of living than elsewhere, but it also does a lot to pass the "one bad break" test (that is, one stroke of bad luck or one bad life decision stands little chance of ruining your life in a permanent way).

      My wife would definitely prefer an Anglo country.  She'd also prefer not to move at all, and to stay as close as possible to family.

      Overall, if someone can recommend a magic land of sunshine and smiles where there's no crazy suffering at all and nobody even dies, I'm totally open to that, but extremely skeptical of any such thing existing at all ;-).

        The Future (*maybe*). You'll have to buy a ticket with Alcor Express to get there though. >:P

        (This sparks the idea of a world where it's very easy and very cheap to send people into the future. How many people would jump into the future, confident that civilization is going down a desirable path and just impatient to get there, and how many of those people would have to jump into the future before it suddenly went down a *different* path because all the people who would have made it into that sort of world have temporarily vacated it?)

We just wouldn't be able to feel secure being completely dependent on a bubble-driven tech income for our housing, since she's trying to be a teacher.

  Weekly update on my rational pokemon game, including work on the data creation tool Bill's PC. [Handy discussion links and previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing).

  WELL, it’s been a few weeks.  This would be unnecessarily long if I were to list out all of my excuses, so in brief: after Christmas I traveled out-of-state to visit the wife’s family, then got stomach flu, then had to recover from both while getting back into the groove at work.  There’s no real excuse for breaking the combo last week (and the week before, iirc), but here I am.


  Actually, come to think of it, one of the more relevant big distractions I had the last few weeks was the organization of a Pokemon Tabletop United group on the /r/rational Discord server, which had both it’s pros and cons.  Several of us drew up characters and even had a few mock battles, and I have to say, it was very encouraging to see pokemon beating each other up on a grid work so well.  I have unfortunately had to drop participation with it, as I think I only really have the time to spare for *one* pokemon-related time sink, more’s the pity.


  ----


  As part of the work on that group, I drew up some designs for biomes, since that work could be used in both projects.  I eventually decided that spawn areas will basically be determined by precipitation, temperature, and tags (such as types of plant, stone, other environmental factors, etc), with each tag increasing or decreasing the chance that a pokemon will spawn in that area. Map makers will then be able to decide what each biome has (precipitation, temperature, fauna, and maybe some forced species), and world generation will have a few iterations of having each species “decide” whether the map-defined biomes “fit” the pokemon’s generation criteria.  


  That was the bottom-up approach, which I will continue to iterate on as the game’s design progresses.  For the tabletop, such fidelity was of course not needed, so instead I threw together a top-down approach of simply listing pokemon in biomes I thought fit (with lots of help from the #poketop channel).  [That list of the first ~3 generations throughout ~10 biomes is here.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yC4l6iLl_DtWFAZ5rfCp8xPdc6edZK7uRM2d9dM0dYI/edit?usp=sharing)  I will likely be using this as a starting set of guidelines in the future.


  ----


  That aside, my current focus is still to get the feature list completely consolidated.  There are somewhere in the neighborhood of 800 individual features listed in the current feature document, and this is being pulled apart and sorted.  Progress is slower than anticipated, but it’s necessary work and I feel the project will get nowhere without it. 


  The current plan is to divide every feature into subfeatures, try and break those subfeatures down further into four broad-strokes categories, and then number the resulting list, sort them into a feature roadmap, and then treat this as a monolithic to-do list.  


  The four categories are as follows:

  * Systems

  * Entities

  * Mods

  * Content


  An *Entity* is a C# Interface and a handful of variables which define a template for a specific *type* of object.  Basic functionality will no doubt be included, but this is intended to be the most abstract definition of an object class possible. To illustrate: Equipment is an Entity, a type of object that is designed to be used and manipulated by characters in the game.  An Equipment object has a name, a bundle of stats, and some basic functions such as Activate() and CanActivate().  

  Entities in general will be the major limiters of scope for the engine: since these are not loaded dynamically, they will act as anchors, limiting the ultimate reach of any modded content.


  A *Mod* (or *Module*, in this case) is a block of functionality that is attached to Entities.  If Equipment is an Entity, then WearableEquipment is a mod: it offers extensions to the Equipment object, allowing content to be created that “knows” how to be worn, including interfaces for checking if you’re wearing more than one pair of socks or what have you.  Mods can run the gamut from abstract (such as WearableEquipment) to more concrete (a Pokeball mod that adds capturing, scanning, and withdrawing code to any piece of equipment that implements it).  


  As the name suggests, Mods can be customized by the user.  Due to this system, much of the functionality that would normally be completely locked away within the engine will be exposed.  I imagine a certain set of mods being defined as “core” and included with the game, but everything from typing interactions to society simulation to weather to anatomy to aspects of the combat system being a mod (or more accurately, a cluster of related mods) that can be swapped out as needed.  Mods are written in C# and are loaded at run-time and compiled.


  *Content* is a JSON text file describing a game object.  This JSON will list the mods that the object hooks into and defines all of the variables used by the Mod and Entity. An Ultra Ball JSON, for instance, might declare it is a Pokeball and a ThrowableEquipment, define values for Durability, Weight Limit, Weight, and ReleaseSpeed, and probably references to an Ultra Ball sprite or two.  By itself, it does nothing; it is purely data that is read and manipulated by other processes.


  Which brings us to *Systems*, which tie it all together.  The EquipmentSystem, at startup, reads all Content files that define themselves as Equipment, instantiates the appropriate Entities, and loads the appropriate Mods that get attached to the Entities.  It then enforces the rules that uniquely define Equipment in general, while also managing the various Equipment mods as necessary.  


  I’m still working through the ramifications of how multiple Systems will interact with one another, but so far I think this is a solid enough organization.  It’s a bit of work drilling down this far into abstract design; I won’t deny it rankles a bit knowing that I would have a prototype already working if I didn’t care to make it moddable to this extent, but I feel it’s a necessary experiment.  This organization, if it works, is a pattern that I will take with me to other projects, and I’d like for it to succeed.  


  For now, tho, it’s definitely a bit of a pain to take a system as simple as, say, elemental typing, and stripping it down and twisting it to fit within this four-layer paradigm.

  Feel free to leave any comments or questions below. Also feel free to join us [on the #pokengineering channel of the /r/rational Discord server](https://discord.gg/sM99CF3) for brainstorming and discussion.  It’s a great group, really, and I would highly recommend hanging out, even if you’re not in it for this project itself.  There’s tabletop groups, Dota 2 partying, and [puns](http://i.imgur.com/j3jRmMZ.png) like you wouldn’t [believe](http://i.imgur.com/8cUkzoGl.jpg).  Come join us!

  Between the ages of 17 and 21 I did a fair bit of hitchhiking, and a few days ago I touched up a short [guide to hitchhiking](https://nikvetr.wordpress.com/2016/06/02/guide-to-hitchhiking/) I'd written last year.  It won't teach you how to make a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, but it will teach you some of the strategies I'd found effective at getting strangers to drive me around for free. Most of it's commonsensical, but I think I go into a bit more depth than similar guides I've seen scattered across the internet, and it's good sometimes to confirm your suspicions w.r.t the obvious.

  I don't imagine *too* many here would be interested in hitchhiking (or cocktails, for that matter ;]), but I figure knowing how to do it could be at least somewhat useful in a pinch; e.g. if your car runs out of fuel and you need to hitchhike to get more, or you're strapped for cash and need to be somewhere soon-ish, or you're traveling in or to an area with very limited access to public/hired transport, like a remote trailhead or lodge. I also found it helpful in the development of other, important skills, like entertaining + making friends with people very different from myself through conversation, empowering myself to ask for help from others in peculiar social contexts, and accepting rejection and denial with aplomb. Plus, hitchhiking gives you some good stories, and is one of the cheaper ways to travel (depending on your competence, personal assessment of risk, and accounting of opportunity costs).

  To anyone who's interested: As of today, I've finished plotting out all of [Extracted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jPU6QKEohcrw6l6O3SxorIxf2Tnq54h36LtQO6Qv86w/edit) to the level of knowing exactly what I'll be writing; all I've got left to do is to actually write it out. Or, put another way, it's very likely I've broken through my usual failure mode of keeping on writing until I fade away without finishing the actual story.

  (I'm afraid that I won't be adding any narrative today, though; I'm still feeling overly-sleepy after yesterday's blood donation. Prolonged doziness: apparently good for creativity, not so much for execution.)

  I'll be helping lead a group of eclipse hunters out to Wyoming for the solar eclipse this August! As the resident astronomer for a bus full of affluent space enthusiasts, I'll probably be fielding a ton of questions. I'd like to be prepared for them by having encountered and answered them before. 

  Anyone have questions about the Sun-Earth system, eclipses, or astronomy in general they'd like to ask?
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Are you very concerned about the issue of sustainable hunting of eclipses? When is eclipse hunting season, and would you recommend getting a license?
    ```

    - u/Gaboncio:
      ```
      While eclipse hunting may be a fun and fulfilling way to spend your time and money, there are definitely still some issues with the practice. The most pressing one, in my opinion, is the fact that total solar eclipses are bad for solar power. We already know that solar panels leech out some of the Sun's energy, making it burn out quicker, so imagine how much damage the moon can cause! The moon absorbs basically a whole continent's worth of sunlight over the course of a day, and that can lead to massive outages and all of the dangerous consequences of those. 

      Always get a license! Only licensed eclipse hunters can participate in expeditions like this, so be sure to not miss out.
      ```

  - u/captainNematode:
    ```
    I've read that, if there were a bustling extraterrestrial tourist community, the earth would be a pretty hot spot to visit because the proportions and distances between the earth, moon, and sun are fairly unique, enabling hybrid/annular/total solar eclipses. Approximately how unique are they? What proportion of planets have satellites that occasionally obscure parts of their star (I'd guess both orbital planes need to be fairly aligned? Is that common? How often would obstruction happen if they weren't?)? What proportion of those have similarly sized stars and moons, from the perspective of a viewer on the surface of the planet?

    Thanks!
    ```

    - u/Gaboncio:
      ```
      We have to make a couple of assumptions about our alien neighbors, but I think I can make some convincing arguments for you with the data we have. Let's think about what variables change eclipse rates in a system.

      Really, what sets the eclipse rate is the size of the planet's satellite and its host star on its sky, and as you said the alignment of the orbital planes. Those are approximately (for small sky-sizes) set by the ratio of each object's distance and radius. We can look at this distribution pretty easily for exoplanets, thanks to the great, open-source approach of the exoplanets community about their data. Sadly, we haven't really discovered any exomoons, and I doubt we will for a long time, so we'll have to settle for data from our own solar system. 

      Exoplanets.org can plot the distribution for the ratio of orbital distance to stellar radius. For Earth that number is 215, and according to the data they have, only 0.8% of known exoplanets have values between 181 and 220. Already we can tell Earth is pretty rare, and we still haven't thought about the other two factors. 

      I managed to find data for the [16 largest moons in the solar system](http://www.ianridpath.com/moons.htm), including orbital inclinations! By eye, it looks like most moons have a pretty good chance of blocking out the Sun at Earth, and we can see that they mostly orbit around their hosts equators, which is a nice property. But, we have to remember that these are the largest 16 out of over 150 moons in our system. That means that somewhere between 10% and 5% of moons are eclipse-able, depending on what the actual distributions are. So, let's check!

      Assuming these distributions are independent, we can just multiply our probabilities: 0.008 x 0.01 = 0.00008 or 0.008% of exoplanets will have Earth-like eclipses, *if* the satellite distribution in other planetary systems looks the same as it does here. It probably doesn't, and we omitted the fact that *most* large moons in the solar system are not around terrestrial planets, so that number will probably be lower in practice. 

      Thanks for a great question!

  There's a planned [debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5n5els/would_you_like_to_help_debate_with_rcollapse_on/) coming up between /r/Futurology and /r/collapse.

  Anyone have thoughts on what a steelmanned version of the collapse argument (which centers mainly on resource depletion) looks like? I'm mostly interested in the idea of decentralized production for non-collapse-related reasons (it works better in space, for example), but it is sort of relevant since they worry about centralization and bottlenecks and so on.
