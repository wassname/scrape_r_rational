  Masego wtf r u doing 

  it would take a miracle to-

  hmm.

    ```
    To hook up with an Orc?  Yes, I'd say it would

      Genre shift to Battle Harem. Masego certainly fits the Harem Protagonist stereotype in a lot of ways. ;)
      ```

        ```
        Nononononono. Where there's Battle Harem, there's Progress^TM and I'd like this story to end before the heat death of the universe.
        ```

- u/haiku_fornification:
  ```
  The new blood (Juniper, Hierophant) seem a lot more used to chaos  and winging it than the old guard like Ranker. Is it because they aren't tied down to all the legionary structure or because, in some sense, the armies reflect their leader and Cat thrives in disorder a lot more than Black?
  ```

- u/ForgottenToupee:
  ```
  So Warlock is occupied plugging the gate. Black and Squire are busy trying to stop Ubua. Masego is getting his teeth shattered. Archer and Hakram are in the middle of the Undead Legions. 

  Well *fuck*
  ```

  - u/panchoadrenalina:
    ```
    and thief is prepping to **yoink** something somewhere inside the city.
    ```

- u/TheEngineer923:
  ```
  "... Friction is there where there should be none."

  Oh hell, if you can capture an Order Demon, rip out it's aspects and reverse engineer them you can literally become a capital G God. 

  The very first application I thought of was creating a goddamn perpetual motion machine. I mean the reason why that is not possible in our world is because dissipative effects (like friction) dissipate some of the energy placed into a system. So you'll never get 100J of Work for 100J of Heat supplied in most processes you encounter IRL. 

  A Magineer who reversed engineered an Order demon would laugh and flip off such paltry "guidelines".  Superconductors, bullet train carts, high powered artillery shells... the the list goes on. I wonder if those glorified lawn ornaments in the sky employed such a method to gain their technological superiority? 

  And an Order Demon isn't even at the Top of the Demon Hierarchy! By Cthulhu I cannot wait to see how a Tier 1 Demon functions...
  ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    Order demons seem to basically have "editing privileges" on creation, turn various physical laws on and off, etc. By analogy I imagine that the higher level demons have more expanisve abilities like being able to create new things from nothing, or delete them entirely. Then maybe when you get really really high you start being able to change the fundamental laws of the world globally and permanently, not just distort them in certain areas.
    ```

- u/Zayits:
  ```
  Does anyone understand the layout of the battle? Is the remaining central bastion behind the field of undead and the pit in the middle of it? Where exactly are the demons? Are the wights that turned into a formation those in the field or behind the bastions?

  I'm just trying to understand whether Masego's multi-track warding will fuck over the legions or the wights.
  ```

  - u/TideofKhatanga:
    ```
    [It goes roughly like this.](https://i.imgur.com/BPLrAU3.png) The situation was a bit better before the Praesi had the brilliant idea of raising more undead. And yes, the demons were placed specifically so that the legions had to get around them, so the wards breaking is horrible news.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      Nah, Masego is catching an arrow with his teeth, it'll be fine
      ```

- u/Oaden:
  ```
  So bets on what Masego is gonna do? Its obviously insane.
  ```

  - u/nick012000:
    ```
    I think he's going to try to bind them to serve him.
    ```

    - u/rty275:
      ```
      My guess is that he’ll somehow combine their aspects to close the hell portal. It’d be Madness to impose Order to make the portal Apathetic to change.
      ```
