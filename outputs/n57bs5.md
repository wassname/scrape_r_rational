## Self-promotion: Wizard’s Tower z web serial

### Post:

Hi!  I would like to introduce a story I'm working on that I hope will appeal to you.  The story is written in first person and stylistically is slice-of-life.  Meaning that issues aren't always resolved immediately and while there is action, base-building, politics, and more interwoven into the story, it also deals with a lot of the psychological factors impacting the main character.  This isn't your normal hack and slash fantasy novel.

Blurb:

The humans call me Nemon Fargus.  They call me wizard, and [Elementalist] and [Enchanter].  They call me teacher.  They call me adventurer.  
But I don't care.  Not anymore.  For more than a hundred and fifty years I've served the Kingdom of Sena.  Through four Kings and a Queen.  Two wars and a rebellion.  I've founded and taught at a magic school.  I've fought against beast waves and dungeon breaks.
But now?  Now, the one close friend I had left has passed.  So, I'm done with their politics and their economics.  The short and busy lives of humans are more burden than benefit on the weary soul of this half-elf.  Now, I'm looking for a refuge, a place that can well and truly be my own.  Away from the growing cities and the bustling markets, away from the pointless wars, away from the eager students and the arrogant adventurers.  It's too much.  
I'm seeking the peaceful life of a wizard in his tower, studying magic to advance my spellcraft.  We'll see if that happens.

    Absolutely!   

    I actually found this subreddit recently by searching for mentions of my story (as I imagine most authors do to ensure no one is stealing their work) and found that a member here had already recommended it once.

    Then I started reading through the forum and was amazed at so many like-minded folks in one place.  I'm not normally a person who explores reddit, or visits it much, so it makes sense why I hadn't come across it before, but I feel like I fit in already.

    Wizard’s Tower meets four out of five of the requirements in the about section of this /rational,  with the fifth only not being met because the climax of the story (or first arc of the story in this case) hasn't yet been posted.

    The story is told from a first person POV with a heavy emphasis on world building and internal thought processes.  I have tried to subtly (and sometimes blatently) describe those thought processes in a way that demonstrates both his internal conflicts between logic and emotion AND   just how often he lies to himself. 

    The main character is a centuries old half-elf wizard raised in a human kingdom where he has outlived everyone he's known.  He's determined to build a tower in the middle of nowhere to escape the chains of social obligation so that he can focus on creating a longevity spell to remedy that. 

    And, of course, fate conspires against him.  


    If that's not sufficient grounds to convince you that Wizard’s Tower is worth checking out, then I have only one other method I would like to use at this time:  Please?

      I am liking the story so far but I am confused about the [Class] system. So once you level up to 100 you can advanced your class tier and obtain a myriad of benefits. It was talked about how very beneficial that a tier 2 mage picked a third tier geomancer class since they are very useful and not typically held in the front lines. But from what I read so far the magic system is not directly tied with the [Class] system. People can learn different Magic’s not tied to a [Class]. 

      So what are the benefits of a [Class]? Do they even provide skills or it is just a label system from the Elven goddess of knowledge? When someone becomes a [Mage] and learns the ice manipulation skill did they learn it from the [Mage] class granting it or did they read a tome and learned the ice manipulation skill the hard way? Is the [Mage] class simply a label?

      We have seen many different classes such as [Wagoneers], [Logger], [Administrator], [Guard], [Bandit], and [Ranger]. But not once have we seen any of these people with these classes use any skills. If I was a [Wagoneer] pitching my services to a 200 year old grumpy half-elven client I would probably bring up my skills saying I have the [Smooth ride] skill or the like. This leads me to believe that the [Class] system is just highly advanced labler. But, we see the MC use the Analyze skill to people in order to see their class distinction. Was that actually a general class skill or was that a spell learnt from a tome? 

      The only class skill I saw that can’t be explained being a magic spell or learnt from a tome was when the [Paladin] used a truthseeking skill. It was actually the first time we seen a skill being used other than spells slung by mages. But I guess it could be divine magic or a talent from his god since class skills seem to not exist. 

      The MC dives really deep on some philosophical aspects of the class system and even told stories of people endlessly grinding chasing levels. But I don’t see the benefit of people chasing levels. Do you actually get stronger from leveling up by gaining some sort of stat? Maybe leveling up grants your body more capable of intaking ambient mana? Or once again is it just arbitrary?

      I am really enjoying this novel and I hope it expands more on the [Class] system/levels and how the world generally works with it. I hope class skills are actually a thing because it would make more sense that a class system with tiers and levels should provide some sort of benefit other than showing society you are above them. Other than that some of these classes did not have the famous [Brackets] over them in earlier chapters such as [Gardener], [Servant], [Guard], and [Innkeeper]. As a fan of the novel the Wandering Inn, I felt abashed that the Innkeeper did not seem to deserve the [Class] distinction lol.

        Some will be expanded on later, but a lot of the reason it isn't is simply because it isn't important to the mc.  

        As far as bracketing the innkeeper, I did so when I first typed it out, but then I felt bad, lol.   I saw a comment on it in that chapter, so it's added to the radar.

        Thanks for reading!

  I'm quite enjoying the story. Caught up and favorited. 

  I like the slow burn, and the politics are setting up to be interesting. The cantankerous wizard is a great trope and we hardly ever get their perspective. I actually also really like Lilly. She's going to have to deal with the harsh realities of her world at some point. 

  Thanks for the story, and I'll keep reading if you keep writing.

  I’ve enjoyed catching up with this story, subscribed for future updates. 

  My only comment is that despite bad things happening/other people’s manipulation attempts, a lot of the problems have been very easily dealt with. This makes sense for an OP wizard with his experience and history, but it leaves a slightly unscratched itch. Not sure if any of that makes sense, sorry

    I think it's a pretty reasonable reaction to the story so far but I'm pretty sure that there will be some more involved conflict coming soon

  I'm enjoying this story. Looking forward to more updates.

  Read this already. Agree it's both good & suitable.

  I finally caught up to the current chapter I’m really enjoying the story so far. The main character is interesting, the base building is creative, and you have somehow avoided all the things I dislike about LitRPGs on Royalroad so far. 

  I thought the explanation for dungeons was a great touch. Just a few sentences of consistent backstory on why the different game like elements exist makes a huge difference for worldbuilding.

- u/aponty:
  ```
  The most frequent and jarring grammatical error in this rough draft is the sentence fragment.  Such as this one.
  ```

  - u/Allanther:
    ```
    That's actually intentional in a lot of places throughout the draft.  It's something that other authors do, as well as a common recommendation from creative writing places.  

    That being said, if you are still reading it and something is causing you to lose the immersion, I'd like to hear about that in the comments.  

    If you aren't reading it, then I'd like to thank you for taking the time out to try it.

      I'm up to date with the story so far and that's in the top two things that bother me about the fic.
