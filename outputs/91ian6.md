## Question about Worth the Candle. Spoilers

### Post:

So in chapter 94 Amaryllis changes herself through soul magic. I really liked story so far, but this doesn't sit right with me.

So my question is whether this will be seriously addressed later. I don't think I will continue if it doesn't, so I'm fine with being spoiled here.

  It hasn't been yet, though it's bound to come up again sooner or later.

  I wonder, though, why her choosing to no longer be a side-interest for the protagonist is that uncomfortable? It's probably not the *healthiest* manner to address that problem. But who has the right to deny someone agency over their own soul?

    If it were a normal crush I'd agree with you, but Amaryllis was suffering from an arbitrary out-of-character affliction engineered by the DM; the healthy response is to excise it like the foreign agent it is.
    ```

    - u/LordSwedish:
      ```
      What? The DM specifically said he didn't construct them as a harem and that they were just companions with the potential to be love interests. Amaryllis even said that she wasn't attracted to him at first, she thought she would have to become his wife/lover due to lack of power and decided to start thinking about him that way...which unfortunately worked.
      ```

    - u/Shakeq:
      ```
      Can you quote that? The dm said that he chose Mary as a companion. (possible love interest).

        He said he set it up at the start and didn't meddle during the story. Given her reaction to Juniper is so atypical and obviously harmful, I don't think it's reasonable to consider it a natural extension of her normal character.

        > “Is that what you’re telling me?” I asked. “That Amaryllis Penndraig wasn’t set up for me?”
        >
        > “She was,” he replied. “They all were. But they were set up as companions first, and love interests second, and now that they’re out in the real world, so to speak, I’ve been keeping my hands off.”
        ```

          I think it means she lived the sort of life that would make her attracted to someone like Juniper at the beginning of the story- powerful, naive and almost instantly loyal. He was basically Valencia at that point. 

          This whole thing is my favourite twist to the story partly because of reactions like 
          >Given her reaction to Juniper is so atypical and obviously harmful

          which is every bit as amusing as seeing people freak out about their sinking ships. Amaryllis crush was certainly embarrassingly awkward and unpleasant for her but people who cheerfully embrace magical self-castration as a solid alternative prrrobably have an axe to grind.
          ```

    If she just got over it as DM said - it would not be what I hoped, but that's fine with me.

    My problem is how it is done. Violation of self is good wording of how I feel about it. At this point I'm pretty invested with characters and can't just ignore it and read for the general plot.

    Since it is not addressed in remaining 17 chapters I guess I'll wait it out and return with this question in half a year or something.

      I understand your issues--it's a serious and problematic thing to do--but don't you think it's in character for Amaryllis? She's ruthlessly pragmatic in every facet of her life. She saw a problem, assessed her options, and took the one that made the mosy sense to her. 

      And to be fair, Juniper was quite upset when she did it, and they had a big discussion about it that ended (IIRC) with him saying "I still don't like it, but I respect your autonomy and reserve the right to bring this up again if I think of a better argument."

      Do you have a problem with Juniper dialing down his level-up addiction? I'd say that's just as natural a part of his soul as Mary's crush was of hers.

      Also, I feel I should mention that I disagree with your disapproval of self-alteration in general. If I had soul magic you can bet your ass I'd dial up the importance of fitness and accomplishment.

        I'm noticing a weird side effect to doing something like that, I think?

        Like, I play too many games, for too long. So I keep reinforcing the part of my brain that make distractions not feel good.

        So now when I need to be distracted, or otherwise not do The Most Important Thing, I feel like shit.

        So now I'm repeating to myself: Get out of the car. There's no combination of buttons (aka, self-alterations to do) to do it; you just Get Out Of The Car. http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/04/21/universal-love-said-the-cactus-person/

  Juniper questions her over it briefly whilst in the chamber, but I imagine you realized that already.

  Whilst it hasn't necessarily been addressed in the chapters since, I imagine this is one of the things that becomes a slow-burn issue, something that seems immaterial at first but eventually is granted greater importance to the story, before coming to a resolution in some future plotline. Whether the resolution satisfies you or not is another question.

  To answer yours, however, it hasn't yet been seriously addressed, but that doesn't mean it won't be. It's only been 10 or so chapters since the issue came up.

  If you don't mind me asking, why doesn't alteration of one's own soul sit right with you?
  ```

    > If you don't mind me asking, why doesn't alteration of one's own soul sit right with you?

    To start with more emotional than rational view. And as I said In another comment, I'm pretty invested into characters at this point.

    So here I agree with June, that she is altering core part of herself. She says her feeling does not define here, but while they are obviously not all of here, they are important part. To just switch it off does not makes here another person, it makes her different enough for me to see it as being wrong. And this also opens gates to potential further changes, even if they are never used.

    And this is compounded with June being somewhat interested party, so he cant come hard on this issue without looking selfish. This is what probably grates me the most here - not only I don't agree with alterations, but it also can't be properly debated in-world because if conflict of interests.

      Following your reasoning and using the in story arguments:

      How is what Mary is doing to herself any different than what Joon is doing with his level up?

      You can argue that Joon's desire for leveling up is a core part of who he is but he views it as a negative utility and so he chooses to lower its value. Mary does not like that she has feelings for Joon and sees it as negative utility. By changing her romantic values towards Joon she is resolving the problem.

      In terms of abortion, if Mary was carrying hers and Joon's child, she reserves the right to terminate that pregnancy because its her body. She reserves the right to terminate any feelings she has for Joon because its her soul. She thinks that Joon should do the same but she is letting him make that decision for himself.

      Yes, it will make her a different person, but so does anything that anybody does. Carrying baby Solace is altering both her body and soul too but it doesn't seem like you're arguing against that choice.

      Yes, one could argue about the negative slippery slope but that's all hypothetical and the same could be said for it in the positive.

      Even if you see her actions as completely wrong on several levels, why would you stop reading over it. Isn't an important deuteragonist having serious flaws while still being likeable otherwise a pretty normal thing to have in a story?
      ```

- u/Argenteus_CG:
  ```
  It's fine that you don't agree with Mary's decision, but I find it a little odd that you can't continue the story because you disagree with one character's decision. Real people make mistakes, so even if you see self-modification as horrible, it shouldn't ruin the story for you.

  Personally, I see nothing wrong with it. To my knowledge, most of us here are transhumanists, and more often than not transhumanists believe in the right to self-modify. I don't see what she's doing as any different from using antidepressants for depression or anxiolytics for anxiety, just far more controlled. A better solution. How is altering the mind somehow worse when you can do it in a controlled, specific way? I see the right to modify your own mind, be it through drugs or soul magic, as one of the most fundamental rights there is.

  I mean, the story's still in progress, and you've almost caught up to the latest update, so the jury's still kinda out.

  ```
  It's "addressed" in the sense that the narration makes it clear that it really does not sit right with Joon either, and he and Amy fight about it. 

  Ultimately, Joon has to ask Amy and Fenn to forcibly pin him down and alter the value of "Level Up" in his own soul (and the need for this gets increasingly severe, because his desire to level up to the exclusion of all else gets more intense every time he levels up and the higher his level is) although he justifies this by reasoning that the DM is messing with his mind in the first place. For Amy's part, the DM arguably molded her mind for the purpose of crushing on Joon from the very start.

  I wouldn't say it's *resolved* but it is addressed. It's clear that the fiction isn't taking soul changes lightly, at least. That said, if you're not satisfied a few more chapters in, you probably won't be satisfied for the remainder unless it's revisited.

  You're only seeing the situation from Junipers perspective. He's pretty self absorbed, and emotionally isolated, and the fact that the world revolves around him isn't helping matters.
  ```

- u/WalterTFD:
  ```
  I doubt it.  I don't think the author shares your unease with the concept.  I think the bit where AlteredAmaryllis changes back to OriginalFlavor and confirms that she wants this is supposed to allay your concerns.
  ```

  - u/Croktopus:
    ```
    i dont think thats necessarily true. forget about what the author thinks (he hasnt said his thoughts on it and its not super relevant anyways), i think the *story* sees it as kind of an open question. the protagonist is clearly against it, and i did not feel anything approaching closure on the issue. its not even closed for mary, since she wants joon to reciprocate. this is clearly going to come back up
    ```

- u/matematikaadit:
  ```
  I think I've become victim of my own shipping and got *heartbroken* when reading that chapter too. But really, I recommend at least continuing till the end of book V (Chapter 104). That's a good stopping point, I guess. It soften my broken heart at least.
  ```

- u/MilesSand:
  ```
  The most recent chapter is 112 and so far it's at the point of "agree to disagree" but it's sounding like a setup for a subplot sooner rather than later.


  Then again, June is doing the same thing. He's just being a hypocrite about it and since the story is from his perspective, his pov is all we get.

  * both are arguably dm meddling but just as likely the person's natural feelings of the subject 

  * Both characters have been bothered by their affliction since the first few chapters and neither of them has mentioned their concerns to the other 

  One is presented in a way that makes it make sense while the other is presented in a way that makes the reader uncomfortable, but they are both the same action taken for the same reasons. 

  Don't worry though, in the chapters that follow the speaker glosses over the issue like he glosses over his powergaming mindset and the way Mary treated him just slightly differently than others, so you don't have to think about the implications until you want to or the story gets back around to the resolution of those behaviors / events.
