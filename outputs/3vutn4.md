  Nice article.

  > warships using *stealth in space* (hint: infrared emissions, second hint: the background temperature you want to avoid standing out against is 2.73 degrees Kelvin, i.e. liquid Helium temperature)

  One way to do this is to bring a big ice pack with you. When you need to "go dark", you start dumping all your heat into melting the ice pack instead of radiating it. (You're going to need a lot more science than that if you're writing hard sf, but that's the basic idea.)

  As a bonus dramatic device, there is definitely a time limit in how long you can stay dark - eventually you've melted all the ice and have to start radiating again if you don't want to cook yourself. Maybe you'll even have to shut down life support or anti-zombie internal shielding or something to grab a few more minutes of stealth.

  (Mass Effect is the only story I can think of that has used this. The Normandy is a prototype stealth craft, and the design costs of this are *not* handwaved: much of its bulk is taken up by massive lithium heat sinks that can still only barely handle 3 hours of acceleration or a few days of drifting. I found this quite impressive considering it's blockbuster sf that could easily have gotten away with pure Element Zero magic.)

  > Now for a biggie: **Mining the lunar regolith for Helium-3**. This is junk science on stilts and it just keeps coming back from the dead.

  While Stross's argument against He3 mining is well made, note that regular Helium is a non-renewable and rapidly depleting resource on Earth. It's so cheap right now that we put it in baloons, but that's because of an artificially inflated supply (the US mined it excessively for military purposes during the cold war, and are now dumping it on the market) which cannot last. Liquid helium is the best coolant we have, so it's not too implausible that some near future technology will create a high demand for it. There is still room for lunar exploitation in sf stories.

    I'm pretty sure it was used in Stross' *Singularity Sky* and in the later *The Expanse* novels.

    Why not just radiate in all directions except the direction of the enemy?

    One of my very few attempts at writing fiction used an inversion of that idea: an AI eats the Solar System, but keeps shining narrow beams of fake sunlight at nearby stars to pretend that nothing special is happening.

  My personal one us unique to games. 

  I am bothered by plot and game mechanics contradicting each other.

  Or worse outright ignoring each other.

    Characters dying in cutscenes while their Phoenix Down-laden friends all cry about the horror is a classic.

      I actually dislike more stuff like how star craft's zerg are mega adapters with infectious spores that should give them crazy awesome zombie potential in story.

      But mechanics wise the protoss get the actual unit steal ability in brood wars.

      I was a lot more pleased with the mechanics design in star craft 2 for this reason. 

      It's kind of like the equivalent of show don't tell but for games. 

      Don't tell me this race is a slowly dieing breed with vital limited population and a need to depend on me and more robotics, cyborgization to restore fallen warriors and so on. 

      Show me that with your mechanics.

      Other wise I get serious case of dissonance.

        Also don't get me started on the discontinuity of mass effect hand held weapon design and mechanic experience.

        The specs of what their guns do mean that the only thing stopping a pea shooter pistol from hitting like a sniper rifle nuke is the safeties.

  All sorts of shit involving alternate timelines that demonstrates a basic failure to comprehend the magnitude of the butterfly effect.  If two timelines diverge from some point, then statistically, it is with great certainty true that no individuals conceived after the point of divergence will be shared in common between the two timelines.  The odds of the same sperm impregnating the egg are so astronomically small.  Your AU where Rome still runs the modern world shouldn't have Richard Nixon in it?  Frankly, your AU where Woodrow Wilson loses the 1912 election shouldn't have Richard Nixon in it.  The universe is sufficiently probabilistic, and is a sufficiently interconnected system, that data from a potential future is not helpful unless it points out a possibility you were unaware of - your 2015 Gray's Sports Almanac isn't going to help you make bets in 1955 because the fact that you have it means that you're not in the original timeline and all of the games are going to go differently this time.

  **The unexamined bacterial hellscapes involved in imagining we might abandon a wasted, desolate Earth to live on other planets.**

  Earth has a biosphere with the same life chemistry as we have. The proteins and sugars most of its microorganisms produce are compatible with ours, by (at worst) a few degrees remove. We can eat something that eats something that eats them.

  They've all got the same favorite peptides, same favorite amino acids, and are fond of gathering and concentrating the particular rare elements we need to live.

  Though alien life will likely share superficially similar chemistry, the devil's in the details. Any planet with anything more than the simplest of life (which we could probably kill simply by infecting it with ours) would be *unpredictably destructive* to life as we know it. Its microorganisms would figure out how to eat our molecules, without necessarily producing digestible waste products in return. Our bacteria would probably reproduce quickly enough to adapt, and everything less prolific would be at the mercy of both side of that evolving war.

  I invite anybody who has struggled to keep a sample clean in organic chemistry lab to imagine this nightmare on a geologic scale.

  Terraforming a lifeless planet, on the other hand, even in an ideal temperature and pressure regime, is a closely related disaster. How do we control our own microbial life in a new and unregulated environment? The mad and murderous equilibrium of nature, all the myriad checks and balances in the soil and the sea, didn't develop by accident. It sculpted itself, carved by billions of years brutal infighting.

  Even a perfect, carbon-rich atmosphere at the right temperature and with a lot of water, seeded with a friendly mix of plankton and soil bacteria, is (after the centuries that bio-soup would require to take over) rather likely to have evolved into something quite unlike the biosphere we need. But it would be better at surviving there than anything else we could introduce, and better at eating us than a truly alien biosphere.

  Essentially one worse case scenario version of the "planet with its own biosphere" problem.

  tldr: Future Earth - wasted, toxic, post-industrial - is a relatively nice place to live. It would be insane to leave before the sun burns our atmosphere away.

  Heh.  A good part of my motivation to write "Fall of Doc Future" was reaction against a number of these in superhero settings:  Doc's fusion generators are proton-boron, and Flicker, even with her not-quite-perfect magical physics inertial damping, is moving testimony to the power of KE ~ 1/2 mv^2 (approximate because relativity matters at her speeds).
