  It looks like there's a dearth of activity on the past few Friday updates, but Tuesday updates are more lively. Might be weird noise, but if Friday's are really inconvenient for someone then let me know. 

  (I'd also like to confirm that the past couple of updates, including this one, have been easy to make sense of, since it was recently mentioned that this was an issue.)

  (Also: Everyone still enjoying the ride? We're not really at the point where the roller coaster is falling down yet, but I'm trying to make sure that there's a sense of acceleration and "things happening" all the same.)
