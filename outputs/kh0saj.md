  Seeking Power has seen another update, and as always, it combines excellent characterization with rational themes and a compelling story. After the rational fic [The Moon's Apprentice](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/196256/the-moons-apprentice), the author has improved their writing even further. Highly recommend.
