  Read 15 chapters so far.

  I really wouldn't call it rational. Taylor holds big and blatant idiot ball - just to preserve the stations of canon. Fighting Lung alone and joining the Undersiders in situations like this are so non-optimal, the vast majority of worm fanfics try to avoid it these days. And that's not even taking under consideration that Taylor here apparently is superintelligent and mostly clear of bias. In the comments, the author blames Simurgh, Entities mind control and the story "not being a wish-fullfillment fic", whatever that means... 

  I mean, it's not bad, but it's also not really what it advertises at the beginning.

    I had similar issues early on in the story, but I think it gets much better later on. The author actually has a decent explanation for the idiot ball Taylor has early on in the story but it takes a while for it to come up and the foreshadowing/reveal is a bit luckluster. The saving grace of the reveal though is it is totally possible to come up with the reason very early on.

    Honestly the story is more rationalist than rational, especially later on. But there are definitely issues with its execution that I didn't mind too much but YMMV. The author is definitely attempting to write a rational fiction though.

    My recommendation is to keep reading if you don't mind the beginning too much as it definitely gets better later own. I ended up really liking the story but I totally see others not liking it. Especially as someone else mentioned it's tone is a lot like a fix it fic. Things in general sort of work out instead of horribly backfiring.

      Alright. I kept going - I'm on 40 chapter now. 

      The fact that I didn't force myself to do this after being discouraged so much at the beginning should say enough about quality of the fic. 

      It really isn't bad and it keeps getting better, but... It still doesn't seem very "rationalist", you know? Taylor's intelligence doesn't feel like intelligence, more like someone supplying her with answers, or something.

  A bit too fix-fic for me. I'm up to chapter 12, and so far "enhanced intelligence" seems to mean "everything goes well for Taylor". Which is nice for her, but not especially Rational. Maybe it changes later on, but I don't read Worm fanfic to read about things going well.

  This line in particular:

  >While I lacked wisdom, I was sure to pick it up quickly. My principles of humility and forgiveness already served me well.

  is quite ironically funny. If there's one quality this Taylor hasn't demonstrated yet, it's humility.

    As somebody that went further I want to point out that you are reading a biased POV.

    Yes it's a bit fixy, but not so much as the beginning leads people to assume.
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      Noted. How much further should I read to get to the good bit?
      ```

        I haven't a good recollection of it honestly , last time i read it was months ago (i wait for a bunch of updates before going back).

        I think if you're not satisfied by chapter 35 you can definetly drop it.

  (Entire comment of spoilers)

  I agree that it genuinely looks like Taylor's self-modification was always intended to be not that great. I think there are two reasons why this is communicated poorly.

  Reason one is that her weird decisions often lead to her repeating the plot of Worm, rather than going too far off the rails, at least early on. She joins the Undersiders. She wants Brian. She robs a bank. Even if there *is* a reason for her decisions being bad, once readers notice that the author has a specific goal, it will feel like there's an idiot ball.

  The second is that unreliable viewpoint characters are a lot harder to read than they are to write. Check out Umberto Eco's Baudolino. Practically every time the frame narrative appears we are reminded that Baudolino is an untrustworthy source. Frankly it gets repetitive. And yet it's *almost not enough reminders*. Readers will tend to try to believe the viewpoint character unless there are intrusive cues to disbelive.

- u/Draconomial:
  ```
  First by manually manipulating her own brain chemistry, the main character discards her emotional bias to achieve her goals.
  ```

    ```
    This was her first mistake.
