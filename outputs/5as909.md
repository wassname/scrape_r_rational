## [SPOILERS] Doctor Strange is the anti-rational movie (and I hate it)

### Post:

The good guys win at the end, the bad guys lose, the Obi-Wan figure dies, the Earth isn't actually destroyed, and the guy with blood coming out of his eyes is, to everyone's surprise, actually evil. There, I spoiled the movie, now you can read this critique.

I think we can all think of tons of irrational tropes, and movies with tons of those, at the top of our heads. *Doctor Strange* is more than that. *Doctor Strange* is what would happen if you took a director, told them too make the least rational movie possible (which is prooooobably not unrelated to what happened), and then gave them all the special effects. Like, all of them. So, what we have is a gorgeous movie, using 3D to its fullest, and a nice Marvel movie plot with good action and funny jokes... and I sort of hate it.

Let's start with our protagonist, Doctor Stephen Strange. Two years ago (holy shit time flies) our fine Mr Yudkowsky [wrote a guide](http://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing) to writing non-clichÃ©d intelligent characters. Dr Strange feels like someone read this guide, and decided to make a character by doing everything the guide tells you to avoid. The man travels all over the world, spends his every last dollar to find the only organization that has a chance of healing his hands... and blows them off almost immediately when he finds them because he doesn't believe their methods. He knows that they have already cured one guy whose injuries where supposed to be beyond medecine's ability to fix, and yet he instantly dismisses them. I wouldn't have done that, Harry JPEV wouldn't have done that. We would have shut our big mouths, and tried to understand what was going on. Ask at least a few questions before insulting and shoving around the only people in the world who might save our hands.

Doctor Strange is clearly not Level 1 smart. He is Level Hollywood smart: he knows lots of science, he's quirky and arrogant, people call him "Doctor", he learns magic really fast off-screen, so clearly we must infer that he's smart. Except we never see him do anything smart. He uses a forbidden spell without even checking the chapter for potential warnings, he has a chat with the trapped bad guy even though he knows his minions might come back at any time, etc.

Which is really symptomatic of how science is treated in the whole movie: as one of several bags of tricks you can draw from when you feel like it. First you draw from the bag "acupuncture", then the bag "herbal medicine", then the bag "radiography, Hollywood defibrillator and internet connection" (but not "guns", for some reason). You never see anyone using something resembling epistemology the whole movie. Doctor Strange never stops to wonder why he previously thought acupuncture was a pseudo-science, when it apparently gives consistently good results. The moral 'dilemma' between the Ancient One and Evil Guy is essentially a matter of "do you side with the Monks tribe or the Evil ex-monks tribe?", and the characters never wonder "Hmm, I wonder what would be the probable consequences of either decisions", or ask Evil Guy "What makes you think Dormammu is actually going to follow through his promises if you feed him the entire world?". I could go on for a while, but at this point it feels like I'm going through a checklist; basically every irrational trope is in this movie.

In conclusion, I'm kind of waiting for EY to write a witty, absurd, irreverent one-chapter fanfic deconstructing this movie now. :p But REALLY THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST.

EDIT: As comments pointed out, I'm being very mean to a decent Marvel movie. I'm aware of that: this post was mostly me venting out of frustration. Again, the movie is pretty good, with amazing visual effects and okay movie stuff (dialogues/acting/sets/whatever). The writing is still annoys me a bit: it's not dumb by action movie standards, but it feels anti-rational and anti-epistemological in a way that irks me.

  Many of your problems with dr strange come from the fact that his backstory was locked in stone back in 1963. He isn't supposed to be a rational or believable character. He is supposed to represent a complex relationship between ability and hubris.

  He is a talented character, brought low by his hubris. He travels the world, seeking to fix his problem without atoning for his sins. Only when he is truly humble does the world allow him to live up to his real potential. And whenever he becomes overly full of himself, he loses his powers and aids chaos, as a way of the universe punishing him for hubris.

  It's an Aesop's fable. Not a modern, rational piece of fiction.
  ```

    Didn't ever really seem that humble though
    ```

    - u/Terkala:
      ```
      I'm using the definition of the word "to have a low estimate of his personal importance". He doesn't ever think he has no important skills, but his transformation moment comes when he stops thinking of himself as intrinsically "better" than other people. Such as going out of his way to help those most in need, without regarding them as beneath him.

  Personally I liked the movie and while there were some annoying things I mainly thought it was rational enough for a hollywood movie.

  >and blows them off almost immediately when he finds them because he doesn't believe their methods. 

  He came there because it was the only lead he had left and it was the only thing he cared about. He accepts whatever mysticism bullshit they have going on and figures it's a cover for an experimental procedure because the idea that it's actually mysticism is highly unlikely. They then get patronising and start showing him random things (it really should be noted that they never say what parts of acupuncture or whatever work, just that they are based on something that actually does work) and tell him that this guy who had severe nerve damage basically learned to walk with a placebo.

  This is like someone trying to save their company from financial collapse and then their colleague comes in and says they can get a bailout if they squeeze a rubber duck and jump in a circle. Sure, if Strange wasn't so arrogant he probably would have said something like "well can you prove it?" but he would have been expecting them not to.

  Anyway, Swinton shunts his astral body because she's probably used to people having the perfectly logical reaction of disbelieving her and his first thought isn't "oh clearly this proves everything" but instead he assumes he was drugged because that's how these things are typically done. Here is where it's completely proven that magic is actually real and everything he ever knew was a lie and as soon as it happens he accepts it and asks to be taught like a rational person would.

  As for him learning to use magic we skip past him learning all the minutia where he reads thousands of pages learning to focus his mind because the movie would have been awful if that wasn't the case. 

  His character is shown to be arrogant and headstrong time and time again and that's fine because as long as their flaw isn't "stupidity" any flaw can be present in a basically rational character. This is why he just tries out the awesome time manipulation that he just saw because he didn't see any warnings as they come in the end.

  He chats with the guy who was completely trapped because he assumes that the minions would already be back if they could. It turns out that he dropped his gate-maker-thing in the desert without noticing so one of the minions finds it after a while.

  The defib thing was annoying, the "death is good" was annoying, and how they brushed past some of the "you were born for magic" stuff was annoying. With that said, the evil ex-monks, Swinton, and Mordo all had good points as to why the others were untrustworthy or wrong. The ex-monks argument was based on the fact that Swinton had used Dormammu as a power source for centuries and since she keeps everyone else from doing the same thing it calls everything she says about him into question.

  **Overall**, not a rational movie but certainly no less rational than the absolute majority of hollywood movies.

  So... No more dumb than any other big hollywood movie, right?

  - u/LupoCani:

    Actually, it sort of is worse. Glossing over important questions is Hollywood's M.O. There's magic, but no one thinks to ask the implications for technology, physics and science in general? That's a Tuesday over there.

    Strange, however, asks the questions and then proceeds to utterly mess up answering them. Meeting the Ancient One, the typical Hollywood character would have said something about magic not being real, and then been shown magic, and then boggled at how small-minded they were. A rationalist protagonist would have explained how we're made of matter, the idea of a soul is silly, the universe doesn't care, and asked to be proven wrong.

    Strange finds the anti-golden mean. He goes off on a rant about the universe being material and uncaring, just as articulate and sensible as a rationalist, but then proceeds to hold on to this idea religously, relenting only after being mentally thrown across the universe and back.

    The Ancient One wasn't being aloof or myserious, she was perfectly willing to explain slowly and clearly to a modern, thinking, questioning person. It was the perfect setup for a rational story, where the protagonist doesn't have to wade through swamps of dogma and vaguely-described mechanics. The stage was set for an intelligent conversation in way you rarely, if ever see in movies, and he had to barge in there with a caricature of reason instead of the real thing.

    So yes, it is more dumb than most Hollywood movies. Those are just stupid through and through. This one sets the stage perfectly for the rationalist, and then goes out of its way be dumb.
    ```

    - u/tweaker20:
      ```
      I found it totally in character that a desperate, embittered, and hopelessly cynical Strange wouldn't rationally break apart those outlandish ideas, but instead launch straight into a tirade about the uncaring nature of the universe, a worldview which is totally a projection of his own issues and despairs.
      ```

      - u/LupoCani:
        ```
        I never said it was out of character, only that it was actively unpleasant to watch. I suppose you could say that's the point, but when it's unpleasant for reasons the movie proceeds to not care about, I don't think that's very valid.
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          I think you nailed it.

          Dr Strange behaving irrationally in that scene was perfectly consistent with what we'd seen of him so far, but it still annoyed me. Plus, he doesn't actually become more rational after that, he just switches from the "Science" tribe to the "Magic! (with defibrillators and weird wifi passwords)" tribe.
          ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah, this movie has a lot of moments where you feel something clever and sensible is about to happen, then it slaps you in the face and mocks you for expecting it to be smart.

      For instance, in one scene Strange asks the bad guy "If you are really benevolent, why did you kill people?" That was the perfect setup for a brutal utilitarian response, "I'll kill millions of people if it's what I need to destroy Time and Death! They don't matter compared to the billions, the trillions of people I will save!"; instead we get a callback to Dr Strange's earlier nihilism, "I killed them because they don't matter and they're specks of dust in an uncaring universe.", which is really just a convoluted way of saying "I'm evil and and I don't care about killing people" while sneering at utilitarianism.
      ```

      - u/Anderkent:
        ```
        Huh? His line was perfect; it communicated the same notion of a sacrifice of a short life to get everyone else the eternal one; but it did it in a witty way referencing earlier dialogue.

        I think you're reading way too much into those 'setups'. The movie never even attempts to take itself seriously, and the viewer is expected to pick that up. Hell, the first scene where Strange is operating while being quizzed on random songs is explicitly there to set that tone. All those setups to 'rationalist moments' are just setups for gags.
        ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Well, the Captain America movies are mostly okay on that front.

    This movie feels like it's actually trying (pretty hard, I might add) to be dumb. So, slightly dumber than your average big H movie.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      Quote from a FB friend: "Does it bother anyone else that when Captain America dropped that aerobridge, that bridge that gets people from the terminal to the plane, on Spider-Man, he was totally probably killing Spidey? Like, Cap hadn't met Spidey before, and had no idea how strong Spidey was. Like, obviously in a few minutes of fighting you can tell Spidey is several times stronger than the average person. That doesn't mean he'll definitely be able to hold up several tons. He's also a kid. Cap didn't know that. Was he guessing Spidey would dodge? This wasn't a justified true belief.

      Like, there is a different story where Captain America totally just killed a innocent American teenager, superpowers or no, and he is going to prison. This would be a big freaking deal. This has been bugging me for several months."

          Well, I can play devil's advocate for both of those scenes. 

          Cap vs Spidey: Cap is an extremely skilled martial artist and has just sparred against Spidey for a bit, in addition to (possibly) observing him in action for quite a while (e.g. artfully dodging flying cars). Spidey seems to be physically superior to Cap in agility and maybe in strength, if not skill, and Cap would have known that. 

          Thor vs Cap's shield: Why would Thor, a literal alien, be bound by Earthling morals? He's clearly from a warrior culture and has no qualms about killing his enemies in battle. And, he is still holding back both vs Cap and vs Iron Man. If he wanted either of them dead, they'd be dead.
          ```

          - u/MugaSofer:
            ```
            Yeah, given Thor's character arc in *his* film was "maybe genocide is a bad idea", I think merely trying to kill superheroes for opposing him is a pretty big step up.
            ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      I haven't seen Doctor Strange, but the Captain America sequels have a similar weird anti-intellectual bent to what you seem to be describing? 

      I guess they're more *anarchist* than anti-intellectual, with the whole "superheroes can't be bound by law because law might hypothetically conflict with doing the most good" theme, but it's certainly very similar.

  ...beware the temptation of forming an Internet anti-fan club where you all watch things you can hate so that you can hate them together; I wouldn't want /r/rational to turn into that.

  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    ... Does that mean you're *not* going to write a witty rationalist Dr Strange parody? Well now I am sadness.

    But yeah, this is not something I'd do on a regular basis. Dr Strange felt particularly aggravating at time, because the whole Agent Scully "stop taking the plot so seriously and accept that things are magical" theme sometimes felt like the movie was making fun of "me" in a mean way. But even then, I don't actually hate the movie (or only a little). I wouldn't recommend it to people who like rational stories, but I wouldn't think less of someone for liking or anything.

    You should post this exact comment in every single thread on this subreddit. I mean clearly everyone here, including OP, totally thought this movie was aiming to be rational and I heard there's this one guy who thought Harry Potter was meant to be rational and even wrote a whole fanfic filled with subtle (really hard to notice them) criticisms of how irrational it was!

    In fact, there's a whole subreddit dedicated to them and you should probably go tell them how much you enjoyed Harry Potter because they probably didn't know that you did.

          Right, it's not like the OP literally says "But SERIOUSLY THIS MOVIE IS THE WORST.".

            The word "seriously" was a bit of a miscommunication from me (like when people use 'literally' for emphasis). I'm not, like, furious about this movie (once I've taken my pills).

            I think if you're on r/rational for the reasons I am, which may or may not be the case, the irrationality of Dr Strange is going to bother you, which might have an impact on you enjoyment of the movie. I don't know why; I did like Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, so clearly "seriousness" is not the only thing at play, and I feel there's *something* these movies have (or don't have) that's missing in Dr Strange.
            ```

            - u/Anderkent:
              ```
              Right, I'm not in any way saying that your review is out of place. I just feel like having a bit of signal in the comments saying "hey, I also really like rational fiction and it bothers me when a work is irrational and not aware of it, but in this case it didn't bother me because the entire thing is comedic in nature".

              So yeah, I have no problem with your post, and the comment chain here is because I was just weirded out by how what I meant as "this seems to be a YMMV thing, rather than 'unwatchable piece of trash' thing" was apparently offensive enough to warrant a sarcastic takedown by /u/RMcD94.

                I don't think it contributed anything. I thought I made it clear that his comment could easily be copy pasted on every single critical analysis ever

                - u/Anderkent:
                  ```
                  Yes, but it wouldn't be; it would only be copy pasted on those that not everyone agrees with.

          - u/RMcD94:

            - u/Anderkent:
              ```
              But the implied message is "if you're on r/rational, you won't enjoy this movie". Which is what my short comment was trying to address.
              ```

              - u/RMcD94:
                ```
                Yes saying and I hate it clearly means and you will hate it. 

                I think if anything all you could stretch the implied line is that people who would only enjoy rational content wouldn't like it. Which your comment doesn't disagree with, you didn't say it was rational just that you liked it
                ```

                - u/TennisMaster2:
                  ```
                  It was signaling.  "I'm here; I like rational content.  And I liked the movie.  It's okay to like both."  That was the extent of both u/Anderkent's message and intent.

                  If every comment here had been, "This isn't rational.  Negative things," then those who identify strongly with this community (which you shouldn't) would feel some social pressure to also not like or not deem the movie worthy of watching.

                  Their comment was a gentle reminder that it's okay to dissent.

                  __________________________________________

                  As an aside, it's not a good idea to tackle someone who says something you think had no value, or should not have been said.  Everyone will just look at you oddly and not want to talk to you.  

                  If other people smile and give thumbs up instead of ignoring whatever that person said, then that means what that person said had value to the other people around you.  If you disagree, and think they should not value what that person said, again, tackling the person is a bad idea.  Rather, clearly explain why you think what they said was not valuable.  In doing so, open yourself to and in advance consider compelling arguments that would change your mind.  If you're not open to those arguments, then you're trying to fit everyone else in your coin purse and it's really quite stuffy in there so please stop, ow, this hurts, I can't breathe, why are you doing this to us?!

                    All 5 of the top comments are signalling then. 

                    Nor am I interested in this subreddit pandering to people who have Edit: not understood the most basic of rationalists tenets about tribalism, nor do I accept that anything about the rationalist community even remotely fosters the idea that there can only be rationalist content and everything else is terrible. If people feel social pressure due to tribalism to not like the movie then I don't care. I'd rather people stick to discussing the topic than signalling. If there comes a point where no one disagrees with a main topic (ie almost of the big names EY, AW, etc posts) then alright people can literally just signal, but still even then people should look at comment number 5 for examples of how to do that, not any of the other four.

                      Reading 5+ comments that are basically variations of "I disagree with the OP" does sting a bit when you are the OP :p

                      That said, I don't think the several disagreeing comments are out of place. My post was a long and angry message that signaled "DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE". If you think the movie is worth being watched by the people on this subreddit, you might feel that it deserves a strong "this movie is still kinda good" signal, hence the multiple responses.

                      Aside from that, I agree with TennisMaster2: you could have made your point without being confrontational about it. Of course, um, you're free to communicate however you want. But being less aggressive might have helped you drive your point across. :)

  The anti-rational writing intersected perfectly with a complete rejection of Sanderson's Laws to make this movie painful to watch. The rules of magic weren't internally consistent, and even where there were reliable rules, the characters failed at the most basic applications of what they HAD learned.

  Seriously. Why would you RUN around a tilting, tessellating landscape fighting gravity shifts WHEN YOU ARE WEARING AN ITEM THAT ENABLES YOU TO FLY???? One which you have used successfully and apparently instinctively in prior scenes, and which ALSO has independent intelligence and could point out this solution itself? Maybe there's some anti-flying rule in the mirror realm but at no point was that explained or even hinted. Aaaaaaargh.

      Doctor Strangelove is kind of like a rationalist tragedy if you think about it.                 
      A catharsis for human idiocy; well actually not so different from a normal tragedy now that I think about it.      Except you'know in tone, and the fact the tragedy is on a worldwide scale.

        I've been told that Kubrick repeatedly tried to write a somber, meaningful film about WWIII, and in the end found that he couldn't, and he just had to make it funny (gallows humor).

      Oh, whoops.

      ...Really? I'd call it absurdist more than anything...

        The characters are writ slightly larger than life; but apart from that, they're all responding rationally to their incentives, and even trying to set up more beneficial incentive structures.  In a way that just happens to accidentally end all life on earth.

  The USA release date is the 4th, so I'm guessing you saw it in Hong Kong?  I'd be curious to know if there's any differences -- was your version subbed or dubbed?

    ```
    It's released in the UK for over a week too
    ```

      Ah, got it.  When I went looking for "Doctor Strange release dates" the only ones I saw immediately were HK/USA.  Should have kept looking, I suppose.

    France, French dub. I don't think it mattered, the parts that annoyed me most (eternal life is bad and you will be punished for wanting it, the sort of anti-epistemological message) aren't language-dependent.

  I don't really go to marvel movies expecting rationality. I usually save them for my flights.

  If you want relatively rational use of magic and supertech in a comic book verse, may I recommend the fanfic [With This Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-thread-twelve.25032/) (DC Young Justice self-insert)? It has some writing problems, but the main actually approaches magic with the appropriate level of "why are you not applying gains from trade to this?!"

    ```
    I think WTR dances around the problem without solving it. It doesn't address the fact that Joker's rampages where he kills thousands of people really aren't that bad if all those people go to Heaven afterwards, for instance.

    And while it does point out, eg the absurdity of a setting with super advanced technologies that don't spread, it doesn't make the setting any less absurd.
    ```
