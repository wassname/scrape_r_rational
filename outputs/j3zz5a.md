  Was I expecting Neo Nazis versus vampires? No, but I enjoyed it anyway.

  I'm looking forward to nick having a chance to reflect on the monster he's become (and the fact prayers affect him). He's taking all this pretty well.

  Do you imagine he still has the mind of a child? Not intellectually, but emotionally. It's interesting how little he's wanted to visit his family...

  Thanks for part 2, looking forward to the next chapter!
