  In the Traitorous vs Irritant debate I've always been on the side of Irritant 

  But betraying an Angel in such a manner that it *falls* and suffers eternal damnation is an act that arguably hasn't yet been beaten by anyone in the entire series
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    *Yet* being the operative term, Kairos still has that trial planned for the White Knight, and we all know that the Seraphim are going to try and intervene in that Debacle, the question is if the Heirach's power is enough to Judge an angel without a dimension bound to his name.
    ```

    - u/ricree:
      ```
      I still prefer the theory that Heirarch's aura will force White to Judge the Gods Below while they're on trial, which functionally means the Choir of Judgement will be passing judgment on them, which puts Above and Below into more direct contention. Or at least that's the plan.

      Sparking a full fledged war between the two factions of gods would be the perfect capstone to Tyrant's reign, and completely in line with his character.
      ```

      - u/MythSteak:
        ```
        I thought that hierarch was going to judge the *gods above* using white knight as a focus.

        Remember, the gods below have a seat on the council, they aren’t foreign, and they don’t force people to do things.

        Now think about what Hierarch rants about, isn’t it clear he’s against the gods above what with them being “foreign oppressors” and everything?
        ```

  - u/OmniscientQ:
    ```
    I still find it difficult to pick a side in that particular debate.

    Traitorous was cut from the same cloth as Kairos. He was straight up Evil, with *style*. Dude poisoned himself and framed his entire court for it. It may well be impossible to state with any certainty how many times he usurped the throne from himself.

    Irritant... doesn't really have any big, splashy victories that spring to mind. Just an endless string of Phase 1's. It's annoying to not be able to recall anything Irritant did besides crafting some quality footwear, but that's exactly perfect for him.
    ```

    - u/ATRDCI:
      ```
      Irritant doesn't seem to have big splashy victories because we haven't gotten context in story for them yet.  Traitorous, even before this latest reveal, was described by Ratface as having successfully.betrayed a villain named *the Betrayer*.

      But if we gave Irritant the same in story context he would seem just as great as Traitorous (the Angel falling via betrayal aside).  Cat was awesome for beating back the 12 heroes at the Battle of the Camps? Irritant beat back 9 bands of heroes (so anywhere from 27 to 45 heroes) *all at the same time*
      >“I can’t beat your band of heroes, true, but what if there were another eight bands also out for my blood? Ha! What are you going to do, form a line?”

      He is, if anything, the forebearer of the awesome surrender trick that Cat pulled on Pilgrim
      >"Ah, but being defeated was always part of my plan! Yet another glorious victory for the Empire.”

      From that shoemaker quote we know he had 3 abdications, which means he climbed the Tower *4 separate times.*

      And on the smaller scale, no matter if the heroes "won" Irritant still managed to win as well, whether it's getting the weapons of troublesome High Lords destroyed, refusing to pay an army and have that army conveniently slaughtered by heros, or using palace destruction to employ Keynesian economics to help the Praes economy.

      And style, you want style?  This is the man who invented the pyramid scheme *to trick the High Lords into funding a pyramid*
      >“No, see, you’ll profit as well. All you need is to convince five others of contributing coin and when they do you’ll get a part of their own contribution. It’ll all work out, I promise.”
      – Dread Emperor Irritant, the Oddly Successful, convincing High Lords to invest in the construction of ritual pyramid outside Ater

      And he was no less stylish against heros
      >And so Dread Emperor Irritant addressed the heroes thus: Lo and behold, I fear not your burning Light, for I am already on fire.”

      If it weren't for the latest of Traitorous's feats that got revealed, Irritant would easily be number one for me
      ```

  >“No shit,” the Grey Pilgrim solemnly confirmed.

  Okay, maybe that bit a few chapters ago where I said I was learning to hate Tariq more and more was overstated.

  Interesting moment between Saint and Catherine. I... still don't see things ending anyway but bloody between them, but this feels more like maybe now Saint will end up actually understanding who Catherine really is before the end, and still deciding she needs to be killed because the risk of what she's doing is too high.

    I don't know, he could *not* invasively mind-read everyone he meets like its a completely normal and acceptable thing to do.
    ```

- u/MisterCommonMarket:
  ```
  So Cordelia is digging up the corpse of the angel that Triumphant killed. If Triumphant is sealed inside the corpse i will have a fit. This whole thing is really just a convoluted plot by Neshamah so he can get his boo back.
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Oh god that would be insane, if the next arc is triumphant verses Malicia for the power over the Tower... I honestly can't even imagine.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      They've been praying for her non-return for hundreds of years. It's completely inevitable she does somehow.
      ```

    - u/PrettyDecentSort:
      ```
      The power of the Tower has the pellet with the poison, but the chalice from the Palace has the brew that is true.
      ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    Why would Triumphant be in Procer?

    She brought down the Tower on top of her and all the Crusader Heroes. That's like most of the continent away.
    ```

    - u/ATRDCI:
      ```
      It's been mentioned multiple times how ridiculous the power requirements for teleportation are.  High enough that the mere side effects of teleporting across Calernia could bring down the Tower.

      I'm not saying it's *likely*, but I wouldn't put it past Triumphant to have that sort of contingency.  (Perhaps one that even went rather wrong as the intent would be to use the corpse as a base to put down a completely undefended (as the Crusade is now under Tower rubble in Ater) Procer.  She just got trapped in the corpse instead.
      ```

  ```
  Traitorous is the best Dread Emperor!
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Irritant forever!
    ```

- u/signspace13:
  ```
  Ha! Balck's soul get! So I wonder if Ivah has standing order to bugout once it has that, or to deliver it to Cat, cause it is a pretty important piece on the playing board at the moment and it being in the general vicinity of this cluster fuck is likely not good.
  ```

- u/SeaBornIam:
  ```
  De Purple Drows are De Sneakiest Boyz , no one ever saw purple Drow, even Saint was just hallucinating. IVAAAAGH, rumenarumenarumena!
  ```
