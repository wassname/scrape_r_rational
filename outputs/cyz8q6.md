  That use of backstory was both lazy and ingenious, I love it

  That was such a treat to read :)

  This is spectacular. I haven't read the Culture series, though I've been meaning to correct that and I do have a basic understanding of the setting. A Culture ship is a perfect Death Star. The Barrier is a great standin for death/entropy as rationalist Final Obstacle.

  I am so pleased with this. I love how narrative as a weapon cuts both ways. I enjoy the *Fine Structure*-esque Barrier. I love the Lovecraftian true nature of the Concept. I love the many disparate beings with stakes in this conflict. And I love how when Haley's plots work, it's as satisfying in execution as a great D&D session.

  *Really* looking forward to Sean's chapter.
