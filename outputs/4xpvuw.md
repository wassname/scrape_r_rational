  So UNSONG is what Cauldron would look like if everyone knew it existed, then. Makes sense.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    There is a hole in your cauldron, dear Jala. A hole, a hole.
    ```

  - u/awesomeideas:
    ```
    Well, cauldrons *are* a kind of klipah.
    ```

- u/ThatDarnSJDoubleW:
  ```
  Simeon's excuses don't make sense. If the goal was *really* to have all the names discovered as fast as possible, you'd have your sweatshops somewhere with no minimum wage. Heck, just charge people so that they have to test out a Name every time they use one of the ones that you've copyrighted, and you have a desperate peasant workforce that *doesn't* hate you and *isn't* dying.

  TCK is son of an Archangel of secrets, who founded an organization to keep the Names of God secret and who never explained anything. Do secrets have some sort of power in Unsongverse, aside from the obvious Placebomantic stuff?

  Maybe TCK created UNSONG specifically for the Placebomantic setup it would bring around? Some lone rebels bring the organization down, charge after Hell, and are boosted by their heroic stature?
  ```

  - u/Themnos:
    ```
    I thought it has been explicitly stated in an earlier chapter that using names degraded the stability of the universe. The TCK would every motive to restrict name usage if he was aware of this, right?
    ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    This makes so little sense that it must be UNSONG canon.
    ```

  - u/RMcD94:
    ```
    Yup, solve poverty = less time needed to grow food = more time to farm
    ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  Zombie apocalypse, the peyote version. Far scarier than the average.
  ```

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    Nah, a zombie is a monster with none of its former knowledge or intellect, driven by base instincts. The Drug Lord's servants are reverse-zombies.
    ```

- u/fljared:
  ```
  Possible way around The Green Man's Name problems: 

  Clean out a person of peyote, then keep them at gunpoint to use names.
  ```

  - u/Ulmaxes:
    ```
    Could work. But it reintroduces individuality to the equation, gunpoint or no. Very tricky when your whole advantage relies on every tiny corner of the process being under supreme control.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Might be useful for some industrial and agricultural Names, but the hivemind already has that under control. Military names would be too dangerous unless you could set it up so the sayer was totally unaware of the effect.
      ```

- u/TheUtilitaria:
  ```
  So is 'Universal Love, said the Cactus Person' now UNSONG canon? Seems like it would fit
  ```
