## Rational Fiction for Children?

### Post:

I am a philosophy teacher in Brazil, and I teach kids from 7 to 11. Our classes are more about learning how to think and express yourself than about reading philosophy texts. Most of our classes start out with a story (a short story, a cartoon, a narration, a song, etc). It is very important flr me to try and help them think in a more rational fashion: to understand one should change his mind given evidence, to understand you can test you ideas about the world to see if they proceed, to exercize questioning and curiosity, etc. 

Can you suggest me any story as such that I could use with my students?

  [So You Want To Be A Wizard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/So_You_Want_to_Be_a_Wizard) by Diane Duane is a great series I read as a kid that still holds up well as YA books. They explore space and alien perspectives well, and has an interesting magic system.

  IIRC the series got a direct reference in HPMOR too.

    That was my request as prize for I-forget-what :D

    If interested: /r/errantry isn't very active, but the author's [*give me everything you've got*](https://ebooks.direct/collections/this-weeks-bestsellers/products/the-i-want-everything-youve-got-package) package is 50% off at the moment and the best books for the money I know of anywhere.

    **Highly** recommended.

      Give it another read some time! I love finding old books I forgot about and diving in for a re-read for nostalgia and new perspectives on the characters and settings and whatnot. Sometimes there's even a sequel waiting for you when you finish.

      Honestly the only part of SYWTBAW that I remember wearing on me the last time I read books a handful of years ago was the YA romance stuff. All in all it's a fantastic series for kids/teens, much better written than *some other* magic-fantasy series that swept me up as a kid in the 00's.

  The Phantom Tollbooth by Norton Juster. Should be about right for that age group.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Tollbooth)

    There's also a rationalist retelling of the story: [Nyssa in the Realm of Possibility](http://nyssa.elcenia.com/nitrop.shtml).

    ```
    This is probably firmly irrational, much in the same way Unsong is. Probably my favorite book of all time though, and great for the age group.

  You may want to take a look on stories by Scott Alexander.

  https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3u39yg/a_collection_of_scott_alexanders_literary_works/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


  There are some interesting short stories, which may be fun to analyze with kids.

    My favorite is https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/06/03/asches-to-asches/ 
    , as it really shows you should question everything if you want to be rational. 

    The problem may be that the stories are not translated to Portuguese, sorry if it is critical. There is also one " fuck " in the last sentence of the story, so it may be not as child friendly as I thought.

      This one is great! 
      The foreign language issue is not exactly a problem, since I can retell the stories, or translate them if necessary. This one I'm thinking of retelling to my 10 year olds. Very interesting indeed!

  u/TK17Studios often recommends students read [Mister Fred](https://smile.amazon.com/Mister-Fred-Jill-Pinkwater/dp/0525447784), which is a story about a wacky substitute teacher teaching kids.

  I wouldn't call them rational, but the Sideways Stories from Wayside School series often had elements of trying to think through a problem rationally, usually with irrational results. There was also a book of lateral thinking math puzzles, which encouraged that kind of thought.

  Of course, Star Trek is full of those kinds of stories, you might be able to condense something there.

  There are lots of great science series that encouraged that kind of thought for me as a kid. Bill Nye, Magic Schoolbus.

  You're right though, that can be hard to find.

  It's a bit long, but the animated series "Avatar, the last airbender" has many elements of rationality. The characters have internal lives and motivations, which guide their behavior throughout. While there isn't so much scientific-based reasoning the way there are in some rational stories, both protagonist and antagonist characters are forced to reevaluate their beliefs and actions as the story progresses and many challenging philosophical questions are touched on in a way that does them a surprising amount of credit while still being accessible to children.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    On the same note, the netflix animated show [Hilda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCojP2Ubuto) is also pretty great, it's one of the few kid's shows that I think could rival Avatar in quality, depending on the quality of the second season(due this year!). 

    It has less of a focus on relationships and character arcs, instead focusing on plot and setting, and it knocks it out of the park on wit and charm and wonder and whimsy.

    edit: the source material is a [graphic novel ](https://www.amazon.ca/Hilda-Troll-Book-Luke-Pearson/dp/1909263788) that is also unusually good.

  Don't have any recommendations, I'm afraid, but.... Teacher here, too, and I love this idea! We really should focus more on teaching kids *how* to think and analyze not only a story, but also themselves. Kudos to you!

  - u/viQcinese:
    ```
    Thanks! Kudos to us. Teaching is a very demanding job. If you are interested in the subject, there are some interesting authors that make exactly this apology of philosophy with kids. Most notably, Matthew Lipman. He talks about creating a "thinking community" in the classroom. I don't like his writing style very much, but his ideas are great, and they were very influential in the field.

  In first or second grade we read "The Big Orange Splot." I always loved that book. It isn't really about rationality as much as self expression and not conforming just because everyone else does.

  The main character, Mr. Plumbean, lives on a "neat street" where all the houses look the same. A seagull flies over his house and drops a can of bright orange paint on his roof, but instead of repainting his house to look like all the others on the street, Mr. Plumbean paints it to resemble his dreams. His neighbors send people to talk him into repainting his house to look like theirs, but everyone he talks to ends up painting their houses like their dreams also. In the end, all the neighbors say:

  >"Our street is us and we are it. Our street is where we like to be, and it looks like all our dreams."

  From what I remember, the original Scooby Doo cartoons were pretty strongly rational.  The thinking / problem solving parts anyhow.  Lots of over the top humor, of course, but in the end, those darn kids and that dog always found a rational explanation for the mysteries.

  The animated movie [Smallfoot](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WesternAnimation/Smallfoot) is about as pro-science and curiosity as Hollywood ever gets. (And, interestingly enough for a children's animated movie, *none* of the characters are evil.)

    Oddly enough there is a translation to Portuguese, which I have not yet read. I'm half way through the original and really excited about the story. Also, thinking a lot about how to create something similar with Portuguese thinking-idioms. We say things like "with the head on the clouds" to mean someone is not paying attention, and "stop to think" to mean simply "think about it!"

  Hmm, I think a lot of the things on this sub are fine for children, they're smarter than people give them credit for and a lot of stuff on this sub is dumber than we like to admit. I think something on the lines of morality tales but the morals are usually "it depends". Off the top of my head there's The Sword Of Good or the whispering earing. 
  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3p2yup/the_whispering_earing/
  "Cordyceps: Too smart for their own good" Would be effective but probably also give them nightmares.

  Brave New World is not a short story but it is philosophically interesting with the setting being simultaneously a utopia and distopia, it also doesn't have "sides" or "answers" a world is described and within it people do things, whether these are good or bad things is something left up to the reader to judge. Though it does have themes some might not consider apropriate for children. Although it might not really be relevant I find Bogleech's story competitions attract stories that aren't so much horrific as thoughtful and deeply strange.

    Children yes. But more towards the upper 9-13 range of childhood. I wouldn't recommend almost any of the works posted on /r/rational to any 6-8 year olds, even the exceptional ones.

  #The Great Brain

  > The Great Brain is a series of children's books by American author John Dennis Fitzgerald (1906–1988). Set in the small town of Adenville, Utah, between 1896 and 1898, the stories are loosely based on Fitzgerald's childhood experiences.

  Truly, one of the great series of children’s literature. The prototype for HPMOR’s protagonist. Also:

  > The "Miss Pickerell" series recounts the comic adventures of a clever, eccentric old woman and her human and animal sidekicks. Often, these characters use their knowledge of science to deal with the challenges which confront them.

  I don’t know how well these would work for your exact purposes, but I would definitely recommend them to any science-focused kids.
