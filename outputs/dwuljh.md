  The link bot is super handy. It might be worth handing it its own dedicated account though, that way it's clearly a bot, rather than making it look like you're just a diligent person who wants to link all the things
  ```

  - u/Endovior:
    ```
    This. Bots should be clearly identified as such, and the best way to do that is a dedicated account for bot posts.
    ```

  - u/Lightwavers:
    ```
    That's certainly possible. New accounts are rate limited very heavily until they acquire both age and karma, so I am reluctant to do this, but if this comment gets more upvotes than the other options in the poll get upvotes, then if the bot is reinstated I will switch to what is clearly a bot account for at least this subreddit.

      Isn't there a subreddit specifically for letting new bots "farm" karma?

  I hate to downplay it with a meme, but this is why we can't have nice things. So much overblown drama and grandstanding over a controversial implementation of a useful tool that didn't really affect anyone before the arguments started in its wake.

  In the spirit of being rational about this, some talking points:

  - A poll that only a fraction of the userbase will vote on (and others might manipulate) isn't reliable or valid. Also, you're baiting controversy by including loaded questions. Users don't have the right to decide whether someone will be banned. And responding to every random person's loud opinion on why you suck just derails the actual discussion.

  - It's a objectively useful tool that you took the time to code (and nobody else before you, I might add). At this point, it's entirely the mods' discretion. Since lots of people are calling into your "trustworthiness" in reinstating a bot that has clearly stated functions, maybe leave the running of the bot to the mods? I agree with /u/Amagineer that the bot should have its own account though.

  To everyone else, he made a mistake. It's not the end of the world or the sub. Be positive. It's disheartening to see a post cautioning against negativity trigger so much of it.

  *A* link bot could be activated on this subreddit, provided that:

  * the bot should have a separate account of its own
   * this account should have nothing on it except a comment history of PSA story links — *maybe* also some announcement comments on update logs and techsupport communication. It should not have moderator positions on any subreddits, should not be factually advertising through its profile page any user’s reddit activity, their subreddits, their opinions, their culture warfare activity, etc.
   * this subreddit’s wiki should have an added rule for story pages (if it doesn’t already) that forbids adding anything that is not a neutrally written description of the story. If story tagging on the wiki is allowed, for the tags themselves there should be some mechanism to vote out / petition to remove non-neutral or politically / culturally / morally biased tags. It’s better to not have any information at all, than to risk getting hijacked / overwhelmed by any kind of agenda / culture warfare down the line.
  * the bot comments should optionally include only the following and nothing more: the stories’ hosting pages, backup mirrors and text files, link to an infopage about the bot itself, scrapped synopsis info from the hosting website. No wiki page links (at least for the time being), no extra reviews, no ratings, no tags (except maybe technical ones, like "Completed", "WiP", etc). One rather good example for this is [/u/FanfictionBot](https://github.com/tusing/reddit-ffn-bot/wiki/Usage).

  Subreddit-scale automated addition of subjective qualifiers, over and over, would encourage groupthink; while the same addition of links to the same review comments would encourage stagnation and opinion calcification.

    Disagree; I think if we're going to have recommendation threads in general, we could do with a page that aggregated reviews instead of the same things being said each time the story was mentioned.

  [EDIT: To clarify the purpose of this post: My position is not "/u/lightwavers should be forcibly ousted from this community," but more, "/u/lightwavers, your behavior *really sucks*, please stop being that way in this community going forward."]

  One of the poll options currently tied for most votes is "Ban both the bot and the user behind the account from the subreddit."  That might seem like a slightly over-the-top response, without a lot of comments to back it up, so I'd like to explain my reason for voting this way.

  There are some offenses that can be resolved with a simple exchange of:

  "Hey, just so you know, we don't do that around here."

  "Oh, my bad.  I'll refrain from doing that in the future."

  For example, if someone moves into the neighborhood and starts using his leaf blower at 8 AM on a Saturday, I might give him a heads up that hey, leaf blowers are loud and some people like to sleep in, and we all sort of have a collective pact as a community to not run the leaf blowers before 9:30 AM.

  However, there are certain kinds of behavior that are *so* deviant that it makes me think that one simple interaction of "hey, we don't do that here" is going to be enough to correct that decision.  For example, if I walk out of my home at 8 AM on a Saturday and see my new neighbor defecating on the sidewalk, I don't expect to get a reaction of, "Oh, my bad, I'll refrain from doing that in the future."  *And*, even if my neighbor says, "Oh, my bad, I didn't realize there was a community standard against defecation, it's actually really common where I'm from," it makes me fear that the next time I walk outside, I'll also have to tell him, "By the way, we also prefer that you confine your sexual escapades to the interior of your abode rather than doing it out here on your lawn in full view of the public."

  So, if it seems like people are reluctant to engage in a good-faith discussion of *why* they're willing to cast a "ban this user" vote, it may be because you have a history of behavior that makes them think you wouldn't react well if you tried to engage them in a good-faith discussion of that subject.

  Let's start with the least of your offenses: I have a problem with the idea of creating a bot that injects your subjective opinion into discussions unsolicited.  This isn't some kind of but that can be summoned electively by some kind of [[syntax]]; you created a bot that made it such that any time I decided to discuss a certain work, an automated response would come to post in the thread to alert everyone that the work is "low quality."  Uh, okay.  People come to /r/rational to discuss various works, and if you'd like to participate in that discussion then you're welcome to do so, but I don't really have any interest in arguing a bot, especially when it appears when every time I mention a work.  It's like a little kid who follows you around waiting for you to mention your favorite band, just so that he can scream "THAT BAND SUCKS."  Frustrating, because I know that the kid is unpersuadable and has infinite energy and it really makes me just not want to talk about anything when he can just trample over anything that I have to say with something that seems designed to end discussion.

  That's a "running your leaf blower at 6 AM on a Saturday" kind of offense.  But I don't think that's where the strong reaction is coming from, and I don't think this is why people are willing to express (when given the option to cast an anonymous ballot) that they'd like to see you ousted from the community.  I think *that* has much more to do with the political thing, which I could make a long and mired argument about, but which I'll simply summarize using what I think is the most glaring and illustrative example:

  When you say to someone that you're [dismissing everything they have to say because elsewhere in the thread they expressed views that you decided made them deserving of the "Nazi supporter" label](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvoq4i/meta_are_the_low_quality_tags_too_harsh/f7egitk/?context=3) (and that, as a Nazi supporter, they can be assumed to be acting in bad faith), do you not see the irony? I think it should be self-evident to most people why "I'm going to dismiss you entirely because I have analyzed your arguments and diagnosed you as being part of the Evil outgroup" is a terrible mode of conduct, and if you're one of the people who *don't* regard this point as self-evident, I'm not sure what could be said to persuade you.

  There's another sentiment of yours:

  >[My philosophy: suffuse online spaces with anti-Nazi sentiment before Nazis take over. Else, they stand a good chance of succeeding. Sorry if I'm missing nuance.](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dvsizg/meta_regarding_ulightwavers_objectionable_author/f7f2efy/)

  When I move into a neighborhood and see lots of "No murderers welcome here" signs, my thought isn't, "ah, good, people who agree with me on the importance of murder-intolerant norms," my thought is, "what the fuck?"  And then when I talk to one of the neighbors about it, he says, "Sure, missy!  I agree with you, murders are bad!  We hate murderers around here.  \*glances around\*.  You know what I mean by 'murderers,' right?  Hate them sons of bitches with their murdering ways.  Old man Jenkins who lives on block over is a murderer, you know?  It's true.  He plead guilty, served 30 years for it, that's a matter of public record, you can go right down to the courthouse and see the proof yourself. And he thinks he can just *live in our city?*  Well, he can't get away with it, not in this neighborhood!  Morty might tell you otherwise, but can't trust Morty, on account of him being a murder-sympathizer -- just look at how he fraternizes with old man Jenkins on weekends, playing checkers out on the porch despite Mr. Jenkins being a convicted murder. Good thing that thanks to good neighbors like me, everyone knows not to associate with Jenkins -- or Morty either, that murder-sympathizing son-of-a-bitch. Anyway, welcome to the neighborhood, friend!  Just as long as you agree that murder is bad and don't sympathize with any murderers, we're going to get along fine!"  It's the kind of thing that makes me think, "I think this counter-signaling is suggesting the presence of something really pernicious that might extend beyond just being against murders."

  Someone who believes that the only way to avoid Nazis taking over is to proactively suffuse a community with anti-Nazi sentiment seems like a really unpleasant neighbor.  I'm a member of many communities where *not once* has anyone taken the time to say, "Nazis, fuck those guys, right?" and yet those communities have for years been filled with wonderful, compassionate, and charitable people and *an astounding lack of Nazi presence.*  I think that if my local meatspace community were confronted with a "literal Nazi," our reaction might be something like, "Huh, this 14-year-old white suburban kid probably became this way because he felt socially alienated and discovered that he was accepted by people on alt-right message boards who managed to successfully indoctrinate him, it seems to me that socially isolated people are most vulnerable to alt-right rhetoric and so maybe ostracizing and socially isolating people like that runs a very high risk of being counter-productive if our goal is to live in a world with fewer literal Nazis. Of course, if you believe that raining down 'anti-that-kid' vitriol and barring him from interacting with us *is* a way to create fewer literal Nazis then I'm of course willing to entertain that notion as well, and we can see how well it holds up to basic epistemic rigor."

  I'll also say this: I am a fanfic writer who has been part of this community for many years. In fact, I am a fanfic writer whose work has been posted in this subreddit on many occasions in this subreddit, and which many users (you included) have commented on (favorably, in fact).  I have in the past participated in various discussions on this subreddit (of other people's work more than my own, in fact).  I'm reluctant to share more details for fear of identifying myself, because I think this whole thing is so utterly toxic, which is why I'm posting this from an account that is not connected to my usual and much more active happy-go-lucky fanfic loving and fanfic writing account.  In fact, I think this whole thing is so toxic that I'm probably going to avoid posting on this subreddit from my main account for awhile until this whole thing dies down, which *sucks* because a decent amount of my support comes from people who discovered me through this sub and I've enjoyed being a participant but quite frankly I don't a bunch of attention and scrutiny from the kind of people who are really into branding people with scarlet letters for having bad political opinions.  (After all, several paragraphs back I suggested that maybe it might be a valid strategy when confronted with a 14-year-old alt-right kid might *not* be to immediately chase them into the woods and socially isolate them, which I'm sure is enough for certain people to also brand me as a "Nazi sympathizer."

  >Edit2: going to sleep. Discussion is good, but please don’t set the sub on fire.

  This subreddit is astoundingly chill most of the time, one of the few parts of Reddit that is still fun and about weird and geeky people talking about the hobbies things that make them happy (or unhappy, or bored, or "frustrated with the bad prose," or whatever).  The only time I've seen real "fire" on /r/rational has been over the past few days, so it strikes me as more than a tad ironic to see you patronizingly telling us to behave ourselves while you're asleep.

  EDIT: changes to clarify the distinction between quotes and characterizations thereof.  Also, added a follow-up that doesn't fit in the body of this post due to character limits

    > When you say, "I'm dismissing your arguments because the arguments you expressed made it clear that you're a Nazi supporter, which makes it clear that you're arguing in bad faith," do you not see the irony?

    First, just as a general request, when you use quotation marks, can you please *actually* be quoting what a person said (or, at least, indicate that you're paraphrasing)?  I had a much different opinion about your post when I thought that this was, word-for-word, what u/Lightwavers had said.

    Second... I know that we strive to be better here, but, I just don't see how "dismissing the opinion of someone in an apparent outgroup" is a ban-worthy offense.  That's about 90% of all political discourse.  Yes, I absolutely agree that it *shouldn't* be,  but you're essentially asking for someone to be banned for normal human behaviour (even *contemporarily* and *culturally* normal human behaviour).

    Finally, in response to:

    >However, there are certain kinds of behavior that are so deviant that it makes me think that one simple interaction of "hey, we don't do that here" is going to be enough to correct that decision. For example, if I walk out of my home at 8 AM on a Saturday and see my new neighbor defecating on the sidewalk, I don't expect to get a reaction of, "Oh, my bad, I'll refrain from doing that in the future."

    I disagree with the idea of banning someone because of some intuition about what they might do in the future.

    Yes, Lightwavers screwed up.  I don't think there's anyone arguing to the contrary here.  But a ban seems like a *ridiculously* over-the-top overreaction to the crime committed, especially given the community rule "Unless you're obviously a bot, spammer, or troll we will start by talking, not removing posts or handing out bans."

    I'm agnostic on the idea of the reinstatement of the bot (really, if someone describes something interesting, I can LMGTFMyself, but I don't deny it's more convenient to have the link at hand), but I am ardently against banning someone for two offenses, one of which you describe as "[not] where the strong reaction is coming from," and for the other, your rationale is (I'm paraphrasing here): "he can't get away with saying 'he can't get away with this, not in this neighborhood,' not in this neighbourhood!"

      Good point, I have edited this portion of the post.  (I tend to use reddit's \>block quotes when quoting something someone directly said in order to respond to it, but I can definitely see how my use of quotation marks could mislead people about the actual content of the post.)

      >  your rationale is (I'm paraphrasing here): "he can't get away with saying 'he can't get away with this, not in this neighborhood,' not in this neighbourhood!"

      I wasn't suggesting that he be ousted from the community; my "neighborhood analogy" was less about identifying neighbors who need to be ousted, and more about identifying neighbors who might not respond positively if you walked up to them and said, "Uh, could you not?"  Or more specifically, it was not my way of justifying, "This is why I want you banned," it was more a way of expressing, "Hey, it looks like there's way more people willing to cast a ballot than are willing to explain to you down in the comments why they disapprove.  Here's a reason why that might be!"  (This was partly spurned on by an edit to the original post that communicated something to the effective of, 'hey looks like there's a lot of votes saying I should be banned, so could you please stop spoofing votes to make this result show up.'

      I realize that my remarks may have been unclear, so [I have made a follow-up post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/dwuljh/meta_should_the_redesigned_link_bot_be_activated/f7mv3hu/) clarifying my position (added as a separate post since it doesn't fit under the character limit of the original post).
      ```

  - u/JudyKateR:
    ```
    As a general post-script:

    I guess I should clarify my position: I do not wish for the moderators to actually ban you based on the democratic will of those polled.  However, I do wish to express, with the strongest vehemence I can muster: *stop it*.

    Your mode of conduct is making the community worse, and not just worse, but transforming it from one of my favorite places on the internet into a place that is like my least favorite places on the internet.  I think that you (and the subreddit) would be best served if you took a long, hard look at your behavior to consider for a moment, "Wait a minute, am *I* the problem here?"  (A temporary ban would achieve that, but so would a period of voluntary and self-imposed exile, and I hope that you opt for the latter.)

    Ordinarily, I would have let the poll results speak for themselves rather than spending the time to express at length why I feel negatively. However, after your first edit:

    >I know strawpolls are really easy to manipulate, but can you not? Thanks.

    I felt the need to do the closest thing I could to grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking while screaming, "Maybe there isn't a conspiracy of someone running a bot network to try and manipulate the vote totals.  Maybe the fact that dozens of people are selecting the poll option for 'get this user out of our community' is *because you have done something that they genuinely felt the need to express extreme disapproval of,* and maybe if I articulate my own reasons for extreme disapproval it will make you realize that others might have reasons for feeling extreme disapproval as well."  To be clear: I don't want you permanently ousted from this community, and if I want a temporary ban it's more out of a desire to give you an opportunity for self-reflection than for anything punitive, but *I really want that vehement disapproval of your actions to register.  There are lots of real human beings who really, really, REALLY don't like what you are doing.*  We are not the ultimate authorities of your actions, and we do not have the power to silence you, but please consider conducting yourself as though many people were staring at you with an intense glare of disapproval.

    Doesn't seem to warrant a user ban, we're a rational subreddit not a neighbourhood worried about immigrants who don't follow the culture norms.

    Even your own analogy I think it'd be better not to evict the person and just you know just try and handle seeing things you might not want to see for the sake of being nice.

    If the reason you want to ban him is because he won't engage with people who he thinks are Nazis then you probably have an enormously wide net to cast.

    Besides which, this isn't a debate subreddit, people are free to disengage on whoever they want.

      > Even your own analogy I think it'd be better not to evict the person and just you know just try and handle seeing things you might not want to see for the sake of being nice.

      I agree with you (and was in agreement with you at the time that I wrote the post, but I did a poor job of communicating that).  I have edited in a pre-script and added an addendum which I hope communicate this more clearly, which is that my post is not an appeal to moderators asking them to ban /u/lightwavers; rather, it is an appeal to /u/lightwavers to take a long hard look in the mirror and consider adjusting their behavior.

      To continue the analogy, if I had a neighbor who defecated publicly, my first reaction would not be to immediately evict them from the neighborhood.  However, I would probably *not* engage them with a friendly tap on the shoulder (as one might when responding to an early morning leafblower, or garbage left out on the curb for too long), and I might enlist the help of some other neighbors before confronting them, partly because I think numbers might be necessary to communicate "No, really, that behavior is *really frowned upon* here," and partly because in my personal experience, street-defecators do not respond well to polite taps on the shoulder.  What I'm attempting to do here with my post is one step up from "polite tap on the shoulder" (/u/lightwavers has already gotten plenty of those across many other threads), but it was not my intent to escalate immediately from "polite tap on the shoulder" to "run them out of town."

      >Besides which, this isn't a debate subreddit, people are free to disengage on whoever they want.

      Right, and it was not my intent to suggest that /u/lightwavers be banned for failing to engage with other users.  My point was more like, "hey, you seem to be bothered by the lack of good-faith arguments leveled at you, and assume that the lack of good-faith arguments accompanying the vote tally must be evidence of some vote tampering (see /u/lightwavers' first edit). In light of that, perhaps I should explain to you *why* people might not be willing to engage you in good faith, given your history on this subreddit."

  I think a link bot would be a nice thing to have but not something we *need*, specially not if it comes up with *baggage* of its own. Why can't it just be a simple link bot like [Marvin](https://www.reddit.com/user/The-Paranoid-Android) from the SCP sub? I mean users that want to discuss the quality, themes, politics, and enjoyment of the fics can start a thread in this sub, it's kind of the point isn't it? To discuss rational or rationalist works of fiction, as per the sidebar.

  And I call it baggage because I think that is what it is going to end up being, the same thing as before the redesign except with the extra step of it being on a wiki, a point of contention that will only bring more drama and negativity in the long term. It's merely my opinion, but I have a reason to think this:

  Good faith. This is a relatively small and low-key sub, there aren't that many users active at any given time, and it's not a sub that's constantly flooded with content. I'm not going to say we're all friends here or that we know/recognize each other, but there is a community here with a considerable number of regulars. Good faith and this community's cooperation (along with the mods' unseen hand) is what keeps it running, it makes things like the popular recommendation threads work, and seeing (almost) everyone being civil and relatively calm as far as discussions of any particular fic or topic goes makes one want to keep on coming here. 

  I'll be blunt: You messed up. You should have asked the community first about implementing the bot (and how far you should go with it) and then you should have asked the mods for permission once your bot was ready to go. Because this isn't something that affects only you but the entire community and its moderators, and it was done without our consent and without giving us the ability to either opt-in or opt-out (unlike with a plugin or something like a Greasemonkey script)

  For that, and for your overall (rather unpleasant) character, I do not think it wise to trust you with this task. Letting someone who isn't open to discussion, who thinks their own morals and opinions are above others, and who has no problem dictating what others should think? (As you did with the bot before the redesign) Frankly, it sounds like a recipe for disaster.

  I don't want this to be seen like a personal attack, because I don't know you nor could I care less about you or your views, but I care quite a lot about this sub and the discussion it has to offer, I'd rather not see an entire community jeopardized by a single individual's will. Again, good faith, I don't think you have much of it. I'd rather leave all this work to a more level-headed and trustworthy individual.

    The point of the Wiki isn't that it has a "low quality" tag, in fact that'd be prohibited under the netiquette I proposed, which says that Wiki posts should only contain people's personal reactions and if negative should not be written to imply that anyone else shouldn't enjoy the work.  The point of the Wiki would be to aggregate reviews, including negative reviews, and that would prevent people from having to repeat the same info over and over each time somebody mentions or recommends a particular fic.  It'd create institutional memory, which is usually a good thing.

      What about a community that is unconditionally intolerant of intolerance?  I think that's more what many of us are concerned about, particularly when the decision of what qualifies is being made by a self-appointed person who seems, let's say, ill-suited for the role.

      Frankly, I think worrying about this sub, which is quite possibly 25%+ Jewish, being overrun by Nazis is paranoid and silly.  A out-of-control autoimmune disease seems way more likely to be a problem than Nazi AIDS.

  I will be seriously disappointed if you are run out of this subreddit. I'm not going to go through and reply to every other thread here, but  I will say that I feel you've done your best to be civil and take every argument seriously. I'm very troubled about what it means for this subreddit going forward if people like you are going to be kicked out for trying to make something cool for the community and to take its feedback seriously.

  So I guess this is my petition to the mods to deny /u/Lightwavers' request to be banned.

    I think they've been extremely uncivil in basically every discussion around this. That's why I think they should be temp-banned; the bot was annoying and antisocial, but how they reacted to criticism about it is a more serious problem. They can interact with /r/rational read-only for a month or two.
