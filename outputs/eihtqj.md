  Leaf: You need to apologize to Red.  
  Blue: What? No, he has to apologize to ME.  
  Leaf: You literally told him he should have died.  
  Blue: Well, obviously I didn't *mean* it.  
  Leaf: What if, and this is just a theory, Red doesn't think that's obvious.  
  Blue: ...Shit.

  Ahh, I was so glad this conversation happened. I really like that we address the Aiko thing from all sorts of different perspectives in this chapter, and that we got to see all 3 of our protags interact. Last time we got a Leaf POV was the big argument itself!
  ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    Followed later by
    Red: Leaf, do you blame me for Aiko?
    Leaf: No, why would you... oh, wow I'm a hypocrite.

    Getting all of this out in the open really feels like a new beginning for the group. What a perfect way to end the year/begin the decade.

  ```
  "Every region needs its own legendary under a trainer's control. That way no region would want to mess with them. They could just send their trainer over and wreak nearly as much havoc in revenge."

  Quite some parallels to nuclear weapons here, but there are some key differences. One is that the number of legendaries are limited - once they're all caught, there won't be anymore. The other is how people assume that, at least at first, a single trainer will be controlling a caught legendary. That's a lot of responsibility to put on a single person, especially since they might even be a teenager at the time. Scary stuff.

  It felt as if I should have a strong response to the name Natural, but I just haven't played enough of the games to know who that is. He seems to have a bulbapedia page, maybe I'll read that. Or maybe just play Black/White? Is there a way to do that without a console?
  ```

  - u/NuzlockedReap:
    ```
    I didn't know who Natural was either. I didn't play the Unova games. So I looked him up. [Here's a link to Natural's page on bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/N).
    ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    Natural (simply "N" in the games) is a central character to the story from Black/White, and his introduction absolutely made me reel. We've seen so many earthshaking* sideplots getting hinted and twisted together (we've already got Mewtwo, the Hoenn disasters, and now Unova's too?) -- I'm honestly kinda afraid that they'll overshadow our protagonists! Intellectually though, I'm also really curious how N will be adapted to this version of the Pokémon world.

    \* I mean, *every* region's story in the games after gold/silver has dramatically earthshaking consequences, and so far Daystar has made each and every detail even scarier!
    ```

  - u/jimmy77james:
    ```
    It reminds me of the jinchuriki in Naruto, or at least the way they’re handled in rational fanfic.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      That was also my exact reaction, with the additional caveat that there are still wars all the time in the Naruto-verse even when the jinchuriki aren't abused enough to abandon their village entirely. It doesn't quite work out like that when you hand WMD's to every country, there are still bad actors who can now cause a lot more damage.
      ```

  - u/Putnam3145:
    ```
    Yeah, realizing who it was as i read the first paragraph made me a bit giddy, so your impression vis a vis intended response strength is probably accurate
    ```

    - u/PDNeznor:
      ```
      It took me a bit to realize it was N, but when it hit I got all giddy and super excited to see him introduced. But also sad that he will only be shown through text. Still cant wait to see how his appearance ropes team plasma into leaf's storyline. Interesting that with all the talk throughout the chapter of escalating national threat levels by catching legendaries is contrasted by ending the chapter with the introduction of the person who wants to de-escalate threats by releasing captured pokemon. (P.S. is N gonna be a psychic in this series to explain how he can talk to pokemon? Thatd be an obvious explanation but I cant remember if he's ever shown interacting with dark types.)
      ```

      - u/AKAAkira:
        ```
        > I cant remember if he's ever shown interacting with dark types

        Zorua.
        ```

        - u/PDNeznor:
          ```
          Oh yeah, good catch. N is an enigma in a hat.
          ```

          - u/covert_operator100:
            ```
            N could be a psychic with the 'special' ability that dark types can link with him in a one-sided link (like the opposite of Red's shield, the pokemon perceives him but he doesn't perceive them).
            ```

  - u/Sirra-:
    ```
    If you really want to play black/white, I recommend looking up the DeSmuME emulator.
    ```

  - u/chaos-engine:
    ```
    But if one person controls the legendary, all you need is to send an assassin after him and then the region will be vulnerable...(unless the legendary pokeball is kept in a secure vault and can be quickly transferred to another ownership)
    ```

- u/DaystarEld:
  ```
  Welcome back, and hope you all had/have a safe and happy new year's day :)
  ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    Happy New Year/Decade Daystar! Right back at you.
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Thanks!
      ```

  - u/I_Probably_Think:
    ```
    I was having a merely mediocre day, but seeing your update immediately made it a happy new year!

    ... that sounded sappy, but I'm being honest here...

    e: letters haha
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      Glad to hear it ;)
      ```

  - u/VivaLaPandaReddit:
    ```
    Great chapter! It really feels like our protagonists are moving towards healing, I always love to see that. You've made a very cool world here.
    Wish I didn't have to wait so long for releases, but I guess that's the cost for quality 😉
    ```

- u/TheJungleDragon:
  ```
  Ooh, seeing (I presume) N appear is a neat surprise. I had somewhat resigned myself to this being mostly focused on Kanto (the worldbuilding for the other regions really interests me), but this, alongside the mentions of Archie and Maxie earlier in the story make me excited for some wider scale plots of both the antagonistic and protagonistic varieties.
  ```

  - u/Radix2309:
    ```
    I feel like Hoenn will be tangently involved, but more indirectly with Rocket's business, and maybe Mewtwo. I think thr focus will be mainly Kanto.
    ```

- u/Cschollen:
  ```
  The N reveal was fucking cool. And hey now we'll have two characters that are awkwardly named letters!

  Speaking of which the little interaction between Leaf and MG made me chuckle. 

  Other than that like others said it mainly felt like a clean up chapter. Tying up some loose plotlines, connecting some others together while reminding people of earlier chapters. 

  Not too mention setting new goals for people, Red already has his but giving a more defined role to Blue and a new arc for Leaf. Its looking good! 

  Happy new years Daystar and may I say the worst part of my day besides the hangover haha is the fact that we won't be getting another chapter til next month :(

  Since the moment the whole safely releasing pokemon to the wild thing came up I was totally expecting team plasma to take interest and use it to their ends, but didn't expect N to already appear this chapter.

    >Also, Poliwhirl get pregnant? I thought they'd reproduce like amphibians, not mammals.

    Perhaps they are similar to the [suriname toad?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Surinam_toad)
    ```

  - u/PDNeznor:
    ```
    Red's been tiptoeing around the interlude stuff while with Sabrina, and Blue seems to be totally clueless about the side plots. So I dont think it's the first time, but definitely the most explicit. Maybe we'll get more involvement by the time Blue's story hits Fuchsia City.
    Pokemon biology seems to be reptilian if 
    anything, with the egg-laying and all.

  "I'm here because I think it's important, as important as what you're doing, understand?"

  This isn't a sentence with a lot of thought, just a kind of tossed off hat on the real message of her anger, but the reason that their friend group was doomed to split up is that Blue, Red and Leaf would each register that sentence coming from Leaf to Blue, and his subsequent apology in this particular situation as meaning a different thing.
  ```

- u/JJReeve:
  ```
  With all this talk of pokeball conditioning and even the potential to use pokeball technology to overwrite the brain of pokemon I have to wonder. Is the real reason why no one has solved the human storage issue (edit: specifically the issue that humans get brain damage when stored in pokeballs) because people in power don't want the technology to exist. The sort of abuse humaballs could lead to is quite astounding after all. You could for instance kidnap people and condition them to be unquestionably loyal cultists. And with Bill's hypothetical copy pasting of brain states you could achieve a sort of memetic immortality, and all you have to do is use a TM to murder the person with a mind overwrite.
  ```

  - u/Omegafinity:
    ```
    Really loved the line of thought and the points you made but "*humaballs*" and "*use a TM to murder the person*" straight up made me laugh. Hahah
    ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    Giovanni has such pokeballs. He used one on a Renegade who was working for him but failed his task.  One of the issues he didn't bother getting solved is that the people come back out with the intelligence level expected of a pokemon, not their earlier selves
    ```

    - u/JJReeve:
      ```
      The intelligence declined is what I meant by the human storage issue, though I should have been more clear about it. 

      Right now the human catching balls would be seen by wider society as really elaborate way to kill someone. (Meanwhile people like Bill see them as an extreme measure to avoid death and hope someone can revive them later) If human catching balls could be made fully functional the danger they would represent would be so much greater, think invasion of the body snatchers. So my comment was to wonder if the previous attempts to solve the human cognitive decline problem were failed intentionally.
      ```

      - u/MilesSand:
        ```
        Ah I get it now. That's plausible. 

        My own experience with the real world is that a lot of things would be pretty easy to implement but haven't been because it takes a lot of work to get the business side of it going well. Like,  you could make a cryogenic preservation concept into a pokeball form, but to make it useful to anyone you also need to figure out how to store the balls, which can get expensive, and you have to get the knowledge across  to people who would give you money for making the thing, keep on top of legal and social demands, and so on, and if any of that fails the work of development becomes a waste of time because even if someone else takes up the work later they'll have to retread the ground you covered because documentation has a way of evaporating.

  Does everyone Bill talks to get used to that?

  Wait, Leaf is in contact with N now? Oh boy, I wonder how that plotline will develop but I’ll wait and see. It's also nice to see further development on Laura's side of things.

  Unrelated, how do you handle the "the pokémon world can't make sense, just domesticating a growlite would skip the fire mastery technological step and kickstart metalurgy". I know in your world pre-pokeball only a few people could handle them, but they still got to the point of having armies. So pokémon influencing technology is a given, but how you handle that influence? Don't you think those are too many factors to actually predict where humanity should be in that regard at present time?
  ```

  - u/MilesSand:
    ```
    The pokemon world can still exist if, to use the metallurgy example,  the refining process necessary is also different.   Maybe something in the ore in pokeworld makes the process take a more precise combination of heat and electricity than pokemon would naturally provide so that the refining process is limited by trainability, or maybe there's another reason.
    ```

- u/WantDiscussion:
  ```
  I feel a bit silly asking this far into the fic but are dark humans part of Pokemon canon? I've only played gen 1 and 2 so I'm not completely familiar with the lore and can't find anything on the FAQ or anything about it on the pokemon wikis.

        A partial overwrite may be a smaller change, but that doesn't make it an easier one. It's easier to swap a book on the shelf for a different one than it is to combine them into a larger book.
        ```

    - u/MilesSand:
      ```
      Well no you train it, just like all pattern recognition and statistics based software.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Sounds good. With enough work, they can probably train wild Pokemon not to attack on sunny days.
        ```

  - u/Gummysaur:
    ```
    I'm more confused on why partially conditioning is apparently so difficult. "Conditioning" probably isn't one big code, but a bunch of smaller methods (one to make them not attack humans, one to make them listen to commands, etc). Shouldn't it be pretty easy to just...copy that code, but remove some of the methods and maybe add some of your own?
    ```

    - u/Omegafinity:
      ```
      Exactly, it's hard to understand why this is a huge challenge considering how they're already altering brainstates of beings converted into energy. It seems it's just a question of adding, removing and modifying some modules. The bigger issue seems to be what consequences Bill's proposal, if made possible, would have. Copying and modifying brainstates like a piece of code makes it so that you can basically make everything that can be subdued enough to go into a poke ball do your bidding. The parallels with computer programming make me think of the damage viruses and hackers or even untested code could do.
      ```

      - u/covert_operator100:
        ```
        It might be just that the precompile code that achieves this stuff is heavily guarded, so that random terrorists can't create 'sleeper agent' pokemon/pokeballs, or similar terrible things.
        ```

- u/Golden_Magician:
  ```
  A bit late to the party, but I loved this chapter. It was so good! Probably had my favorite character interactions among our protagonists yet. They're all really growing into compelling characters in their own way. And you did justice to all of their perspectives, reasons and motivations. And that twist at the end was sooo great, can't believe I didn't see it coming!
