## [D][RST] What's the rationalistest show you know?

### Post:

The medium almost works against the very idea of rationalism - but a lot of people are much more willing to watch a movie, or a TV series, rather than open a book. Can you suggest any that come within spitting distance of being Rationalist Fiction?

I have a mild preference for HSF, so I'll propose a couple of movies as lower bounds: 2001 and Moon. If you can think of any visual media that are more rationalist than those, then feel free to suggest them. :)

  *Death Note* comes within spitting distance, but has some flaws, and sometimes seems to be pretending at rationality rather than *actually* being rational. I'm fairly sure that there are other anime series that come close as well, but I'm not a huge anime fan.

  Movies ... some of them at least touch on the themes that I like, but I wouldn't say that they're *rational* unless I really lower the bar. *The Man from Earth* was, for the most part, a nice, rational exploration of the concept, but I remember it falling down near the end (though I can't quite recall why). I really liked *Her*, because I thought it was one of the best treatments of A.I. I've seen in a long time. But again, that's spitting distance, not actually rational. Oh, and obviously *Primer*.

    The Man from Earth falls down a bit when [](#s "he reveals he was the historical figure who inspired the Jesus legend").

      For me, it fell down when [ ](#s "he hinted at being that one guy's father, and was actually recognized by him as being such. I really liked how it was open ended before then, was he actually telling the truth about being immortal or lying? But after that you have to take what he's claimed as fact. The Jesus part was a little odd for me, but it didn't completely ruin it for me like the very end did.")

        I think that must have been what I didn't like. In the movie *Men Who Stare At Goats* there's this whole "is it real" thing that gets built up over the course of the film, and then, in the last three seconds before the credits roll, [](#s "they ruined it by having someone do something explicitly supernatural.") Which seems to defeat the whole point of everything that came before it.

          The whole movie is supposed to be a comedy of sorts, where the premise is based on real experiments meant to prove something that obviously doesn't exist. [ ](#s "Having it all be true in the very, very end" ) is just the last joke. I thought it was pretty funny, and it's not like the movie asked the audience to take its own universe seriously.

          I actually really love that they had the balls to do that. I mean, three seconds of cutting. That's gotta be deliberate. I don't know, I guess ambiguity can get old.

  What about The Lost Room series. I don't know if I'd call it completely rational fiction, but it does have the same feeling of rationally investigating a world of seemingly inscrutable effects that you get from some rational fanfics, trying to expose the underlying mechanics, and using logic to kind of munchkin around the limitations of different powers and things. Its a good series anyway, so if you watch it and decide its not really rational then you won't feel too bad.

    Good mini-series, even if the protagonist does fall into the "literally nothing matters as much as getting my daughter back" trope. I really wish they'd turned that into a proper series.

  I think Game of Thrones is actually quite rationalist.

  All of the characters have complex backstories and reasons for their actions. It avoids the trope of cackling madman for all of the main characters (and for the supplemental characters, you never see enough of them so it may just be one aspect of their personality).

  The characters act according to their own best interest, and are rarely saved by deus ex machina. All sides define themselves as the good side (and there are certainly more than 2 sides).

  The rules of the world are actually sane and consistant. The reason so many "unknown" magical things are happening is because the world has a high/low magic cycle, where it goes through a period of thousands of years of low magic before going through a few hundred years of high magic. So the lack of knowledge about fundamental rules of their world can be explained by poor record keeping and lack of a true education system.

  Though it does have a significant advantage over other shows. For Game of Thrones, characters have the weight of the book backing up their characters, and many of the examples above are not well portrayed as rationalist in the tv show. But they are well portrayed in the books.

  A second thought (started as another reply to keep the discussion separate):

  Farscape seasons 1-3 are more rationalist than most tv shows. The main character has motivations and actually is extremely out of his depth for most of the show. He lacks knowledge of things that are basic fundamentals for other characters in the show (including not knowing how to brush his teeth with their tools). 

  He tries to use reason to solve his conflict with the Peacekeepers (though they refuse his reasoning due to their different viewpoint).

  How about Avatar: The last airbender series.

  The characters are introduced as typical good/evil, but this is deconstructed through the series into believably complex characters and politics.

  Everything in the plot is character driven, and there are no deus ex flashbacks to retcon character driven causes onto events that seem arbitrary at the time.

  Although its hard to show characters problem solving without an internal monologue, to the extent that its possible the characters get around problems by coming up with plans, working things out and building contraptions. Note: there are also occasional calls to mysticism to fix problems, so its a mixed bag.

  There are only a couple of moments of rational exploration of the magic in the world, and they're heavily laced with the mysticism of the universe, but the rules of the world are for the most part set out explicitly and followed.

  There aren't really any puzzles for the viewer to follow, and there are no description of rationality, but you wouldn't expect that in the medium.

    Well, yes and no. Airbender is one of my favorite shows ever, but about half the main badguys are pretty much just pure sociopath/megamaniacally evil. Which is fine, not every bad guy needs to be complex: some people really are megamanical and sociopaths. But when the MAIN antagonists are, it does detract a bit from the overall story, I think.

    On top of that, the ending was a total deus-ex-machina. Not just Aang getting hit back into the rock in the exact spot that somehow unlocked his Avatar state again and lets him kick Ozai's ass, but also the whole concept and execution of "spirit bending," as cool a concept as it was.

    One of my favorite scenes of whole series was [Aang's conversations with his past selves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol040QSq_kk&channel=PrincessAzulaTV), where he kept asking what he should do about killing Ozai, and they kept responding, indirectly and then directly, about how sometimes you have no choice but to kill.  I actually teared up a little when he was talking to the past air nomad:

    >Yes, all life is sacred...
    >
    >I know, I'm even a vegetarian! I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever, and I've never used violence except in self defense, and certainly never to take a life!
    >
    >Avatar Aang, I know that you are a gentle spirit, and the monks have taught you well. But this isn't about you: this is about the world.
    >
    >But the monks taught me that I have to detach myself from the world so my spirit could be free!
    >
    >Many great and wise air nomads have detached themselves, and attained spiritual enlightenment. But the avatar can never do it, because your sole duty is TO the world. Here is my wisdom for you: selfless duty calls for you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs, and do whatever it takes to protect the world.

    This was a beautiful bit of dialogue, and was incredibly well thought out way to introduce what's usually a family-unfriendly, but still very true, aesop into the show.  Sometimes you just don't have any good choices. Sometimes, a death is the lesser of two evils. And when you're facing an incredibly powerful magic emperor who will never stop until he rules the world in a fight to the death, that's kind of one of those moments (unless you want to cut his arms and legs off, cauterize the wounds, and keep him in a jail cell until he dies of old age, which is really just torture combined with murder). The lion-turtle even said something like "the pure heart can weather the shadow without being consumed by it," which I took to mean "You can kill without being tainted by it if you do it for the right reasons" or some such.

    But, because it ultimately WAS a kid's show, and having the child main character kill the bad guy would have been a no-no, they pulled spiritbending out of nowhere and got a nice and peaceful and happy ending, with no character development or harsh compromises or sacrifices.

    /rant over

    So yeah. I love the show and ultimately agree with you that it's really well written and rational, but it does fall prey to some bad writing tropes, in my view.
    ```

    - u/comport:
      ```
      Yeah, it's a shame they had to [](#s "lionturtle some plothole filler up at the end"), I think the last four episodes are all a little weak in terms of writing and voice acting of incidental characters.

      The [](#s "rock spike in the back") was a bit of an ass-pull, but I also appreciate that someone on the writing team was keeping track of these things and realised that they needed something to do that. I wouldn't necessarily expect a tv series, especially a kids tv series to be so dedicated to continuity.

      Also, spoilers :o

      The lion turtle thing needed to be foreshadowed more, certainly. [LoK Spoilers](#s "Although it is worth noting that killing the villains is very much on the table in the spin-off.") 

      But I would say that Azula and Iroh's characters, and Zuko's inner journey under their influence, are two pretty good examples of different aspects of rationality and the painful process of becoming more rational. And other things, of course.
      ```

  - u/ArisKatsaris:
    ```
    Okay, no. I liked the show, but in no form and shape can I imagine that we can stretch the word "rationalist" in order to include it in that description. A show being *good* and a show being rationalist aren't the same thing by far.

    EDIT: But I guess the original poster asked for just the *most* rationalist show, and since I don't really have any suggestions of my own that I would feel properly qualify for the title, I shouldn't have complained.
    ```

    - u/comport:
      ```
      You made me realise that I probably misread OP.

      I was answering "What's the most rational show" instead of "What's the most rationalist show". I made the assumption since it was on the sub for rational rather than rationalist fiction. TLA is pretty rational, but not at all rationalist.

  house, though not all of it just the professional side, actually uses things like tests and evidence.

    Isn't it usually said that House is basically just Sherlock Holmes, but with medicine.

    - u/zdk:
      ```
      Yes, but Sherlock Holmes (and House) is not really using rationalist methodology either:

      >But when you look at what Sherlock Holmes does - you can't go out and do it at home.  Sherlock Holmes is not really operating by any sort of reproducible method.  He is operating by magically finding the right clues and carrying out magically correct complicated chains of deduction.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems to me that reading Sherlock Holmes does not inspire you to go and do likewise.  Holmes is a mutant superhero.  And even if you did try to imitate him, it would never work in real life.

      Though its worth noting that Arthur Conan Doyle did use 'forensic' science (in the not-quite Holmesian sense) to exonerate two people: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle#Correcting_injustice
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The other problem with Sherlock Holmes is that he lives in a very lawful universe/world and that his laws are always justified (even when they wouldn't normally be). For example, the only reason a watch would be several hours off is because of foreign travel. There's no way you just got the watch and haven't changed it yet. Or your kid played with it. No, foreign travel is the only explanation.
