## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  Not much discussion here, isn't there usually a bit more?

  Anyway, the Chess AI Leela is going to be playing a game against chess GM Andrew Tang. Leela is an open source Chess AI modeled off of Google's Alpha Zero AI and learns by playing millions of games against herself.

    Get hyped guys. I've been following this project since it broke off from Leela Zero. It's amazing how far it's come in just a few months. It was good enough to take a few games against the lowest engine in TCEC while making endgame blunders all the way. The bonus is that it plays much more like a human than previous chess engines, so this will be a very interesting set of games to watch.

  Just a thing I'm curious about - I'm reading "Luminosity", the rational fic rewrite of Twilight by alicorn. Not having read the original work, because, uhm, it's bad and stuff, can anyone tell me how much of the cast, world building etc. is taken from that, and how much is original stuff?

    Uhhh, that does not sound at all like you work for a shady corporation whose experiments will inevitably go awry and end up putting the world in mortal danger...
