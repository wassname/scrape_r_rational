“How to Survive an Argument With a Dragon”
by Dr. Mike Reddy PFHEA (@DoctorMikeReddy) [200 words]
“Tis a simple matter, mortal.” the Dragon sighed. “Pick wisely. The wrong choice means certain death…” The ‘th’ in death was (dramatically?) extended like a snake’s hiss.

Having never seen a real dragon before, this particular mortal examined the wizened face, wondering whether snakes had a common ancestor. From her experience with fossils it seemed unlikely to be dinosaurs.

“And you will not harm me before I’ve made a choice?”

The Dragon nodded. “I wouldst not kill thee afore a choice is made, Mortal.”

“I have a name. Mona Fury.” the mortal cried. Both names recycled from relatives, which annoyed her intensely. Not that this would matter if she didn’t solve the Dragon’s riddle.

“Thou hast two ways ahead to escape the cave. One of fire, one of ice.” the Dragon gestured to each with her free claw. The other, cold and clammy – not snakes then – gripped the caver expertly.

 
“Put me down then.” Mona said calmly. The Dragon lowered and unfurled its claw.

“I choose… not to choose. I’ll make my own way out.”

“Very clever, Human.” the Dragon conceded. Triumphantly, Mona bent to pick up her caving gear.

“Of course, that WAS still a ‘choice’ though, wasn’t it…”

  Literally every single thing Mona has said has been a stupid thing to say. The story as written suggests that she has just wasted her fourth and final chance to talk her way out of this. The dragon just mocked her for giving it permission to kill her and she is going to die in the next two seconds.

  That's fine if this is microfiction. If this is something other than microfiction, then you have failed to convey some relevant information that would be necessary for you to get the response you want. Do you want me to say what Mona should have done? Then I'm basically just writing a completely new story in response to a vague prompt and you framing it as a "challenge" is disingenuous. Do you want me to say how the story should continue? Okay: The dragon wants to take the first excuse to kill Mona that its rules allow. Therefore, unless it is stupid or has motivations that you have not even hinted at, it won't accept take-backs. Mona no longer has any influence over the situation and the only possible next sentence is "GAME OVER." This isn't a scare-quotes "impossible" challenge. This is a challenge that has already been failed, and the screen is already fading to black. Is that your intent?

  ^(Her best option at this point is to shout, "The early modern English verb 'wouldst' is conjugated for second person, you great posturing lout! I bet you're not even 50!" That way she at least takes the dragon's ego down with her.)

  Make the protagonist a bureaucrat instead of a caver.

  "I will choose... after a careful environmental impact assessment of each proposal."

    "After a careful* environmental impact assessment** of each proposal."

    *Timeline for project completion to be set at exactly however much is chosen for one's lifespan; the dragon is obligated to assist in realizing this timeframe to ensure the success of the project.

    **assessment scope is up to the assesser and may extend to and beyond the subatomic and cosmic levels. Adequate breaks from the project, of any length, must be provided as requested.

  A minor quibble, first of all:

  >“I have a name. Mona Fury.” the mortal cried

  This really doesn't sound like 'cried' in my head. Consider either punching up that dialogue with more emotion, or using a different verb.

  As for how she survives:

  The dragon lashes down to try to eat her, and in desperation she throws her backpack into it's open maw. The beast chokes on the bag and is distracted while the caver runs for the icey exit. Firing her flare gun into the floor every once in a while to drive back the chill, she manages to make her way through and to an exit from the cave system.

  I admit I'm probably not very good at this, but i figured I'd take the shot.

  The prompt could do with a rewrite. I'm going to ignore most of the body of this post in the spirit of answering the prompt in a more interesting way.

  She jumped away as a huge claw smashed against rock and looked for a way out.

  Mona had no experience with dragons, and she'd much prefer doing without this one. Before today, they hadn't been real. A PhD in archeology equipped her with endless ways to deal with things that were already dead, which was just how she liked it.

  Unfortunately, while the mini rockslide had carried her into the cave with only minimal bruises and scrapes, the constantly shifting rubble also removed any chance of climbing back out.

  She ran toward the other end of the cave. Escape was out of the picture. Could she distract it? With what? She had gear in her backpack, but the concept of managing to get any of it out before the dragon killed her was ridiculous, without even mentioning the time it would take to set up and use most of it.

  She shot a glance back up at the hole and blinked at the cold light. It was dark down here, darker than she'd expected.

  Maybe she could use that. She scooped up a larger rock that lay in her path, stumbling as she adjusted her grip, then skidded to a dead halt and flung it as far as she could.

  'As far as she could' turned out to be maybe half a dozen paces. Even if she was right and the light had blinded it, the dragon could just swipe a claw through the general area.

  Quickly but quietly she picked up a few smaller fragments of stone and flung one at the area the first rock had landed in. The next landed slightly farther away, and the one after that a little more. When she ran out of rubble in her immediate vicinity she went stock-still.

  The cave was anything but silent. Blood pumped almost as loudly as the ringing in her ears, and the shifting and groaning of rock as something enormous moved its weight all served to put her an inch from panicking. But the dragon hadn't killed her yet.

  She needed something to distract herself with or she'd bolt. Mona turned slowly, carefully. What she saw was dark and confusing. A fragment of an exposed vein of ore glinted here and there, a tangle of confused structures rising up and up and...

  Then the yellow orb blinked, and in that moment everything became clear.

  It could see her just fine. Its entire massive bulk had right there the entire time, and she'd carried on chucking rocks like an idiot.

  But it hadn't killed her. What did it want? Entertainment? Was it like a cat, playing with its prey before slowly killing it? Fictional dragons were often portrayed as intelligent, with some fiction even having them as ancient hoarders of knowledge. And you couldn't hoard knowledge very well if you couldn't communicate.

  "If it's food you want, I can have entire cows flown over here," she said.

  Silence. The stillness stretched out just long enough that'd she'd just started to involuntarily relax before it responded.

  The dragon's voice wasn't very loud, but it penetrated. She felt the vibrations in her bones, in the rock around her.

  "I do not need anything you might possess. You will die."

  It was the sheer, matter-of-fact *weight* of the sentence that chilled her, sapped her of the will to do anything but shiver.

  "Then why keep me alive?" she said.

  It was a terrible question. But she'd had to say *something* or the terror would have frozen her there forever. She had to keep moving or she'd *stop*.

  There was that terrible pause before the dragon spoke again, where she was *sure* she would die any second now, and then—

  "Sometimes intruders say something interesting to me before they die."

  Mona blinked.

  "That's—wait, can I ask you a question?" She took the yawning moment of silence as assent. "What's the last time anyone else came here? Antarctica isn't exactly well-traversed, even in summer."

  "It has been a long time. Enough for uranium-234 to decay to thorium-230."

  A few thoughts went through her head in quick succession. The dragon was somehow translating languages—but that was obvious, there was no way that kind of jaw could make any remotely-human sounds. It knew about radioactive decay. And if she remembered correctly, the half-life for the decay of uranium-234 to thorium-230 was well over a hundred thousand years. Then she shunted all of that to another part of her brain because survival took priority.

  "Other people know where I am."

  "I am losing my patience."

  She sped through the next words. "Our science has advanced a great deal during that time. We can track people anywhere at any time from all the way across the world. And if you kill me, we will kill you. You mentioned uranium—well, we can split it. We have thousands of bombs in storage, and while you might be big, you don't look big enough to survive a nuclear detonation."

  The dragon let her go.

    "They will think you died in the rock slide. Your body will never be found.

    Besides, is I let you go, how do I know that you won't nuke me anyways?"

      ```
      >We can track people anywhere at any time from all the way across the world.

      No getting lost in a rockslide for her!

      And yeah, the last line is just the eventual conclusion. Assume the discussion continues a bit longer. It was getting longer than I wanted to be so I cut it short.

      "And you honestly think that humanity won't ever discover you?  You may be able to hide from the search parties sent after me, but this continent becomes less remote every year.  Can you hide from the geologists who will scour every inch of this land for valuable resources?  Governments often hide assets here; information sought after by their rivals.  What will you do when it becomes economical for militaries to keep the entire continent under ground-penetrating surveillance?"

      "You're going to have to deal with us eventually, and the sooner the better. We're close to creating self-improving artificial general intelligence- we might do it within decades.  Right now, you can outsmart and overawe us, but that won't last forever.  Every year you wait, your ability to influence the outcome of your inevitable meeting with civilization slips away."

      "Here's what I propose: hire me.  I'll work for a percentage of your future earnings, which we can work out later.  I will bring evidence of your existence to investors, and use that money to found a corporation dedicated to developing a strategy for introducing you to society that will minimize public backlash, ensure that your legal rights are recognized, prevent your exploitation by powerful interests, and build a brand."

      "Once everything is in place, you can make a fortune just from public appearances, and a larger fortune by auctioning exclusive access to information about yourself, your history and biology to governments."

      "With that money, which will grow exponentially over centuries, you can influence the development of human civilization in a way that ensures your long-term safety.  Instead of an unknown threat in a conveniently bomb-able wasteland, you can be a part-owner of civilization, protected and pampered beneath a city by the same humans or post-humans who might otherwise seek your destruction or exploitation."

      "And on top of all that, I just have to ask... aren't you a bit bored?"

  Mona eeped, and straightened. "Well, no, if just saying that counted as a choice, then it would be a self-contradicting incoherent sentence, and if uttering an incoherent sentence were a choice you would've killed me after what I said when I first saw you."

  "'twas indeed a vile oath," chuckled the Dragon. "Very well. Only a logically coherent stated choice, if wrong, will result in your death...but so will a choice declared implicitly through action. Should you try to leave, then shall you be eaten, unless it be through the correct path."

  "And that path is either fire or ice, but not both?"

  "I'm pretty sure I said that already," grumbled the great creature.

  Mona stood in uffish thought. She needed a way to exploit these rules to extract, literally, a bit of information. But the only way the Dragon was bound to communicate was to either kill, or not kill her, which was not a particularly helpful communication channel. Her best hope was that it seemed clear the Dragon hadn't thought all this through, and was making up the rules as it went along.

  "But what makes it the 'correct' path?" she asked innocently.

  The Dragon's horse-size throat glowed impossibly with suppressed fire. "Should thou choose it, thou shalt have my word that thou wilt pass through it unharmed."

  So close..."Sorry, I don't quite understand your English when it gets like that. You're saying that if I choose the correct path, you'll promise me out loud that I'll be safe, and if I choose the wrong path you'll kill me?"

  "Yessssss...."  a long, drawn out hiss, that faded so slowly Mona could believe it would be decades in finishing.

  "Okay, then I choose to pass down the path of fire and have you not kill me."

  The Dragon started to rise up in terrible triumph, its jaws unclenching, then paused, and somehow contrived to look thoughtful. If the path of fire wasn't "correct", this wasn't a coherent choice by the Dragon's rules, so it had no right to kill her. And if it was "correct", the Dragon was bound to make her a verbal promise.

  "Rather, I choose to pass down the path of ice and have you not kill me."

  The Dragon settled down, its fire fading. Its voice was suddenly sleepy. "Go, then, thou shalt pass with safety, clever one."

  Mona bent to pick up her pack, then again straightened up without it. "Wait," she said. She was an explorer after all. "Now that you've promised not to kill me, I do have some questions..."

  Hmm... Either this is either a real riddle with a true answer, or a fake riddle, where the dragon will try to claim that my choice is wrong regardless of what I say. 

  A real riddle can be solved, with or without additional info from the dragon. A fake riddle would basically be a verbal fencing match against the dragon. 

   I would start with "Will you answer additional questions about the decision, or must I face this decision with the information I currently have?"
  ```

- u/wren42:
  ```
  is it meant to be so vague?  what do the paths of ice and fire consist of, or is it up to us to decide what the obstacles are?

- u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
  ```
  I don't think there's a right or rational answer to this type of situation, when you find yourself at the mercy of the whims of an powerful being you know nothing about. After all, every single action you could take could be considered offensive and get you killed. Stay silent? The dragon thinks you're ignoring it and kills you for the insult. Talk at the wrong time? The dragon thinks you're disrespecting it and kills you. Try to munchkin its words? The dragon is enraged by your games and kills you. Run away? The dragon thinks you're playing tag and hunts you down and kills you.

  Especially with something as inhuman as a dragon, you can't even do cold reading on it since its facial expressions and body language could be completely different from a human's. A smile could mean aggression instead of happiness. A glare could mean happiness instead of rage. There's no way to know unless you luckily and blindly fumble into a course of action that lets you stay alive long enough to learn what makes the dragon tick.

  Mona leaves the cavern using the path through which she entered.

  After a moment the dragon calls out to her but receives no response. "Good. I thought she'd never leave." it mumbles as it curls into a comfortable coil and goes back to sleep.

  Really though, the prompt isn't very good as a challenge. It doesn't establish a goal for Mona or the dragon, and otehr than the vaguely defined "spelunking gear" doesn't list any assets for either side to use to achieve their undefined goals.
