## [META] What ebook formats, and does anyone care?

### Post:

In the publishing of [Magical Creatures](http://sadehall.tumblr.com/), I've now had a couple of requests for an ebook format, and I'm trying to decide if this is worth doing, but am myself not an ebook user and so have no idea what's current/convenient for people, or if everyone's just reading the site on their phone anyway.

Anyone have thoughts on this?

  [Wikipedia says:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats)

  > The EPUB format is the most widely supported vendor-independent XML-based (as opposed to PDF) e-book format; that is, it is supported by the largest number of e-Readers, including Amazon Kindle Fire (but not standard Kindle).

  [ArchiveOfOurOwn](http://archiveofourown.org/) allows users to download stories in the MOBI, EPUB, PDF, and HTML formats.

  [FIMFiction](http://www.fimfiction.net) allows users to download stories in the TXT, HTML, and EPUB formats.

  When necessary, I use [Sigil](https://github.com/Sigil-Ebook/Sigil/releases) to convert HTML files to EPUB files. When possible, I use [Cool Reader](https://sourceforge.net/projects/crengine) to read EPUB files on my computer, phone, and (rarely) Nook device.

  Note that PDF is *totally different* from HTML/EPUB and MOBI. For most literature, the fixed layout of PDF is inferior to the dynamic layout of the other formats.

  Serious ebook users use calibre. It auto translates from any format to any format. So it largely doesn't matter.

    I'd say I qualify as one of the aforementioned "serious ebook users", and I absolutely *hate* having to turn PDFs into EPUBs (though Calibre is indeed the tool to use for this). Going from non-reflowable text (pdfs) to reflowable text (ebooks) is much more difficult that changing reflowable text formats, so I'm always very appreciative when content producers put out ebooks instead of just PDFs. 

    I'd say go with EPUB because it's the open standard for ebooks. The only reason ebooks ever come in other formats is when platforms like amazon have their own proprietary format or for DRM purposes which still wont stop anyone who knows what they're doing.

    That said, some people really like pdfs for whatever reason, even when the content is just text without any fancy formatting, so though I personally stay away from pdfs when possible, it wouldn't do to ignore the pdf-people.

    How do you handle epub to pdf conversions? They turn out terrible for me with a waaaay too big font size.
    ```

    - u/Terkala:
      ```
      The settings in the "pdf output" option that appears when you select PDF output lets you choose font size. It defaults to 20px (which is pretty big), so I'd suggest 14 pt.

      Calibre has a ton of options, so it's easy to miss.

  To reach the largest number of people, I recommend having the story in epub, mobi, pdf, and html since they are the most frequently used formats.

  However, I don't know how you can set Lyra's perspective to the right like you do online in an epub/mobi format.

  ```
  When I read offline (on a Kobo Mini), I use Calibre to translate almost any format to Epub. (PDF is the one format that I've had trouble with.) Any ebooks that are already available in Epub save me a step.
  ```

  Calibre is definitely the way to go, as others have mentioned. It also has a command line interface, so it's easily scriptable.
  ```

  ```
  .mobi is the easiest for Kindle users, which is the majority e-reader.
  ```

- u/seylerius:
  ```
  I'm going to add to the chorus of "EPUB" here, with a couple additions: many people appreciate the ability to read EPUBs in whatever color scheme they choose. The typical mechanisms of this are twofold: either their reader simply ignores the bundled CSS, or the reader overrides the colors manually. The former is meaningfully more common. What this means to you, is that someone trying to avoid the glowy pink & grey will also likely lose the part of the stylesheet that right-aligns Lyra's text and left-aligns the nameless narrator. You may wish to have an array of EPUBs matching the available display options.
