  I'm a little disappointed by the "everything was Norman's plan" reveal. I would have liked to see Emma step up and take the reins in his absence, instead of continuing to act as his subordinate.

    I would have liked that too, but Emma's personality and handling isn't scheming- it's sympathy and people, getting them to work with her and trust her. She's the emotional and moral backbone of the group.

    Norman the chessmaster, and Ray the cold and cunning hyper-intelligent individual. It's a good character dynamic in my opinion, although I would have liked to see more original and practical ideas from Emma specifically even if the overarching plan wasn't necessarily hers. 

    Though bringing the others in on it was her idea, I think.

      You're right--I missed that on my first reading. It does look like that was something she thought of on her own and suggested to Norman. I still wish she had been more of an active participant, but I'm glad that she was able to contribute to the planning in a way that aligns with her own unique perspective and skillset.

  "Wtf. They told all these kids and no one cracked and now everyone's going along? How unrealistic."

  And then I saw the final page. And felt slightly chastened.
