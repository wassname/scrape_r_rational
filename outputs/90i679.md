  Gabriel is by far my favorite viewpoint character. Realistically flawed but aware of his own faults, has gone through quite a lot of personal growth over the course of the series, has an interesting and diverse fighting style, and is generally just funny/sassy. He was absolutely terrified last chapter, and managed to work up the courage here to confirm that his special scythe does not in fact kill gods.

  Fross is second best, in large part because she complained about being stereotyped as an exposition fairy early on, claiming those aren't a real thing, before making it her full time job to be a fairy that spouts exposition.

  I'm glad that the story has narrowed its focus onto a smaller cast of characters. I did find following Darling interesting, and the enforcer dude with the rest of Justinian's suicide squad was somewhat entertaining, but I don't think we needed to follow the new freshman group, and cutting down on side chapters makes the plot go much faster. The sophomore class should retain the spotlight, because they are the most interesting characters in the story, along with Tellwryn.

  A little closer to figuring out what Elilial's beef with the Pantheon is.

  Izara also didn't contradict her regarding what Toby and Triss were likely to do once they found out the truth, which suggests that it was something fairly morally repugnant, albeit probably necessary from the Pantheon's perspective.

    My money's on some sort of mass human sacrifice to fuel their apotheosis.

      Maybe! That would be suitably abhorrent.

      I only think it might not be that because, supposedly (I don't recall which character noted this, so I might be wrong), they set out to just take down the Infinite Order, and they ascended accidentally, even unwillingly in a some cases.

      From context, I think whatever happened was after they became gods and the Elder Wars ended.

      I may be misremembering, but I thought it was something that the pantheon did after achieving godhood. Elial was a god for a while before defecting, so it would be odd if she spent a couple hundred years mulling it over before making a decision.

  So seeing Vesk in this chapter it occurs to me that with a great doom coming the god of stories is very much someone to be concerned about.

  I don't really think this qualifies as rational, uh, at all. Every book we get stuff happening just because teh plot demands it, The characters do not solve problems through the intelligent application of their knowledge and resources, and the fictional world has does not have consistent rules. No matter how you slice it, this just really doesn't fit.
  ```

  - u/LapisLightning:
    ```
    I mean, that argument could be made for half the stories posted here (A Practical Guide to Evil especially). What are your gripes with TGAB, I for one can't see how the rules of the world are inconsistent for one.

      Leavign aside the retcons, like when they swapped the fundemental mechanics of magic from the whole "Mind interfacing with reality" (which I don't think was an bad move fromt he story perspective, since that was dumb, but is a very clear example of this)? 

      There's how  much magical power constantly changes from scene to scene as the biggest offender imo. The story *cannot* make up its mind on that; Tellwyrn is so strong the empire's strategy is to leave her alone! But she always backs down from conflicts with them because they're too strong from her! But we can't afford to piss her off! But let's do that! 

      Paladins are also a huge offender with this. Trissany is an incredibly powerful warrior, as long as it's not mid plot, at which point her skills vanish and she hasn't won a fight since, like book two or so. Toby is the reverse of this, in which he's a pacifist up until he's a martial artist that never loses in combat situations, and then reverses at a moments notice. Mostly this part is overshadowed by the narration lying, though, particularly since the two are usually entwined.
      ```

  ```
  I'm wondering if the great doom is the predestined arrival of humans from the dominant culture that the Last Order were trying to get away from. They could probably turn off some version of the transcension fields, and all you'd get left would be charismatic paladins and elves who would have to eat real food.
