## In LITRPG stories where real life turns into a game and raising intelligence actually makes the protagonist smarter, why would they bother with physical stats?

### Post:

In most role-playing video games INT governs magical power, as opposed to STR which governs physical power. If we assume that there's no difference other than aesthetics between a punch(STR) and an energy bolt(int) then it wouldn't really matter which stat you increase. Punch the bad guy into paste or throw a ball of lightening at him, two widely different approaches but same end result.

But if we take into consideration the real meaning behind the stats, if Int actually made you smarter, wouldn't it have double the benefit? why would you put points into STR which raises your fighting capability when INT does EXACTLY the same thing but also makes you smarter?

  1. INT may not actually make you smarter, it may be an abstract measure of magic power or efficiency.
  2. In games, raising stats typically costs exponentially more EXP as the stat goes up.
  3. In games, raising stats may be cheaper at lower levels.
  4. INT based attacks may use up mana points, while you can do STR based attacks all day.
  5. Old school D&D style games explicitly limit you to a certain number of spells per day.

    I realize it widely depends on the system, but don't forget that the theme in all of these stories is life turning into a classic rpg game, not something completely random, and the protagonist can usually gather easily whether or not INT makes them smart/improve magical power- by the game overlay and a little bit of testing.

    It's like supply and demand- a very crude economic model that wouldn't perfectly apply to every real life situation but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be taken into consideration.

    Obviously someone new to the situation wouldn't have all the data, but the moment they realize that:

    1.INT raises your "firepower"( fighting capability)
    2. INT actually makes you smarter.

    They should invest everything into INT until further information is revealed.

      Smarter is fairly relative though.
      Some stories make int make you better at calculations. Not an insignificant skill, but hardly game breaking.
      Maybe it increases your memory. but at what percentage memory are you willing to accept?
      ```

        Yeah this is sort of comparable to superintelligence in regards to AI. There's _qualitative_ superintelligence and then there's other mental boosts like: memory, thinking speed, self control/ability to control one's own mind and potentially the ability to split one's mind into multiple subagents.
        ```

      If the system comes with a manual (which it usually does in these fics) they don't have to wait for more info.

      If the system is game balanced, it won't have a single killer stat. If there's an obvious "raise INT" strategy then it's not balanced, and the author of the fic has set up a straw system to put their mary-sue in.

      2-5 are common ways to balance the game, and any balanced game will likely have one or more of them.

        My experience with these fics is that they're almost always depicting games which have been balanced to assume that INT is a stat of the *character avatar*, as operated by a merely-human-level player. Then, separately, there's something else going on *outside* of the game, as part of the narrative conceit, that unifies the player with the character, thus making the INT stat *also* translate to increased intellect. My impression is that the games-as-designed don't usually take this unification into account in their balance.

        One piece of evidence I have for this, is that although many characters in litRPG worlds have magic powers commensurate with boosted INT, I've never read a litRPG where any character *other than the protagonist* has the sort of intellectual capacity you'd get by boosting INT in a game where INT controls that. It's only ever the protagonist that gets this effect, if it happens, because it's only the protagonist that isn't "from" the game.

        Which is too bad; I'd love to read a litRPG where the protagonist is a permanent "merely human", brought to a fantastical world but not governed by stat-progression rules, who instead notices that everyone *else* is governed by stat-progression rules, and so sets out to [raise](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RaisingSim) an NPC party member into a God. The protagonist would be Watson, building their own Sherlock Holmes.

          That... would actually be a very interesting story.

  You're making a lot of assumptions about the game system. The game could, for example, compensate for the difference between intelligence and strength. In a lot of game systems, intelligence starts out really really weak, and exceeds strength only later on, and that's the primary difference.

  If you start out assuming that the difference is only aesthetic and that they are of equal power all the time, you're letting your assumptions dictate the entire course of the argument.

  By principle? Yes, INT is more valuable. But there are quite a few problems with your perspective:

  * What's the balance of the game? Are mages actually any good, or are they pathetic glass cannons shattered by indestructible tanks?
  * Do you have magics that you can munchkin? Complex systems to optimize? Trusting or rational people to easily manipulate/convince? Imagine landing in a low-fantasy prehistoric setting. Not much to do there but fight.
  * You stand in front of a werewolf, magic ran out and he doesn't listen to reason. Do you still put your points in INT at that moment? Safety is not something you'll have to be given.
  * Do other stats come with their own special benefits? STR allowing *muscle wizardry*? END making you immune to magics?
  * Is high INT even safe in this game? High INT may not prepare you emotionally for whatever insights you gain. If you see all mages are insane, then it's a clear warning sign.

    A set of homebrewed D&D spells I found a while back came at this from an unusal angle. It was a set of offensive divinations that would, for example, tell a terrible secret to the target. They'd have to make a check against it, where they were penalised for *higher* int, to try to avoid understanding it, and if they succeeded (in understanding it) they'd instantly die.

  Raising mental stats like INT and WIS are explicitly editing your mind - depending on the perspective of the character, they may consider this to be a form of personality death, with a new, smarter version of themselves essentially taking over their lives.

  Bonus existential crisis points if the character only realises this after they've raised their mental stats high enough for the possibility to occur to them.

    Oooh, that's like the idea someone came across in /r/parahumans (or maybe /r/wormfanfic) where shards actually turn you into a meat puppet and simulate you in the shard. That's why Shadow Stalker can retain "her" memories when she changes phase.
    ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    Thinking that improving your intelligence would result in personality death strikes me as a basically impossible position to hold.                   
    After all it would imply that you are dying _all the freaking time_ without any "special" means of altering your mind. Whether from maturation, intelligence increases (if the protagonist is a teenager with some neural development ahead of them), or just from their mind being temporarily altered by tiredness, drugs, or any number of other things. There would also be no way even in principle to assess whether a given change would be enough to count as death.

    Of course I generally have my own issues with identity change being too conflated with proper "oblivion" death since from an internal perspective they wouldn't resemble each other. Having your personality forcibly altered can be terrifying all on its own without trying to insist it's the same as having your brains blown out.

  Why would you put anything in INT when endurance makes you live longer?

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  Highly depends on the system. In the popular RWBY fanfic, The Games We Play, the main character has a similar mindset and gets great results.
  ```

- u/narfanator:
  ```
  In real life, there are a lot of connections between physical health and mental capabilities; particularly endurance. The brain is not what gives you energy.

  If there's two things I could tell myself a decade ago, it'd be to lift weights and buy bitcoins.

  Intelligence is more valuable in the long term, but physical strength can be much more valuable in the short term. Say, when you're actually involved in the fights you need to win to get more levels.

  ```
  Probably a history of being a physical weakling — STR 8 or lower.
  ```

  - u/Chosen_Pun:
    ```
    Alternately, and this is the snarky answer to the question as stated, a character who was already specced toward STR might not have enough INT to consider INT worthwhile.
    ```

- u/anewhopeforchange:
  ```
  Strength is used for more then just fighting you need to carry stuff or do things. Endurance/stamina is useful in long fights or any activity that takes a while.

  It's kinda like real life. Why would anyone work out instead of reading a book.

  Seeing as I wrote a fiction in which the main character is integrated into a digital world and is trying to become a 'Digital' (essentially an AI), I had to handle this.

  The basic way I handled the issue is that the protagonist has lots of traits he is trying to raise, focused around his mind, but 'int' isn't one of them. he has 'short term memory' and things like that. It all combines together to make who he is. The *physical stats* aren't even shown for him. For this exact reason. They just don't really matter to him, his focus is on his mental stats and more importantly how he views and interacts with the world, his long term perception and planning around the world.

  ... Author practicality. Being a successful author requires you to have a fair chunk of int. Otherwise, keeping plot straight and writing believable characters just does not work. But a gamer character who min-maxes for smarts will - given that gamer setups are nigh-universally wish-fulfillment setups, in short order be not only "Very clever", but "Terrence Tao". Very few plots are going to survive that, and writing it believably is absurdly hard.

- u/EthanCC:

  It depends entirely on the specifics of the system...there could be some limit on how many spells you could cast (as in almost every RPG) or there could be a soft cap, where diminishing returns make putting further points into a stat useless. This seems to be the case in most litrpgs...if only because we rarely see increasing INT actually leading to better decision making (I know, that's to do with the writing). Of course, there isn't any reason for reality to be balanced, but in a world that follows RPG logic it's likely that there's something odd going on to make it that way.

  &nbsp;

  And if increasing INT actually made you smarter, the world would either be ruled by immortal superintelligences or there would be thousands of shadowy conspiracies of said intelligences pulling in thousands of directions. Which would be an incredible setting, if hard to write.
