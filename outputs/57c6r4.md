## [RST] Naruto: The Need to Become Stronger. Advice needed!

### Post:

Story Synopsys: Even with the world’s most powerful daemon in your stomach, saving the world is not that easy. Any young ninja wishing to survive to fulfil his ambitions must first learn that some problems can't be solved with chakra alone, and that battles are decided by the time swords are drawn, not when they are sheathed. And just as the most important skill is the ability to remain hidden, the most frightening foe is one with the wisdom to hide in Darkness…  
&nbsp;

The prologue can be found [here](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/10/12/the-need-to-become-stronger/).  
&nbsp;

Hey all! I have now written the first 300 pages of The Need to Become Stronger, an ambitious rationalist Naruto fanfic that aims to create a more rational version of the Naruto universe in the same way that HPMoR did for Harry Potter. I personally think it might be really good, but I’m not quite sure how to go about promoting this and making it available to as many readers as possible, so I would love some advice!  
•	Which sites should I post it to? Fanfiction.net and space battles are both popular, but are there any limits to what I can post where or should I just put it up all over the place?   
•	How does the website look? Any advice on customizing it?  
•	Are there any people, especially other writers, who’d like to help me out by giving feedback? I’m not quite satisfied with chapters 2-5 especially, which I’m using as an excuse to procrastinate, so I’d be very grateful to anyone who wants to beta-read those chapters!  
•	How is the Prologue? Please do let me know if it does not flow well or if it’s boring or…anything!  
&nbsp;

The story is written to be accessible even for those with very little knowledge of the Naruto lore.  
&nbsp;

Here is the first paragraph of the story, just to tempt lazy people into downloading the prologue:  
&nbsp;

>Konoha burned.  
&nbsp;

>There was an inferno raging in the heart of the Leaf Village, a fire and yet more than fire, a conflagration that burned with more than heat alone. A creature of living flame was rampaging there, a force of nature shaped like a gigantic fox that dwarfed even the tallest building. Its breath was like the fumes of a furnace that scorched the air itself, and with each sweep of its nine smouldering tails wooden structures were scattered to the winds like burning matchsticks. Ash and smoke and crimson embers filled the acrid air, and the light of its flames outshone that of the full moon above, basking the once-peaceful village in an orange glow like a setting sun. The name given to this monster of legends was Kyūbi, the Nine-tailed Daemon Fox, and it was the greatest and most dreaded of the nine Tailed Beasts that had ravaged the world since time immemorial…

    I guess this is a case of Your Mileage May Vary. I actually quite liked the prologue for its style, as well as the fact that Ibiki knew about Danzo's right eye. In a village where the Hyuga lived, I never quite understood how he managed to keep all his enhancements so secret. 

    The style of the story is, to me, refreshing. The dramatic prose is different from what I'm used to reading on this sub, in a nice way. The lines, dialogue, the descriptions... it gives the distinct impression that I'm reading a Naruto rational fanfic, not just any old rational story. It's unique, and it would be shame for it got away. 

    As for starting with the Kyubi attack; I think that's pretty much fine , as long as you follow up on the changes to the story we've seen here. The higher ups have known what Danzo's been doing for a while now it seems; the Third has also been alerted to the fact that the Kyubi's attack was not a natural event and, perhaps more important to the next few chapters, the Fourth sealed the Fox into Naruto in secret. 

    The only way I could really see this prologue disapoint me is if in chapter one we get to see the classic scenario of all the villager's hating Naruto because of the fox. Why would they know? Why would the Third tell people, after the Fourth went through all that trouble? 

    And also, of course, people know about Danzo, and the Third knows about The Enemy. I'm interested in how you'll show how the village is different from canon, given these changes.

      I hadn't said this yet, but thanks a lot for taking the time to explain what you like about the story! The rational community has a common pitfall where [everyone lines up to say what could be done better, but keep quiet when they are positive](http://lesswrong.com/lw/3h/why_our_kind_cant_cooperate/). Sometimes it's great see a comment that is purely positive, just to be reminded that some people are happy with something as it is, which can provide even more motivation to finish and improve the story. 

      So again, thank you!

    >Going to be very critical because that's generally better than being nice. 

    Sure is! Thanks for taking the time to write a long analysis.

    >You're trying to come off as epic or mythic, but it doesn't work. 

    Good news - only the prologue is written in this style, so the rest of the story should be more enjoyable for you.

    Anyway, other people have said the exact opposite, so I'm guessing this is a case of personal preference. Still, I do worry that maybe I'm scaring off potential readers by having the first chapter with such thick prose. I'll probably just tone it down a bit here and there...

    >The entire prologue changes nothing. Almost the same result as canon, with nothing different except a battle scene with Minato, that is, frankly, not too exciting.

    This is a much more worrisome criticism! The chapter certainly should not be boring, and I thought it did change a few relevant things. I'll have to see if anyone else feels the same way before I make any radical changes.

  [Archive of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/) is probably one of the best sites to upload fiction on- easy download links, easy reviewing, nice format. As for the website you are currently on, the text seems fine, if a little close for my tastes. Certainly an interesting start to a story.

  If you post it on spacebattles, never mention the word rational or rationalist, and take any mention of those words off of your website. They're receptive to rational and rationalist ideas and plots, but have an intense hatred for anything explicitly labelled as such. As long as you never actually use the word or do quote anything that would show that you are affiliated with the rationalist tribe, you should be fine.

    Why?

      I'm not sure. I think it mostly grew out of a hatred of Eliezer Yudkowsky and HPMOR. However, their bias in incredibly strong. They reacted very poorly to Eaglejarl's Team Anko when he posted it, going so far as to invent reasons to dislike it. They interpreted everything in the worst possible light, and were utterly incapable of constructive criticism, or really anything besides flaming and insulting the author.

        It really was amazing how much vitriol I caught for that. Which is a shame, because I had gotten motivated to rewrite it -- polish the writing a bit, improve the ending, etc. That got 86ed pretty fast after the third or fourth page of hate. 

        So, yes, definitely avoid the words "rational" or "rationalist" on SpaceBattles. More generally though, I would suggest just avoiding SpaceBattles. The community has not impressed me and they've got hair-trigger mods with no sense of humor and no willingness to back down / lose face if they make a mistake. SufficientVelocity.com, on the other hand, has been the exact opposite. We've been over there almost a year now and I've been reading a fair amount of other fic on the site. I've seen mod text exactly once and it was applied very appropriately and minimally -- just a "hey, everyone cool down" instead of banhammers and infraction points.

          I have noticed a different character to the Sufficient Velocity community. I don't think it would have been possible to run Marked for Death on Spacebattles. It would have been overrun. Marked for Death is literally labelled as "A Rational Naruto Quest," and I don't think I've ever seen someone wander in and insult everyone there, which is honestly what I would expect on Spacebattles.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            That's actually part of why it's not there. When we started Marked for Death we talked about where to host it. I had just gone through the Team Anko drama and voted against SB or we might have tried it there. As you say, I doubt it would have gone well.

        As a spacebattler, I really enjoyed HPMOR for the first 3/4 of the story. It's gotten kind of boring lately and Team Anko is fantastic.

          Thank you, I appreciate the compliment.

      They don't, entirely, but there's a bad stigma attached because most of the initially-posted rationalist stories were shit, because people tried to use rationality as an excuse to avoid writing well. For most people its not an immediate hatred, but it's sadly become something of a warning sign. This story isn't anywhere near as bad as they were, but it's not good enough that people will overcome their bias.

  My first few comments:

  Writing 300 pages is really impressive, especially when the prologue shows good writing quality. Big kudos for that. That said, writing 300 pages and THEN asking for concrit is going to be much less effective than asking earlier, and comes off as a bit disingenuous. I doubt you will get nearly as much response as you might have gotten otherwise. 

  Speaking of disingenuous, it seems incongruous when you make comments about "where should I post this" in which you suggest you're going to post it everywhere, immediately followed by "can someone help motivate me to post it?" If you actually are serious about needing help, then simply put the whole thing in a zip file and put the link up. Fewer people will go to the trouble of downloading, unzipping, and reading, but some will and the response should help push you into posting individual chapters. 

  When you advertise your story, avoid saying things like "it has intelligent characters and ... awesome fight scenes" and "I suspect it of being amazing." That's for the reader to decide, and it sounds like you're bragging. The kind of authors who brag on their work don't tend to be the kind that produce high quality work. (Actually, in my experience that's true of people in general, not just authors.)

  The rest is written as I'm reading through the story:

  The mythic tone at the beginning was pretty over the top, but it worked well for a few paragraphs of introduction, and the story steadied down quickly after that. Overall, nice effect. 

  You're very clearly writing anime; the dialogue has that style ("why don't you lift up that bandage and show us your right eye?") and the giant ball of explosion was very obviously modeled on an anime trope image.  This isn't a bad thing, but you should be aware that it's visible. 

  For a story that claims to be rational, there seems to be some ball-dropping going on. For example:

  - Danzo says "the Uchiha can control the Beast with their Sharingan", then Ibiki announces that Danzo has a Sharingan...and no one reacts at all. The entire issue is just instantly dropped, and not even Ibiki continues to push it. I would have expected something like "hang on, you have a Sharingan? Leaving aside how the hell you have a Sharingan, can you control that monster and make it stop killing everyone?"  

  - This bit: "Minato frowned. His first instinct had been to check on the location of Uchiha Fugaku, head of the Uchiha clan and leader of the Konoha Military Police Force, but that was meaningless since the shrewd man was able to use Shadow clones; they would find him with the refugees either way." Distinguishing between a shadow clone and a real person is trivial: punch them. If they pop, they were a clone. 

  A couple of minor points: 
  - In canon, Minato summons toads, not frogs. Is that a deliberate change?
  - "irresponsive" is a word, but I had to look it up to know that. I have literally never heard it before and assumed that it was a mistake and you meant "unresponsive". Word choice matters, and it's typically better to choose more standard usage, as doing otherwise knocks the reader out of the flow of the story.  I say this out of personal experience -- I've gotten a large number of reviews telling me that I obviously meant "the army *infested* the town", not "...invested..." or "the genin *polished* up the weapons their teacher had thrown" instead of "...policed up...."

  I was confused by the ending. The Third tells us that when Minato and his Anbu attacked they scared off the person who was controlling the Kyuubi and the Beast had been "irresponsive ever since". We are then shown the Kyuubi tied down, controlled by hundreds of genjutsu, etc. That makes it sound like the ninja defeated it. I guess maybe what happened is that the thing froze and then everyone tied it down? 

  On that subject, you state at the end that "a hundred different genjutsu effects left [the Kyuubi] helpless", yet then immediately tell us that genjutsu hadn't worked on it during the battle because Kushina was dead. Which is it?

  Given that your ending is "This is the story of Naruto Uzumaki" I find myself not holding out a lot of hope that the dangling plot threads (Danzo, the investigation into Madara, etc) will be resolved. I would have liked it if you'd continued straight ahead and showed us the fallout from the attack -- the Third resuming office, the cleanup, etc. That wouldn't be Naruto's story, though. My expectation based on the fact that it is named as such is that the next chapter is going to start with canon -- that Danzo is still around, everyone has dropped the ball on looking into who caused the attack, etc. If you actually have people behave sensibly based on the information you've allowed them to deduce then the world will be completely different. Canon was shaped the way it was because everyone thought the Kyuubi assault was a natural disaster, not a targeted attack. Given that you've let Minato deduce what actually happened, everything should look different. No more Danzo, no more Root, no Uchiha massacre, probably no kidnapping of Hinata and death of Hizashi. That would be a bold and exciting choice, and I hope it's what you do.  

  With all of the above said, I'll read more if you put it up.  I'm curious to see where you go with it.
