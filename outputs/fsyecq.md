  *sigh*

  Previously at the end of the last chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Red!"

  Beginning of current chapter: "Ugh, it's not a Red chapter. Who cares about Blue? I just want to get to Red already!"

  End of current chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Blue!"

  Beginning of the next chapter: "Ugh, it's not a Blue chapter. Who cares about Leaf? I just want to get to Blue already!"

  End of the next chapter: "I can't wait to find out what happens next to Leaf!"

  Having three protagonists is doing wonders for your story with the interweaving natures of Blue's, Red's, and Leaf's coming-of-age journey/self-discovery, but at the end of every chapter, I'm tormented with the *need* to find out what happens next to that person and have to wait at least 3 chapters to find out!

      It's all good! Just like how hunger is the best spice for a meal, the anticipation in your story makes it a lot better and enjoyable to read.

  >He’d missed his chance at a vulpix yesterday, but got a houndour just before they broke for camp instead, which he’s definitely satisfied with.

  Is this a nod to version exclusivity in the games? Very cheeky, if so!

  Also, I was racking my brain trying to think of what the new pokemon could be, and was definitely thrown off by Blue and co.'s guesses. But then I finally thought of >!porygon, which would make total sense. Blue's list of prizes lines up with the games, so it would make sense for porygon to be the big prize. And it fits Silph's claim of stolen goods, as they invented porygon.!< If my guess is correct, I'm very interested in seeing how it plays into the story, as it's one of my favorite 'mons!

  - u/shankarsivarajan:
    ```
    I don't think it's intended to be a secret that it's porygon. That's straight out of the games.

  Hey everyone, welcome back. Hope you’re all staying as safe as you can, and that the chapter helps pass some social-distancing time pleasantly. Until next month, take care of yourselves, and each other.

  Ah, great chapter. The specialization in "status effects" of both kinds is also really clever.

  Is the "Auctoritas, Potestas and Imperium" distinction of kinds of status something you believe and are trying to transmit, or just something you've made Erika believe?

  > "Isn't the gym a bit cultish?" Lizzy asks, seeming a bit nervous. "I heard they have to sit around in circles where you can say whatever you want to each other and the other person has to accept it, and all the members get in relationships with each other all at the same time

  I feel oddly called out :P

    >Is the "Auctoritas, Potestas and Imperium" distinction of kinds of status something you believe and are trying to transmit, or just something you've made Erika believe?

    It's a model of social power that seems useful in a descriptive sense. I think there are natural "joints" between power from status/law/personal power, for example, and so the Roman's framework makes sense to me.

    >I feel oddly called out :P

    Hopefully Erika put some of that worry to rest ;)

      I love the random yet fascinating lessons you sprinkle in.  After the last couple chapters I actually ordered the book on Focusing that you mentioned (thought it'll take 3 weeks for Amazon to deliver it, boo!).

        Glad to hear you've been enjoying them :) I'm a therapist and occasional teacher, so this story kind of lets me engage both those skills!

  Caught up in chapters recently and I can see that I'm going to experience withdrawal symptoms every month. Have to say that this story became remarkably good from what I considered to be shaky beginnings.

  There seems to be a deliberate tension in this chapter between the strict and the permissive that I found very effective. I was expecting hippies and got lectured on Roman civil ideas about power by a kimono-wearing Japanese Pokemon gym leader who makes her own possibly mind-altering bayleef tea. Hope she keeps being oddly normal.

  u/DaystarEld, Do you think you can find time to make a concise list of the main influences (of any kind) on this story, especially on the main characters? I remember Dawkins being quoted by Red. I get the feeling that many of the ideas presented so far have gone over my head because I'm unfamiliar with the cultures and people behind them.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Hmm, yeah, something like a resource list for the story would probably be useful :)

      \+100 Would love to see that!

  Great work as usual!

  >At 29 she's the youngest member in the Indigo League, and he remembers being star-struck by her the last time they met.

  This is playing a bit of a ruckus with my mental model of gym leaders' ages, though. Wasn't it said in one of Mewtwo's chapters that Sabrina was a teenager when he awakened, and that now that ten years have passed she is in her twenties? I remember it being something like "A lot has changed in the last ten years,  some people have gone and some new arrived ...... Sabrina has changed too, she is now a gym leader and has grown from being a teenager and is now in her twenties." Then, How can Erika be 29 and the youngest? 

  Also, a bit of a side note, but,  What about Bugsy? Johto's leaders are  part of the Indigo League too, aren't they?

    Word doubling (recognition -> recognized). Or is that intentional? I might not be interpreting it correctly, this sentence confuses me a bit ^^

  Thanks for the chapter!  


  Very interested to see what will play out with the new pokemon that I assume is a >!porygon!< and rocket casino. I'm also interested in how Blue's new role will end up playing out, and I quite like Erika so far. Also, come on Blue! Contact Red! Do it!

  Aww, the Arcanine family being fed together tugs at the heartstrings...I guess it might be a form of closure for the father? Not sure how much it applies given their level of intelligence, but if they're at least as smart as regular dogs then it probably matters.

- u/throwaway11252016:
  ```
  I liked the exploration of status and Erika's perspective on growing things for mutual benefit. I can't really invest into any of Blue's companions, except maybe Elaine. They're NPCs. It feels less like Blue is leading them and more like he's the cool kid in his group. Overall, I still look forward to Red's arc and the Mewtwo interludes the most.

      There's an anime currently airing called Interspecies Reviewers.  It's a heavily R-rated sex comedy and has next to nothing to do with your fiction but I wanted to make the pun. Blue's team is not reviewing anything close to the same thing. =)

      *Edit* Aaaand I was ninja'd by Memes_Of_Production... 9 days ago. I really need to check my account more often.

  I can't help but feel like him accepting the deal without talking to the group is a mistake. Like for sure the group is arguably "his" but it feels like an over commitment of his uhh authority? i'm not sure what the word would be. But like he has de facto leadership, but i'm not sure that he has or explicitly has the kind of authority over the group to make this kind of long term commitment in the entire group's name. 

  Like he outright states that he doesn't know parts of the group that well and that he is to a certain degree alienated(?) distanced(?) something by the fact that he's the trainer leader of a group of trainers. There's a conversation about not overstepping the bounds of your authority and that moment feels like he may have. 

  Also do we see Erika drink from the bayleef tea? It would be kind of a multi-level reference that she was "causing a status effect" on Blue while negotiating and that i'm not sure if Blue himself was wary enough about it, while it's not as egregious as doing the same for say Koga the poison master it is kind of hard for us to not make the leap of Gym and Gym Leader doing drugs to mildly drugging someone while negotiating.
  ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure it would be a big scandal for a gym leader to drug a visitor and challenger.

    And looking at the wording of their agreement, I don't think it's binding on anyone else. He said that, "Everyone on my group can get in on it," and he certainly viewed that as a great opportunity for them, but if someone said, "No, I'm just going to face the gym like normal," then nothing stops that and Erika would still keep Blue in an advisory role.

            There's a range; remember that Red even asked Blue if it would be okay to have his spinarak attack him early in the story. You can't be charged as a Renegade for something someone agreed to, and yeah the substance itself matters. Slipping someone tea won't meet the requirements, though something with stronger effects might.

  Status eh?  
  Auctoritas, Potestas and Imperius.   
  Can't say those concepts feel very intuitive to me. But I don't deal with status much. This memeplex made sense to me, when I read it thru it all ages ago:  
  [https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/men-and-status-an-introduction/](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/men-and-status-an-introduction/)  
  Forgot almost all about it, though.  
  Potestas maps to ascribed status.  
  Auctoritas possibly maps to achieved status?  
  But I don't see how Imperius maps to Embodied status.  
  Though the ascribed/achieved/emboided trio is explicitly a model for male status, so not something that would work for Erika 🤔

  I think a Champion challenging a Professor would also not work for the same reason, the Champion doesn't have any Imperius in the academic realm.
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The frames are very different: those three forms of status seem to care more about interpersonal status evaluation or comparison. The ones Erika/the Romans cared more about was status as a lever for impact in society.

    >I think a Champion challenging a Professor would also not work for the same reason, the Champion doesn't have any Imperius in the academic realm.

    Right, insofar as "domain expertise" is respected, that comes along with Imperius.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      I've been reading through Ashes of the Past recently (not very rational, but a fun ride), and Giovanni [suggests](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7262793/43/Ashes-of-the-Past) a classification of eight powers, which he names after Pokemon moves, eg "Superpower" is the ability to compel through force, "Hidden Power" refers to influence through company ownership, "Secret Power" is favours owed and goodwill, etc.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        A few of them are a stretch, label wise, but it's a neat frame :)
        ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    >I don't see how Imperius maps to Embodied status.

    :D *Imperius* is a whole different kind of status effect.
    ```

- u/The_Magus_199:
  ```
  Really good chapter! I like the way it seems to be going in this gym; Erika's laying out the ulterior motives in the conversation and then talking Blue around to a mutually beneficial arrangement was super interesting, as is our seeing more of Blue's attempts to avoid being, well, the rival character who stomps you down. I'll gladly look forward to next month!
  ```

- u/NukeNoodles:
  ```
  I really like how much development is going into Blue's relationship to Leaders and Gyms in general. I wonder if it will play into Blue's eventual running of Viridian Gym.
  ```

  - u/Radix2309:
    ```
    Seems likely that will happen after he is champion. It's close to Pallet as well.
