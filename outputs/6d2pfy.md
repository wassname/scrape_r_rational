## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  *(previously on: [decunstructing and explaining card games in order to transform them into viable story settings\)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/69f7nw/d_friday_offtopic_thread/dh6mmoh/?context=3)*

  What if each card is a separate contract of its own with a demon or somesuch that is not tied to a specific demonologist but, rather, to the person who’s currently in possession of the card? 

  Things that can be explained through this:

  * a wide variety of arbitrary rules and restrictions the cards have, including the amount of influence on the real world and the rules by which the cards can be “played” against each other (defined details of the contract);
  * cards of singular and multiple usage (respectively demons who are suspectible to dying after being summoned into our world and demons who will just get their physical forms destroyed when they are “killed” in a card fight); 
  * crafting of new cards (negotiating a new deal with a new demon); 
   * discovering rare and completely unique cards and abilities;
  * impartiality of the gaming system in general;
  * multiple units of the same type being used simultaneously (multiple dimensions, or multiple incarnations of the same demon, or both).

  I've been working on a superhero setting with the usual kitchen sink approach, but I want to put my own spin on mutants rather than copy X-Men wholesale. The main reason to include mutants is so I can be lazy with origin stories and not have to explain how some characters got their powers. I'm not as interested in using them as a metaphor for racial minorities, instead I've been using metahumans in general as a metaphor for immigrants.

  I want to be more creative than say mutants just have a gene that gives them superpowers, though. Every other power source I've included has a bit more detail in how it works and why it exists. I considered saying mutants are conduits for some extradimensional energy source, but I'm kind of already doing that with the Superman-analog and would at least want to use a different dimension that isn't as picky about who gets powers.

  One suggestion I've already heard is that mutants were abducted by aliens at some point in their lives, but I lack an explanation for why aliens would be interested in handing out superpowers to humans seemingly at random. Perhaps some malfunctioning Atlantean technology that was accidentally reactivated and had the job of distributing powers for some reason that benefitted the civilization before it was destroyed.

  Another idea I came up with is to rip off Shadowrun and the webcomic Skin Deep. Mutants are really the descendants of magical creatures who bred with or turned into humans and can change back under certain circumstances. If I go this route I'd call them Changelings and could explain them not being common before the 1900s by requiring them to be relatively well-fed in order to awaken and tap into their race's latent magic.

  Now that I wrote that last one out, it's definitely my favorite. It provides a unique overarching theme, lends itself to a lot of diversity, adds to the worldbuilding of why magic became myth if it was real, explains why focus can be placed on rich countries, still provides the opportunity to hit the same notes that X-Men did about being born the way they were, and could provide some interesting drama between changelings and "real monsters".

  It even ties into another part of the world I was putting a lot of detail in, the Dresden Files-inspired Underground. I originally had governments give magical secret societies jurisdiction over magical affairs just because they saved the world from an apocalyptic threat, but the rising population of changelings would be another great reason to help magical communities expand their control and fund the monster hunting police.

  So it would appear I answered my own question while writing it out. Oops. Well, I'll post it anyway since I like what I've come up with and will never object to more people talking to me about this project of mine. I'm writing the setting for the tabletop RPG Base Raiders since I love the premise of the game but wasn't as big a fan of the worldbuilding and backstory. I am open to more crazy ideas and have all day free to answer questions.

    I like this.

    This is also interesting. 

    Another possible explanation: In the comic *The One*, it's suggested that the Cold War and the associated perpetual threat of a nuclear holocaust had a psychological effect on the people of that time. It draws on some IRL psychological theory, if I recall correctly, but in the comic this is the explanation for some of the weird metaphysical stuff. 

    Anyhow, you could also point to that, or to similar extremes (like the stress of living in massive cities or even the rapid pace of technological change) that have only cropped up relatively recently, to explain why their magic hasn't come to the fore.

      I had considered tying changelings to the specific event, such as a villain performing a magical ritual, but I prefer the idea that it's something that really couldn't be prevented and can't be undone. There's no person or organization to blame, it just wasn't until recently that the human population was large enough and healthy enough for changelings to start appearing in force.

      The Cold War will probably come into play in plenty of other ways, but there's an arms control treaty that prevents nations from creating or conscripting metahumans. After Veit Cong sorcerers inadvertently summoned the devil and governments needed to ask vigilantes and wizards to prevent the apocalypse, everyone agreed things had gotten out of hand.

      There's still plenty of other weirdness in this setting: the Gulf War was fought with large-scale teleporters and mind control towers, a cyborg samurai killed Cthulhu after it was summoned by alien invaders, the center of the Earth is a member of the UN, religious orders have been deputized to police monsters, and there's a country-sized refugee camp for Martians.

      I wouldn't mind including the Atlantean ship for something else, perhaps for my own spin on Marvel's Inhumans, but I can't come up with a rational reason why it would randomly give people powers long after its creators have died. In what way is it malfunctioning and how was it eventually deactivated?

      I conceived of Atlantis as a generic precursor civilization that had spanned the globe, if not further, in prehistoric times, but was destroyed by a godlike entity called Nemesis. Some Atlantean magitech remains buried beneath the Earth's surface and is very dangerous. That's about all I came up with.

      Since the premise of the game is about all major heroes and villains vanishing a year ago, it would work best for the ship to have been stopped before the game begins. There could even be an adventure hook about reactivating the ship to empower more people or destroying it before someone else uses it.

    How about this for a change:

    All humans are actually born with the potential to develop superpowers when they become adults. However, accidents, injuries, traumas, diseases, etc. all cause this potential to disappear, so it was practically impossible for anyone to still have potential by the time they become an adult.

    Until now. 

    With the development of scientific and medical technologies, more and more youths are being raised in extremely safe conditions, no more child labor, no more violence, no more starvation or illness. These people who have lived in such peace are the ones who develop superpowers.

    It would be a nice twist from all the other superpower comics where people get their powers from stress/accidents. Would also greatly shift the plot: e.g., there can't be the standard "kidnapped superchildren in a research lab" story arc, because being kidnapped is a kind of stress that removes the potential for developing superpowers. They can only study adults who have gotten full-blown powers.

    Testing.

    The aliens want to see which (if any) superpowers are safe to apply to themselves, so they find a bunch of barely sapient primitives on some backwater planet that's not on the list of protected intelligent species (thus avoiding all the alien medical ethics committees) and pick out random schmucks to hand out superpowers to so they can see which powers are stable and useful. (One in five of their victims survive the process, on average, though that ratio will get better with time).

    --------------

    Trolling.

    The aliens that hand out powers are the equivalent of a bunch of university students who went off on a holiday and had a bit too much to drink. They hand out a bunch of randomly selected powers to randomly selected planets on a drunken bet. (When the university authorities catch up with them, they will be Not Impressed and might reverse the powers presented to Earth. This could be anytime from 'tomorrow' to 'in seventeen thousand years', depending on exactly how long these aliens consider a suitable time for a holiday.)

    --------------

    Socio-historic research.

    The aliens have long since mastered the handing-out-superpowers technology, but one particular group has recently obtained a research grant to study the long-term effects of superpowers on a primitive society. They picked out their society, carefully handed out superpowers as per experimental protocol, and are now sitting back - well out of sight, and probably cloaked as well - and observing the resultant changes to society. They're taking very good notes, but are unwilling to intervene and mess up their experimental data.

      These are all great. People who got powers this way won't be as common as changelings, but I'm going to try and include these as famous historical anecdotes.

    readers will give you a miracle

    aliens abducting random humans and giving them superpowers for the lulz is totally believable

      and pretty interesting, too. 

      think about what that implies about galactic culture in general: either ET civs are cool with it or they're not (and there could be variation), but this capability is widespread enough that aliens can do it for the lulz

    Maybe it's a kind of entertainment and some aliens earn money on granting people powers and broadcasting the results? They could treat Earth as a location of their reality show.
