  I'm very interested in reading more of Scott's writing (this immediately got added to my RSS reader) but I'm a little iffy on the premise.

    I'll admit that I personally feel Ted Chiang has mined out the [](#s ""literal celestial sphere" idea, between "Tower of Babylon" and "Exhalation,"") but I'd love to be proved wrong.

      I think plenty remains to do -- both of Chiang's stories are about [](#s "the mechanics of a 'literal celestial sphere'") but there's plenty to say about the social effects of finding out that you live in one.

  About damn time.

    ```
    Agreed! Scott's past stuff is up with with Yudkowsky's best, so I'm as hyped for this as I'd be for PBDATB.
