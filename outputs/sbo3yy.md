## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

### Comments:

- u/XIANXIAISSTUPID:
  ```
  I am looking for cultivation novels where the MC is aware of all the common cliches and tropes that comes with them and either uses them to his advantage or actively avoid the pitfalls that comes with them.

  Arrogant young master is probably the best example of this and my all time favorite. He actively can spot Xianxia protagonists in the making and recruits them to his sect. This novel kind of ruined cultivation novels for me because now I drop new stories where they flaunt predictable cliches in front of me. Arrogant young master systematically dismantles them.

  Beware of chicken is also another good example. He knows the cultivation world is hell compared to the modern world he is transmigrated from so he just leaves his sect to start a farm. It kind of devolves into your classic Xianxia which is okay but it got boring for me. The author is giving POV chapters to useless side characters we never see again.

  A senior brother is too steady shows how cautious one can be for giving face. Knowing the tropes, He constantly makes sure not to offend anyone even though he is several level higher than anyone. He also hides his cultivation and trains in seclusion due to the paranoia surrounding the heavens. The caveat to this is I do not recommend this novel at all even though it’s exactly what I am looking for. The translations degrades in quality and soon it’s like reading a novel your 6th grade little brother wrote up for his homework.

  Top tier providence is another example similar to arrogant young master being transmigrated into another body with a system. Because of his system he is extremely handsome and everyone wants to acquaint themselves to him but he simply wants to become immortal first and secluded himself. This is an example where bad translations ruin the novel for you. We have some scenes that simply do not make sense since the translation quality is so bad. One minute he found a treasure of 10000 superior stones that can last generations the next he spends it all on a simple potion. Either the auhor or the translator made a huge mistake but I cannot recommend this series to anyone since it’s like this.

    [When Immortal Ascension Fails...](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36597/when-immortal-ascension-fails-time-travel-to-try): Isekai + reincarnator story - the MC was isekaied into a shitty xianxia, nearly ascended to godhood, but then had to revert back due to a failed ascension. Lots of tropes, which she's both aware of and has future knowledge of.

    [This Young Master is not Cannon Fodder](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/33461/this-young-master-is-not-cannon-fodder): clearly started out as an AYM clone, but is still updating frequently (instead of the once-every-18-month drop of AYM)

    [Speedrunning the Multiverse](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46319/speedrunning-the-multiverse): the MC is an omnipotent deity who, well, speedruns to omnipotence for fun. As such he also knows all the tropes, and tries to blend in with them so people don't get _too_ suspicious of his meteoric rise.
    ```

    - u/PSA-Daykeras:
      ```
      > Speedrunning the Multiverse

      Meh. It's just a normal reincarnated with knowledge story, except it has a timer at the bottom of every chapter. It doesn't really play around with the tropes properly, and it's pretty boring honestly.
      ```

  - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
    ```
    > The author is giving POV chapters to ... side characters we never see again.

    I feel that a big part of the story's appeal is seeing how people react to Jin and his associates, so for me this is actually a positive, not a negative. 

    Not a criticism, to each their own, I just want to offer a differing viewpoint to avoid potential readers missing out on a (imho) great story.
    ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    AFAIK History's Strongest Senior Brother is the origin of some of the ways of playing with tropes that get re-used in AYM. It's... well, it's alright.
    ```

  - u/CringingInTheNight:
    ```
    Forty Millenniums of Cultivation.

    It is completely aware of all the tropes, and plays some straight while subverting or reconstructing others. The characters are genre savvy.
    ```

  - u/GrizzlyTrees:
    ```
    It doesn't exactly fit your request, but just in case you never heard about it, Cradle (by Will Wight) is a pretty good cultivation book series, with less emphasis on classic cultivation tropes and clichés.

    The books are pretty well written, with an overarching plot slowly revealed, I'm currently starting book 4 out of existing 10 (it's not complete), and each book ends pretty satisfyingly. It starts following a classic Wuxia underdog protagonist, but the story has some interesting twists that take it beyond the by-the-numbers cultivation story beats. I will add that if you dislike the initial plot of the first book (as I did), it's probably worth it to carry on, as the story changes considerably.
    ```

  Here are a bunch of recommendations/ anti-recommendations from what I've been reading this past month. I figure since I always enjoy these posts, here's one from my end.

  Published Books:  
  [New Game Minus](https://www.amazon.com/New-Game-Minus-Complete-Fantasy-ebook/dp/B085LMS2MS) is a LitRPG trilogy by Sarah Lin, author of Street Cultivation. 

  The protagonist is a Lich who swaps souls with an adventurer right before he dies. Upon reincarnating as this adventurer, he discovers his world is a game for aliens from another dimension.   
  Honestly, this whole series was one of the more rational things I've read in the past year. Bloodwraith is a competent character who figures out how to abuse the system early on, and even with all of the abuse, he still has to figure out ways to fight his enemies, because they're just as smart as he is.

   I'd definitely recommend this if you want a LitRPG.

  [Soulhome (The Weirkey Chronicles Book 1)](https://www.amazon.com/Soulhome-Weirkey-Chronicles-Book-1-ebook/dp/B08P7TYG41) is also by Sarah Lin.

  It's a fantasy romp through "The Nine Worlds" and features a unique magic system about building houses in your soul.

  Honestly, I hated it. Theo the protagonist is rational, but he's so unlikeable, and he fails to think and reflect on himself, which causes him problems. Everything seems to work out for him, and it feels like Theo could be so much more, but he barely talks to any of his "friends" and is only focused on getting stronger, which he fails to do. He's barely able to fight people of his own strength, and doesn't make up for it with well thought out plans, or anything.

  Maybe I'm too harsh on it, but I've read the first two books and I was not impressed. No recommendation from me.

  Web Serials:

  [Wizard Space Program](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/43753/wizard-space-program) by GMSteward

  I haven't seen much talk about this one on here, but it's right up r/rational's alley. Its about a wizard who wants to go to space, and uses magic to start a space program. The author talks about real-world physics and parallels to our world, and it was a really enjoyable read.

  Definitely a recommendation.

  [Jackal Among Snakes](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/48969/jackal-among-snakes-gamelit-fantasy-progression) by Nemorosus

  Our protagonist gets isekaied to an open-world RPG where he is a top contributor to its Wiki. It reminds me of Isekai Speedrun, and other similar works where the hero knows about all of the intricacies of the world, and sets out to solve problems, mostly so he doesn't die.

  Definitely a recommendation.

  [Summoned! To an RPG world](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/39191/summoned-to-an-rpg-world-litrpg) by Oisin Muldowney

  Our hero Sean De Courcy is isekaied into the body of King Carlos, who's running his realm into ruin. Sean is really good at an MMORPG, and figures out the depths of the system. It's a somewhat rational take on a classic formula, where the LitRPG is focused on kingdoms rather than individuals. 

  Definitely a recommendation.

  I have a bunch of other stories I've read, which I might post about in the future, but I figure five stories is more than enough for now.
  ```

    ```
    > New Game Minus is a LitRPG trilogy by Sarah Lin ...

    I read the opening chapter of that, it is rather amusing how Bloodwraith is cursing at the System. "I do not need your false encouragement, infernal box!"
    ```

    - u/ansible:
      ```
      Also, when asking about EXP, Bloodwraith says:

      > "What? I collect a hundred of these arbitrary points, only to be granted five *different* arbitrary points? What is the purpose of any of this madness?"
      >
      > The boxes had no answer to that.

      And later at a level up:

      > Just as Bloodwraith was about to curse at the box, his jaw opened in surprise as *music* began to play. It was a jaunty little tune that made hiim search about for some sort of traveling bard, yet he realized that it was coming from the boxes. Specifically, from a new box that appeared before him. Unlike the soft blue of the others, this one shimmered as if it thought itself more important.
      >
      > He hated it more than all the others.

      Shortly afterwards, he discovers grinding for levels...
      ```

  - u/FireCire7:
    ```
    SummonEd To and RPG World isn’t bad, with most characters seeming to act rationally, deceptions are nonobvious, and allies act with their own consistent goals. I found the second half a bit repetitive with >!the same basic framework of “oh a new enemy”, they attack or try to offer a deal and then backstab. Luckily, our MC’s super lance (which was hard to get), high levels, high wisdom, and unorthodox consistent relationship with the necromancer save him and let him save the day. On their deathbed, the enemies say, “The necromancer will betray you.” Gurgle. Die.  The bits that make our guy special are mostly motivated, but there’s not too much suspense, just interest in which of his 5 trump cards can help him save the day, and curiosity on how their going to resolve the game and take down the gods. !<
    ```

- u/ansible:
  ```
  I don't remember exactly how, but I ended up reading [The Calamity of a Reborn Witch](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32908/the-calamity-of-a-reborn-witch). It isn't rational per-se, but the MC is at least fairly clever. It is a isekai + timeloop, with some curious worldbuilding. Spoilers for the first 1.5 books follow.

  ----------------

  First curious author choice (no spoiler tag because this is revealed very early in book 1): The first book starts with the MC after she's been in the fantasy world for ~6 years. She has already leveraged her knowledge of the future of the fantasy world *and* her knowledge of a modern industrialized society (definitely not Earth though) to create vast wealth and important political connections. It is so typical that we join an isekai protagonist at the beginning of their journey in the fantasy world. I guess the author decided to just skip all that. It remains unexplained just how the MC managed to secure one of her most important political connections (Constance) though.

  Second curious author choice: >!Towards the end of book 1, it is revealed that the MC (Carina) not just has access to the original person's (Maura's) memory, but her *ghost* is hanging around and able to talk to Carina. While the MC doesn't rely on the ghost for much of anything, and the ghost is only occasionally available, I was surprised that the topic didn't come up earlier in the book. It is also not clear that ghosts in general are a common thing in this fantasy world. More hints that something funny is afoot (perhaps even another looper) has been dropped at the end of book 2.!<

  Third curious thing: >!The initial impression in book 1 is that witch-ability is relatively rare in Lafeara, where it is super-illegal and witches are commonly burned at the stake. This is spearheaded by The Church, who employs witch-hunters. The witch hunters can seemingly "sniff out" witches, though there are (rare?) artifacts that can "mask the scent" of witch-ability, but this doesn't seem like a stable situation. Especially in light of the hereditary nature of witch-ability. Further curiousness is that Lafeara is part of an empire that is explicitly pro-witch (the Emperor is a witch as is most of the nobility and army), and yet Lafeara is also beholden to The Church which is vehemently anti-witch. It just doesn't seem like a stable situation to me, though perhaps that is the point of the book series.!<
  ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    Fourth curious thing: There seems to be a wide range of magical ability, from half-witches that (usually?) have not much ability, to full witches, to the top-end witches (pure-blood) who also have more direct ties to one of the various gods / goddesses. What's also not clear is how the nation of Lafeara can hold its own with other pro-witch nations it borders on, while being nominally anti-witch.  The Church has the witch hunters, who are allowed to wield magic, and can counter the powers of witches, at least on an individual level. Lafeara doesn't have either witches or witch hunters. >!So it isn't clear why Ventrayna (the pro-witch empire) didn't completely subjugate Lafeara, and how / why it permits The Church to operate inside its vassal state.  Seems like a very unstable situation, which as mentioned previously, may be the point.!<

    Also something that should be in a category tag: Clamity is a "chick flick": its style and plot heavily features big strong men saving the heroin from trouble (but its also apparent she could have handled it herself) and a lot of social revenge and intrigue.

    Its probably a taste thing, like the harem tag, but apparently it's not for me.

  Hey good people. I’m looking for some good Worm fics. Specifically ones that aren’t too short, have decent pacing, and write the characters accurately (I have definitely noticed some fics are well written, but the way the characters speak/behave isn’t really faithful to the source). 

  I haven’t ready many worm fics, so don’t hesitate to rec whatever you’ve enjoyed. Some of the stories I’ve read that I’ve liked have been Compulsion (Worm/Prototype), the string of one shots somewhere with Taylor having various S9 powers, and the Worm section of Companion Chronicles. Thanks!
  ```

  - u/ulyssessword:
    ```
    [Cenotaph](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1152749/chapters/2337442) is one of the best.  It's well-written and consistent, with all of the butterflies coming (mostly) naturally from each other.  The major point of divergence is quite early, in Chapter 3 when >!Bakuda finds out Taylor's identity, and bombs her house, killing Danny.!<  One thing that I noted about the story is that the characters only act on the information they have.  There's a situation early in the sequel where one of the characters has no reason to know something that the reader knows, so they made utterly ignorant statements and simply moved on with their day.
    ```

    - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:

      And if it feels a bit fanon-y these days, that's because it *created* much of the early fanon like "Fortress Construction".

    I like these three by Discreet. Start with [28 Taylors later](https://archiveofourown.org/works/7678162/chapters/17488978)   its a pretty short story, then if you liked it try long [it starts with one](https://archiveofourown.org/works/16970325/chapters/39885288) or mid-length [a word](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10969299/chapters/24421644).

    Just A Phase is one of the best ones I've read, highly recommended. Taylor gets shipped off to the Wards, is extremely unhappy about things, indulges in malicious compliance with the rules.

    Hope Comes to Brockton Bay is extremely fluffy and fun. Wildly overpowered OC isekais into Brockton Bay, proceeds to fix things.

    Weaver Nine is a pretty amazing story which involves Taylor having been in Jack Slash's shoes and Jack in hers.

  Anyone know what’s up with the Last Orellen? Just started...and finished it, well, just now. Saw the hiatus tag but heard people say he’s taking a short break and building up a backlog until about right now.

  However, apparently people are also saying he’s had complete radio silence since the 24th of December, not even logging on. What are the chances this novel is dropped? Hope the author’s not dead. I tend to avoid novels that have a high chance of abandonment, but I’ve still been burned on Super Minion and now maybe this. It’s especially annoying when nothing is said, like for Super Minion where it just stopped with no announcements, while the author still logs onto RoyalRoad very often. Hope this one is still going, since it’s definitely one of the more interesting novels on RR.

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    Yes, it's pretty good. I'm kind of over expecting new authors to deliver, but I agree it's disappointing when something you really like gets dropped. I had made a note to check on this one in a year, because I was getting overambitious vibes from the author, and the quality was high, which usually means authors have a hard time keeping up.
    ```

    - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
      ```
      My years of experience with webfiction over the past several years made me immediately suspicious that the entire project was dead when I noticed the lack of update. The disparity between what actually exists so far and what this story has the potential to become, given its current quality and its foreshadowing of future plot, is very significant. What's worse, a lot of the recs I've seen around this sub have been conflating the two, which made me quite surprised when I caught up and realized that the story was still in the opening stages.
      ```

      - u/TheTruthVeritas:
        ```
        Definitely. It was hyped up a lot for me like it was going to be one of the new greats of RR, a fresh, unique, and competent take on what it does, as an expansive epic fantasy story. I was expecting something on the level and scope of PGtE, but before I knew it I finished it all and it barely just started! I was majorly surprised by that.

    The author has a reddit account, they've been MIA for about a month as well, but one of their last posts said they wanted to build up a backlog of chapters so they can start a patreon in January.

    >I'm probably going to do a Patreon in January. Lots of people have suggested striking while the iron is hot, but I really want to keep my headspace right for the story at the moment. I wasn't expecting it to take off all of a sudden, and I'm worried monetizing might take it from a passion project toward something that feels really high-pressure before I've gotten my bearings.

    >I'm going to focus on building up a good backlog of chapters in December to give the project a cushion and have something to offer Patrons.

    https://www.reddit.com/user/Sieley/

    That said disappearing without any sort of notice is kinda suspicious, usually authors will let their followers know when they're taking a break. Their last post was about some health complications too. Hopefully they're doing ok.

      While this is true, it's generally stated that *profitability* is more of a two year thing. The longer it spends on KU, the more people in that pool have read it, and the less money it makes over time. So after two years, the money is starting to run dry, and it makes sense to send it somewhere else where it can continue to generate profit, or simply be read by people without any profit but with e.g. being able to gain more readers or have "exposure".

  Anime recommendations in the genre of "everything happens as expected" with atrocious graphics:

  [Sakurada Reset](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34102/Sakurada_Reset) Supposedly creative use of special powers, mild existential drama, romance. Gets better after 2 episodes.

  [Back Arrow](https://myanimelist.net/anime/40964/Back_Arrow) Scientist in main cast, consistent characters, lots of plot, Taniguchi Gorou.

  [Godzilla: S.P](https://myanimelist.net/anime/43229/Godzilla__SP) Someone decided to leave the whole script to a fan of mathy metaphors. The same one that wrote that episode from Space Dandy.

  [Seikaisuru Kado](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32032/Seikaisuru_Kado) The brave investigation of things you shouldn't do in real world. Character from another author's work was spotted with a copy of Permutation City. Also no one likes the ending.

  [Kubikiri Cycle: Aoiro Savant to Zaregototsukai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33263/Kubikiri_Cycle__Aoiro_Savant_to_Zaregototsukai) Best dialogs from NisiOisiN, best music from Kajiura Yuki, but not quite fair play? Anyway the joke about global warming is worth it.

  Also World Trigger 3rd season recently concluded and compared to the first one they added minimum amount of quality animation in 2nd and 3rd. Not much progress in plot though.

    The Menocht Loop, but takes until book 4 for this mechanic to appear (it’s a 5 book series). The mechanic is that everyone regenerates after death in the location they were 10 minutes prior, which is highly abusable. Consequently, one of the worst fates is being stranded in outer space/the void for more than 10 minutes, preventing a means of return via death. Then if you have no magic defenses against a vacuum, you’ll enter into a perpetual death loop of respawning and dying ad infinitum until you hopefully have a breakthrough or a friend rescues you.

  Does anyone know any good Dungeon building or monster MC novels? And by dungeon building, I mean the good ones, where they actually build a dungeon and put effort into it to kill things in clever ways, not a crappy reskinned kingdom building that’s pacifistic and treats all this as a unique amazing concept that’s optimal and never been done before. I absolutely hate those types, which have been essentially all the ones I read. Something like Dungeon Core Chat Room, but with more killing and exploring and growing, or The Divine Dungeon, but not nearly as shit.

  And as for monster MC novels, I’m similarly in dire straits. The only one I can say is actually pretty damn good would be So I’m a Spider, So What? Everything else I’ve read has been abysmal, like Chrysalis with its very phoned in litrpg progression and every character being a complete idiot, or like ELLC where the monster parts are actually pretty good...but then there’s the vore sex and horrible ending. ARMOR was pretty good. Artificial Jelly was a disappointment, Shade Touched is still on hiatus. Snake Report might be even worse than Chrysalis.

  I’m so desperate for good novels in either of these two categories.

  - u/Amonwilde:
    ```
    I'm kind of with you on the dungeon core novels. They're mostly all bad anyway, but if you're going to engage with the concept, better the core be filling the place with swinging blades or whatever and not making friends with the local orphans.

    I can't think of web fiction to suit you, but one of my favorite pieces of literary fiction is Gardner's [Grendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel_(novel)). The main character is, you know, Grendel, so he eats people and stuff. It was written in the 70s and is existentialist, so Grendel is kind of questioning everything all the time.

    > The dragon tipped up his great tusked head, stretched his neck, sighed fire. “Ah, Grendel!” he said. He seemed that instant almost to rise to pity. “You improve them, my boy! Can’t you see that yourself? You stimulate them! You make them think and scheme. You drive them to poetry, science, religion, all that makes them what they are for as long as they last. You are, so to speak, the brute existent by which they learn to define themselves. The exile, captivity, death they shrink from—the blunt facts of their mortality, their abandonment—that’s what you make them recognize, embrace! You are mankind, or man’s condition: inseparable as the mountain-climber and the mountain. If you withdraw, you’ll instantly be replaced. Brute existents, you know, are a dime a dozen. No sentimental trash, then. If man’s the irrelevance that interests you, stick with him! Scare him to glory! It’s all the same in the end, matter and motion, simple or complex. No difference, finally. Death, transfiguration. Ashes to ashes and slime to slime, amen.”
    > 
    > I was sure he was lying. Or anyway half-sure. Flattering me into tormenting them because he, in his sullen hole, loved viciousness. I said, “Let them find some other ‘brute existent,’ whatever that is. I refuse.”
    > 
    > “Do!” he said leering scornfully. “Do something else, by all means! Alter the future! Make the world a better place in which to live! Help the poor! Feed the hungry. Be kind to idiots! What a challenge!”
    > 
    > He no longer looked at me, no longer made any pretense of telling the truth. “Personally,” he said, “my great ambition is to count all this”—he waved vaguely at the treasure around him—“and possibly sort it into piles. ‘Know thyself,’ that’s my dictum. Know how much you’ve got, and beware of strangers!”

      > if you're going to engage with the concept, better the core be filling the place with swinging blades or whatever and not making friends with the local orphans

      I agree to a certain extent, but I've long believed that if a dungeon's goal is to maximize the number of humans dying within their demesne, which is almost always the case, then the ideal solution is to build a city instead of a pitfall.  Just as an example, the average yearly deaths in Oregon over the past five years is approximately thirty-five thousand people. Oregon has approximately four million people, which is coincidentally the higher end of what we estimate the population of ancient Rome was (the city itself, not the empire as a whole). It's therefore plausible that a non-modern city could become so populous, and I have no doubts that the mortality rate of a pseudo-medieval fantasy world is substantially higher than modern-day Oregon. I just can't see how a classical dungeon could compete with a city when it comes to maximizing the number of nearby deaths.

        Well, if a goal is to maximize the number of *deaths*, and just the number, without any constraints whatsoever, then yeah. This is similar to how it's a trope that if a genre-savvy Dark Lord wants to rule unopposed, he should make sure that he rules with justice amd mercy. But if there are some additional quantities that death count serves as a proxy for, or if there are additional constraints, then city may prove suboptimal.

        Off the top of my head. Maybe the quality of death matters in a comparable manner to the quantity of death - being eaten by a Manticore can give more points than having your dungeonaut choke on a pretzel. Maybe the quality of the dungeonaut (i.e. by taking into consideration the QALY's lost) also matters - killing a young amd vital 20 something nets you more points by killing someone one foot in the grave. If the constraint is the number of currently alive people living  comfortably in it, you cant just build a modern city.

        A lot of the problems come when you have a modern (and by that I mean contemporary-values-having) protagonist (whether isekaied or just here) or a person discussing the story take a look at the world's premise and conclude that Y could be done more efficiently via B instead of A, therefore the world is poorly planned. But the protagonist (or a would-be online critic) uses Y in a different sense than denizens of the world, or do not understand (by not having the world-specific metis) that Y is just a proxy for X, and X can reached via A instead of B.

        Sure. But that's a city, not a dungeon. As easily say the dungeon should just encompass the world and the world become a dungeon. At some point you've popped the semantic bubble around the word dungeon and the genre and title become unconnected to the material.

        A dungeon in the sense of a dungeon core (really based on Dungeon Keeper) is a labyrinth filled with tricks and traps, and maybe a (figurative) Minotaur or two. There is (presumably, since I've yet to read a good one) some appeal in being the Daedalus at the heart of that labyrinth. If your story is about building a city, or a civilization, or the revolutionary group that will overthrow the local monarch, likely better to start with a more appropriate premise.

        I guess I give a pass to Blue Core because it's a *cough* different kind of dungeon.

          I understand your point, but the problem is largely because there is no good reason to go full murderhobo; even when authors try to explicitly write a story where the dungeon is maximally incentivized to go full murderhobo, analyzing the situation almost always finds that the optimal strategy is cooperation to a greater or lesser extent. 

          Pretty much the number one request on any genre here is "X genre, but played smart instead of straight." Even in this very thread, someone's requesting xianxia like that. What you're requesting is essentially an incredibly tropey story which uncritically implements every cliché associated with the concept. Which isn't bad necessarily, I've read pretty much every dungeon core novel out there so it's not like I can judge, but it can also be deeply unsatisfying when the entire premise is only held up by the protagonist and/or villains being *incredibly* stupid.

          >A dungeon in the sense of a dungeon core (really based on Dungeon Keeper) is a labyrinth filled with tricks and traps, and maybe a (figurative) Minotaur or two

          ...Have you played Dungeon Keeper? You're largely using your Dungeon as a staging ground to take the fight to someone else, not building a labyrinth filled with tricks and traps. A Dungeon in the sense you've described is largely based around what you'd see in a game of D&D.
          ```

          - u/Amonwilde:
            ```
            I've played Dungeon Keeper. You build a dungeon with traps and monsters. If you're playing against another core, then you eventually take the battle to them, but mostly by growing your way over there. Many or most missions are defensive, or you have to intercept heroes going from point A to point B, or you have to grow the dungeon to encompass a certain number of portals. It's primarily a defensive game, in that you're playing a dungeon and not an army. In DK2, which is the one I played because I'm old, there are like 10 spells, and you can only cast like 2 outside your realm, and only one of those is useful for offense (the rally one). You also can build like 10 different traps.

            I understand the premise of the sub, and I appreciate a deconstruction, though honestly they can pall fairly quickly. It's good to be trope-aware, which can let you make things fresh and keep things from getting repetitive. Ultimately, though, I don't think rationality in stories is primarily or chiefly about avoiding tropes. Stories are made of tropes. It's about executing tropes coherently and intelligently.

            It feels like you're arguing a strawman with regard to the part about requesting tropy stories. I didn't make any requests, just agreed with OP and recommended Grendel. But setting that aside, wanting a story that fits the premise isn't wanting a story that hits all the tropes in a premise, or uncritically implements all or a subset of those tropes. If someone asks for an isekai novel, and you recommend The Phoenix Project because it's a rational fish-out-of-water story, it's a less useful recommendation . And, yes, isekai is inherently a pretty irrational premise, broadly speaking, but it's more what will be done in the execution of that unlikely premise that will make the story rational or not, or also good or not.

    [Bunkercore](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/17051/bunkercore) is what you're looking for. It's by the author of Threadbare, which I also found delightful.

    As for monster MCs... [Goblins](https://www.goblinscomic.org/comic/06252005/) is probably the best example of the genre. 

    Also, have you tried [Vigor Mortis](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40373/vigor-mortis)? Vita isn't a "monster" in the sense of "killed on sight by adventurers," but she definitely lands somewhere between "dangerous to be around" and "existential threat to reality." It's great fun.
    ```

    - u/TheTruthVeritas:
      ```
      Yeah I’m up to date on Vigor Mortis. When I mean monster MCs, I don’t like to include things like vampires/demons(the human looking ones)/skellies or similar such creature, as they tend to read more like a super powered/magical MC sorta story, instead of getting deep into the good juicy monster stuff. Like Salvos which I found to be extremely mediocre and doesn’t feel at all like a monster MC and is essentially just a mage/rogue MC. These sort of characters tend to act too human, instead of the alien mindset and situation which I love to see. I really like some of these ones though, like Journey of Black and Red, but they don’t scratch that primal monster itch I’ve been looking for.

      But that’s just a personal oddity of mine. Vita is sufficiently monstrous and wild, which I really like, and Vigor Mortis is pretty good. There’s just some things that annoy me about it. I absolutely hate it when Vita suddenly goes out of character and does a stupid mistake that’s all on her, and then get all edgy and blames humanity or other things. Like the Angelien thing, and the parasite slimes arc conflict. 

      I very much enjoy the latest chapters though, as that’s the sort of stuff I expected from Vigor Mortis initially. Vita debating with Jelisa on Templar ideology and the Penelope war chapter were really good.

    Stephenson novels like *Anathem* or *Cryptonomicon.* The latter is a combination of WWII codebreaking, buried treasure, and 90s telecom infrastructure, all combined via a love of mathematics and cryptography. The former is more about knowledge monks, language drift, astronomy, and...uh...other stuff.

  I'm looking for good recommendations that are not self inserts, isekais,  litrpg nor fanfiction. Not that I don't like those, but I feel that lately this is most of what I end up reading, so would like to vary a bit.

  Books by established writers also welcome. I'm always interested in books by established writers that the community feels are rational. Right now, I'm very much in the mood for a space opera so would be partial to that :)

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan saga (start with "Shards of Honour" and read in internal chronological order from there) is among my favourite series and is very good space opera. If you've not read that, it has my strongest recommendation.

    If you are in the mood for something \*ridiculously\* over the top, I am a huge fan of Simon Green's "Deathstalker" series. It pulls out all the stops, it chews the scenery, it is ridiculous and gloriously nonsensical, and the author seemingly has never met a space opera trope he's not into. It's terrible and I love it, and you will know within about 10 pages if you're going to hate it.

    Tim Pratt's Axiom series (Starts with The Wrong Stars) is a very good classic-style ragtag crew against godlike aliens space opera.

    C.S. Friedman's "The Madness Season" is a space opera ish sci-fi about a vampire fighting against an alien hivemind.

    Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Children of Time" and "Children of Ruin" aren't really space opera, but they are mostly set in space and are very good, if you're into stories about uplifted animals with very nonhuman intelligences. Tchaikovsky has an ongoing thing where he's much better at writing nonhumans than he is at humans, and it shows here, but they're really interesting books.

      >Lois McMaster Bujold's Vorkosigan saga (start with "Shards of Honour" and read in internal chronological order from there)

      There are a few different recommended reading orders for this series depending on personal preference. I generally recommend starting with *[Warrior's Apprentice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61906.The_Warrior_s_Apprentice)* because that's the first book from the main protagonist's perspective (Miles Vorkosigan), and it's a good introduction to the break-neck pacing and personal themes that are at the heart of the series.

      *[Shards of Honour](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61903.Shards_of_Honour)* and its chronological sequel *[Barrayar](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61905.Barrayar)* are written from the perspective of Miles's mother, Cordelia, and they are a bit slower paced, because Cordelia tends to live in the background of the action rather than in the thick of it the way Miles does.

      That said, they are all excellent books, so there's no 'wrong' way to start.

      Aside from those, I recommend one of Bujold's other novels, *[The Curse of Chalion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61886.The_Curse_of_Chalion)*. It is fantasy rather than scifi, but it has a similar focus on interpersonal relationships, the meaning of honor and loyalty, and plenty of intrigue and action along the way.

      I also second the recommendation for *[The Madness Season](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36161.The_Madness_Season)*: it contains some of the best takes on truly alien psychology that I've ever read, and the 'vampire in a scifi setting' idea is done well, not as hokey as it might sound.

        >That said, they are all excellent books, so there's no 'wrong' way to start.

        There is in fact exactly one wrong way to start, which is to go full internal chronological order and start with "Falling Free", which is weirdly boring and irrelevant to the rest of the series.

        But yeah depending on one's preferences I think there are at least three reasonable starting points. Shards of Honour, Warrior's Apprentice, and Komarr are all good points to start depending on what someone is looking for. I think Shards of Honour is very good though, and as the chronologically first it's a decent default.

          I haven't gotten around to reading that one yet. I thought that the backstory of the "quaddie" society seen in *Diplomatic Immunity* would be interesting.

          - u/DRMacIver:
            ```
            I guess I don't actively recommend \*against\* it, as I'm a Bujold completionist, but it's a bad place to start. It was the first one I read and it took ages before I tried another. The tone is very different and there's not a huge amount going on. It might be better if one has read Diplomatic Immunity and generally has more context for the world.

          (sorry to resurrect this old thread)

          A few months ago, I started with the Warrior's Apprentice on recommendation from some thread here and I loved it. I then went on to The Vor Game because it seemed next in the internal chronology (though looking at some lists on the internet now maybe that's not actually true), but so far it feels very slow to me and I have trouble continuing it. Did I make some kind of mistake in picking this book next or do I just have to get on with it (I'm currently at 15% of the book)?
          ```

          - u/DRMacIver:
            ```
            I'd forgotten this, but the Vor Game has a bit of a slow start. Are you still in the bit on Kyril Island? If so, you might want to soldier on through that bit and give it a few chapters after that point, at which point it becomes more like Warrior's Apprentice. If that's still boring you, I think you could probably get away with skipping the book - most of the books are reasonably self-contained as plots even if you lose some of the backstory.

            (For context, The Vor Game is actually two stories - the initial sequence on Kyril island was published as a standalone short story called The Weatherman, and The Vor Game's main story picks up immediately where that leaves off despite being about something completely different, so they were bundled together as one book)
