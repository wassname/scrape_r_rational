  Ah, this story. Does it ever get any better? I read up to where a bunch of people get on the abandoned ship, and by that point I was bored out of my mind. You wouldn’t think you *could* be that bored when the story is about a giant intelligent spaceship waging war across space and time, but it somehow manages to be an incredible slog to get through.

  A much better, more enjoyable story is Chrysalis: [[Reddit Link]](https://old.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/55v9e1/chrysalis/) [[EPUB File]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0MRQBkXgY3_OTlEWFJGUkM1MDg/view)

    It's hard to recommend or not recommend when your criticism lacks, well, criticism. "I was bored" is your reaction, and it's kinda like saying "Thor did it" in terms of predictive power.

    Ah, I recognize Chrysalis. Failed to grab me. Did a lot of telling, not so much showing, and the narrative voice lacks... Presence? It tells me about what happened to it, not what it *is* happening; gives me a somewhat descriptive blow-by-blow but doesn't really convey the experience the entity is having. It tells me *that* I should care, but kinda fails to actually deliver on pulling those heart strings.

    Red One's hatred is palpable, and although it's not as pronounced as in other works, I do feel like each character's sections have a distinct feel to them.

    The story has progressed substantially from where you got to; that abandoned ship *is* the main character, so if that's as far as you got you didn't really get past the intro. That said, I don't really feel like the story has changed much in feel, although there's a lot less crawling through corridors and a lot more ship-to-ship combat. Check out some of the Red Hand side stories if you want a better idea as to how it reads later on.

      Okay, well, here is some more detailed criticism then. The ship AI is handed an idiot ball the size of the moon, since it never branched out or even harvested resources from planets after many hundreds of years, the pacing is all out of whack, it’s way too slow and adds a huge amount of pointless detail toward every aspect of the story, the fact that there even needs to be any crawling through corridors says volumes about how nonsensical the worldbuilding is, and what I’ve seen of the problems faced tells me the solution is often brute force instead of anything clever. Whereas your experience with Chrysalis seems more to do with the writing style, The Last Angel’s problems stem from the fact that the writer had no idea what they were doing and made a subpar story—seriously, compare the amount of telling between the two stories, The Last Angel is practically *drowning* in it and most of it’s not even needed for the plot.

        I can't speak to a lot of your criticism, but it's revealed that basically the entire galaxy (both the Compact *and* the Compact's enemies) really fucking fear and hate AIs, so it's not like it can find a friendly star nation and ally with them. Additionally, it does try to branch out, but it's pretty much always on the backfoot. It's a single ship fighting against a star nation that spans hundreds of solar systems -- its logistically outclassed by several orders of magnitude, and while using AI builders helps some, it still needs a manufacturing chain that it just doesn't have. Also, it has to spend decades or even centuries recovering from battles with the Compact; that's what it was doing before the Compact discovered it at the start of the story.

          Space is big. Finding an uninhabited planet isn't that big of a stretch. The thing is, I've seen no mention of restrictions on the ship A.I. Why doesn't it copy itself onto a bunch of future disks and place them everywhere? It just doesn't look like it's trying to actually fulfill its utility function. You could refute my individual points quite easily, just ... look at the big picture. It's kind of odd, isn't it? Confusing, maybe?

        Fantastic!

        >  since it never branched out or even harvested resources

        It did, actually, that's literally what the current plot is about. Also the insurgency (the Red Hand) it shadow-funded over the last ~50 years. All of this starts to show up as you get past what's basically the intro, while they're repairing Red without knowing what she it.

        > the pacing is all out of whack, it’s way too slow

        Chalk it up to style differences. I liked it. I generally found that everything went somewhere, although it could take awhile.

        > huge amount of pointless detail toward every aspect of the story

        That is definitely one of the things I like about it that I don't like about Chrysalis; I find that those details flesh out a world and a story; I find them critical to "showing" in "show don't tell".

        >  any crawling through corridors says volumes about how nonsensical the worldbuilding is

        Ehhhh I don't think this is legit. The part you were reading through is a damaged Red pretending to be a hulk to trick some meat into doing repairs for her. It goes a lot of places from there, and generally, there's ended up being a reason behind every aspect of that world that had me wondering.

        >  often brute force instead of anything clever

        Wow, no. Once you get to to the ship fights and strategic ploys it's a lot of clever.

        >  seems more to do with the writing style

        Absolutely. I don't enjoy reading the writing style that Chrysalis starts out with; normally I'd just skip to later chapters but I haven't seen how to do that on Reddit.

        > compare the amount of telling between the two stories

        In writing, what do you see as telling and what do you see as showing? I get the sense we might have a big difference of opinion here.

          Remember, I haven’t read to the current plot. I did read that it had been drifting around for hundreds of years at a time, and never once harvested resources while that was going on, which is what I was referring to.

          And sure, details are well and good, but the way they’re introduced here don’t actually progress the story most of the time. The text is clearly aware that the readers don’t have the details of the situation of the universe, and painstakingly tells us, directly, everything that’s even tangentially relevant, even hammering these points home over and over again. Humans are low on the totem pole around these parts, it says, and then says again, and again, and again, each time more explicitly.

          And sure, it might get clever later. Again, I read only a fraction of the story. The problem is what the narrative has shown is the norm. If strategic ploys suddenly happen where before it was brute force against force, worldbuilding crumbles, because the question has to be asked: why now? Why never before?

          Telling is directly providing exposition to the reader within narrative or dialogue. Showing is generally description, action, or dialogue that may have exposition in it, but always serves to advance the plot.
          ```

          - u/narfanator:
            ```
            Sure. I think part of what's going on is that it was originally written as a form of creepy pasta - just the horror show that is "wait, this ship is alive is wants to kill us", and then grows from there.

            The cleverness shows up in ship battles a bit, but more so the strategic maneuvering, which is usually Red doing feints-in-feints... although yeah, at the end there's always a brute force punch. It's not so much that it's clever about how it fights, but about which fights it fights.

            So, the simplest answer to "why now, why never before?" is "scale", battles with bodies to battles with ships to battles with fleets, etc.

            Re: show/tell, I'd agree except for the need to advance the plot. Character development and establishment is also very important. I find that Chrysalis does almost no showing (more near the end) and generally sticks to telling; I hear you that LA does a lot of showing that doesn't advance the action, but I like that.

      Skip ahead! Once Red gets moving again, a lot more happens.

    It's rather intense. I enjoyed chrysalis, the last angel and its sequal are slower paced but also vastly different in scope.

    Similar to real life, when there is action, it is brutal and fast paced but the rest of the story is in the buildup and continued escalation
