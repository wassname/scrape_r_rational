  Nice, I can see complaints about the brother being a kind of young nic being too much given the cast having a fair amount of unusually precocious characters to begin with but he sounds like fun.

  Winnum Roke conversation! Absolutely dead on that finding out what she wants is the best way to work around/for it and Simole remains the best.  It'll be interesting to see if Nic optimizes or studies working out or not.  Certainly the best way is to just take the pain head on, but it seems pointless to not try to optimize it in some way given how he operates everywhere else.

  I have to ask this, because maybe I'm just forgetting or not realizing it.   


  Can anyone please give me some examples of character growth from the MC? SO much has happened in the story - major world changing, and life changing events that our MC is at the center of, and yet, I can't for the life of me see anything different from his iteration in the beginning of book 1 right after he arrived at the school. He still comes across as the bumbling introvert who can't seem to stand up for himself. Maybe I'm being too harsh or overlooking things, but that's what I'm hoping to fix by asking.

    It's rather subtle but I believe it is there.

    He started off being an off-handed "my opinion doesn't matter, it's what the scorers believe that counts" and then he gets dumped and starts actually getting emotional and letting himself be personally invested in things. He's turning from an emotionless husk to an actual character with his own opinions and values.

    >*“You have a lot of anger in you, don’t you?” said Simole.*

    He's a very repressed boy. Reminds me of the protagonist of the Johnny Maxwell series by Pratchett.

      Maybe. I suppose I was expecting something more noticeable given the absolutely insane things that have happened to him. It seems...insufficient. I don't want to presume to call it lazy or bad writing but, it just seems like it was overlooked. And that's a really important thing to overlook imo.

        >*And that's a really important thing to overlook imo.*

        At first I thought Nic's whole "I'm an unperson" shtick was a mentality Nic was "brought up" to be by Dizzy's father or some other character. Preparing him for a possession like his current mind-sharing with Roke, or something similar.

        While I do generally enjoy how calm he is in crazy situations, lack of obvious personal growth for the main character of a story does make it less interesting to read.
