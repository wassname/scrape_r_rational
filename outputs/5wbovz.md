####[Chapter One](http://royalroadl.com/fiction/chapter/115802)  

***
This is a daily serial with a standard VRMMORPG premise, at least in its initial set up, but the ones I've read tend to use VR as an excuse to get into a fantasy world and then don't really play up the game aspect other than pulling up a status screen every now and then. To me, MMOs are about more than the fantasy setting. 

Bugs, exploits, devs who don't understand their own game, OP classes, over the top nerfs, p2w, ridiculous RNG, cash shop fiasco, lockboxes, raging players, broken mechanics, limited bag space, tedious grinding and how to avoid it. And above all that, a company trying to squeeze money out if its playerbase while pretending they're just in the business of having fun. 

Of course, then there are the orcs and elves, and the occasional dragon.

This story is about finding yourself in a completely immersive fantasy game, but it's also about what a game like that would really be like.

(BTW In case anyone here reads my other story, HTADDB is on a one week hiatus. Back on Monday 6th March)

  I've mentioned this before, but I don't think most gamer stories count as "rational." In theory, they're *perfectly* rational-- RPGs tend to be fairly perfect-information, and from an in-universe perspective the avenues available to a character could be predicted from just looking at their skill tree. But out-of-universe, authors very rarely outline the in-fiction game mechanics to such a degree so that the reader can't meaningfully predict how the skills the characters use will work, or what new skills the character will get.

  So before I even start getting into reading this story, I'm going to lay out the criterion I'll use to judge whether this story fits in this subreddit.

  Either

  a.) the rules of the game are clearly deliniated well enough that a copy could be fairly well recreated in real life

  or, in what I call the "Log Horizon" approach,

  b.) The main literary conflict is actually some meta-conflict about the game, and resolved through some non-game action, such as through diplomacy or trickery.

  Expect me back in a few ~~minutes~~ hours after I've made my judgement.

  Obviously I don't have any actual power over you or your writing, but hopefully my feedback should be interesting and useful.

    I don't particularly approach my work with a rationalist mind set, but my other story got some attention here (and that was more realist than rational) so I thought this one might be of interest too.  

    Having said that, I would be interested to know what people think of it from a rationalist perspective, although it's early days and I'm not sure enough has happened to be able to get a proper view of the story (or maybe there has).

      >I don't particularly approach my work with a rationalist mind set, but my other story got some attention here (and that was more realist than rational) so I thought this one might be of interest too.

      Slight clarification to be made: "rational" and "rationalist" are slightly different, in that "rationalist" fiction is rational fiction intended to teach readers to act rationally. (You probably already knew this, I'm just making sure.)

      As of the first real fight scene (mugger), I'm kind of iffy on whether the story qualifies for [RT] though. You did explain what her spells did beforehand, but even though spells are theoretically balanced by "failure rate" I get the gut feeling that they'll only fail when it's narratively convenient, as opposed to something like rolling dice to see whether they work, then having to adapt your writing on the fly. Thus, the reader can't reasonably predict what your character's available options are, because they're dependent on a hidden variable determined by author fiat.

      That being said, while I don't think this is *rational*, as the focus seems to be somewhat social-sci-fi-y then it's probably a rational-adjacent, and therefore deserves to be on this subreddit. Anyways, it looks like I'll be following it, so thanks for posting!

        I can think of very few stories that base all random chance on dice rolls. If a character in another book gets into a fight or has to shoot something, their success or failure is generally based on narrative needs.
        You shouldn't be able to reasonably predict whole fights. you should be able to say X is a good option, if that works then Y if not I guess I would have to try Z.

      Glad to see you have started a new story! Is your other story complete? I need to catch up on it.

      FYI, clicking the above link brings up a consent form. I was able to simply click 'Decline' and view the story, but it might be off-putting to some.

  That synopsis is, well, crap. The initial coverage of "I don't like most MMO stories because they're not written by those who actually play MMOs" is far more engaging.

  I'd say to edit down that "list of things that gamers are actually familiar with but never show up in stories." and have that be the synopsis.


  "MMOs are about more than the fantasy setting. Exploits, unbalanced classes, and gold farmers breaking the intended economy. Nerfs and patches breaking more than they fix annoying the community. Raging players, tiny inventory space, and tedious grinding for that rare epic loot make one wonder if it's worth playing. And atop all that is a company trying to squeeze as much profit as they can get away with while pretending they're just in the business of having fun. "

  I liked the sound of the description, so I tried to give it a fair shot.  But a dozen chapters in, nothing of the description had really showed up.  Instead the main character mostly spends extensive amounts of time thinking and saying rude and nasty things to/about everyone, including herself.

  At this point even if the story premise does start to play a more prominent role, her head is such an unpleasant place that I don't want to be in it any more.  Sorry =/.

    That's okay, personal taste doesn't require an apology. Thanks for giving it a shot.

  So I've gotten about a dozen chapters in, some feedback.

  Your premise interests me, I can dig the idea of a VRMMORPG story that deals with some of the more 'realistic' side of MMORPG reality.

  However I think you have got to, got to, got to land some sort of "hook" within your first dozen pages or so. Something that grabs the reader and gives them a reason to keep reading your story. Usually something that engages with the theme of your story. Often I've seen it done in this genre either with a 'flash forward' to the character at a later state in development, or a perspective shift to a different character. This way you can give the reader some idea where you are heading, something to look forward to, while still doing the 'slow build' of your main character.

  So I don't really feel you've done that with this. Of the first dozen chapters, only one or two really deal with the setting material. The chapter with the dragon and the tutorial is interesting. And its the first chapter to play up on the premise you laid out in the synopsis. I want to emphasis I found that chapter really enjoyable. But it comes pretty far in, at which point I was already considering putting the book down. And from there we dive back into the real world stuff which I was not finding terribly engaging.

  Sadly it is surrounded by all this real world interlude. Now to a degree this would be acceptable, after all the 'real world' is also part of the "MMO world" and could conceivably be in scope. But the problem here is the amount of it. We are basically 10:1 real world drama to VR world drama. It feels like a bit of a bait and switch. Its kind of about managing expectations here.

  And lastly the elephant in the room. Britta. She's a bit of a, ahem 'B' isn't she? I mean I suppose that's to be expected in a story called 'Bitter.' She's not a very attractive character's head to run around inside of. She doesn't really build a lot of empathy for me. Nor does the story at this point really show a lot of arc for character growth (yet).

  So I guess you might ask yourself, "Why would the reader want to read this book?" Your synopsis tells me I would want to read this book if I was interested in seeing a "realistic" depiction of a VRMMORPG game. But the story itself tells me I should read it if I want to read the story about Britta the bitter 16 year old girl who sometimes plays a VRMMORPG.

  And I'm sure that story appeals to someone. But I don't think its me.

  But hey, you don't have to write for me. Good luck!

  This is some very harsh commentary, possibly too harsh to be useful to you. I don't want to make you feel bad. It will, but that's not my goal. 

  I read the first two chapters, and was bored to death. 

  It's not that it's slice of life, it's that it's clich√© and unpleasant slice of life. 

  Like here is all the info the first chapter gives:
  The MC is a teenage girl. 
  She is badly depressed. 
  She thinks her parents don't love each other, and that that is normal for the modern day. 
  This is in the ?future? but feels like the 90s?
  Her dad got laid off, but given a vrpod.
  He seems to think this will make money for the family.
  The mother seems to be the one that actually cares about money. 
  The MC kind of hates them and uses home work to avoid them. 
  She doesn't actually have homework to do, but does it anyway. 

  Now that last bit actually is pretty "Whoa", but also strains my suspension of disbelief. Why isn't she reading a book, or fmylife.com? Does she like actually care about school, I mean she does say that it keeps her parents off her back. So maybe it's a reasonable thing for her to do at that point.

  But that's besides the real problem. The real problem is that she is boring. There's no conflict. The only character traits she seems to have are depressed and conflict adverse. 

  Being in her head is unpleasant, and uninteresting. Mostly it's just too long.

  And then next chapter we learn she is unpopular in school. Surprise.

  The good ideas here are buried under too much clich√© and filler. I think that if cut down to a fifth or so the currant length, the scenes might work later in the book. Or cut down to a tenth or so, as introduction. You do manage to convey just how misriable she is. Her life is really viscerally boring. 

  But she doesn't have to be boring. She could be unique and interesting to the reader, while still being misriable.

  Or you could skip this entire set up for now, and wait to show the boredom until the reader has connected with her later more interesting self, and the contrast will make the misery captivating, instead of off-putting.

  Sorry about the harshness, I really think these could go places, and want you to keep writing.
