## [BST] Suppose you are the exclusive owner of a fully-functioning, two-way, low-cost time machine. How do you make as much money as possible without drawing too much attention to yourself?

### Post:

As frustrated as I am with the premise of this article: http://www.iijournals.com/doi/abs/10.3905/jpm.1986.10

Which somehow, in the pages I don't have access to, shows that due to the fact that prices are not stable over time, we aren't subject to time traveling arbitrageurs.

So how do **you** as the only owner of a fully-functional two-way time travel device get rich, but without showing a significant effect on the markets?

Assume lots of people would presumably want the power to travel in time and would likely want to steal your device, and some of them might not be nice about it either, and might be willing to kill you (or your grandfather) in order to get it. So you better keep your secret pretty well hidden.

  Use the time travel machine to win a big lottery once. This is your seed money. Winning the lottery once is hardly suspicious.

  Then use the money to start an acquisitions firm. A company that buys out failing companies and restructures them to be more profitable. Design the company such that you draft operations plans that the company then follows for months/years at a time. With someone else as the executive officer.

  Then buy out a company, and make a plan to flip it (and give it to your 2nd in command). Travel 5 years in the future to see how profitable it is. If it's not profitable, go back, try a different plan and/or company, repeat.

  From core-timeline, you'll just appear to be a business savy genius. It's not exactly low-key, but few people go from nothing to wealthiest-man-in-the-world without some public scrutiny. Maybe even throw in some big public failures from time to time to make it more believable.

  Maybe at some point you can branch out into the insurance industry. I suggest moving to Omaha first, if you go this route. Because this is basically Warren Buffet's plan-to-get-rich (except replacing "being born wealthy to start with" with "winning the lottery").

    ```
    I'd add to this: get a few R&D departments and set them to work on various projects. Using the 2-way travel, you can get them to essentially start up entirely new industries over time. Make sure you have a few failed ideas, too, to avoid suspicion. 

    TL;DR, use time travel to invent new stuff, basically be Elon Musk but better.
    ```

    - u/Terkala:
      ```
      That has the downside of being far more suspicious. Even if you're very hands off, at some point you're going to need to give them a nudge.

      Also, a lot of modern technology required many peripheral advancements to be viable. Modern computers required advancements in materials science, miniaturization, manufacturing techniques, design techniques, ect ect. Many other products are similar.

      There are relatively few cases where a new technology came along by itself. And if some lab started pumping out discoveries in 4-8 entirely different fields of research that all converged together, that would be both notable and highly suspicious.
      ```

      - u/FountainsOfFluids:
        ```
        Start different labs under different shell corporations for each major discovery.

        It might take some studying, but you could also accelerate the advancements of those peripheral technologies if necessary. Just guiding your researchers toward the right path and away from failed paths would be ridiculously helpful.
        ```

        - u/Terkala:
          ```
          That's just leaving more threads leading back to you.

          Also, while it may be a benefit to humans to accelerate research, it could also be disastrous. If you know that in the future human civilization reaches a post-solar civilization, then why jeopardize that by instituting wide-changes to the tech level of humanity before they normally would occur?
          ```

          - u/FountainsOfFluids:
            ```
            That's true. The best choice might simply be to jump to a future time where scientific advancement has created infinite life and problem-free existence.

            But if you can't find that, I have no problem fucking with the timeline in order to create that. Or at least a pleasant life for yourself.
            ```

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  Personally, I'd want to use it to optimize the timeline rather than making as much money as possible. At my age promoting the development of effective anagathics is more attractive than simply becoming outrageously rich.
  ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    In practice: I would go forward in time, see if they've invented immortality yet. If so, make myself immortal, otherwise come back and make a different random comment on reddit and try again. Due to the butterfly effect, even a minor change in the present will completely rewrite the future so just about anything would do.

    Once I'm immortal I won't need a time machine to become as rich as I want.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      The math says you would cause nuclear war and, upon exiting in the future, die immediately due to the radiation in the area you teleport to, much sooner than finding a future where immortality has been created.
      ```

            If it were possible to affect your own timeline as opposed to creating a fork with each use of the time machine, it would be impossible for you to change the past since everything you would do you have already done. 

            By this reasoning, only three possible variations exist:

            1. Time travel is impossible.
            2. Time travel creates alternate timelines, not changes to your actual past.
            3. Time travel with perfect safety precautions (artificial or natural) exists and is in use.

            Unless you are a person with a functioning time machine, there's no way for you to know which of these is true.

              Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

              In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

              Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

              “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

              The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

              Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

              Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

              L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

    I suppose that one might also attempt to inflate the size of the Powerball payout by going back in time each time somoene else won.  By going back, any number of things could be done to influence the brownian motion of the pingpong balls in the hopper.

    I wonder what the range of the "butterfly effect" might be in this particular instance.  Would it be necessary to be present in the studio? or just spill coffee on the person who starts up the machine? - anything to subtly change the time/manner in which the machine is started when they pick the numbers.

  This strikes me as akin to gaining the ability to teleport and using it to ensure that you never miss your bus again. Money is just so *limited* a goal when you have time travel.

  The first and most important question is whether this is a single-immutable-timeline universe or if it's a multiple-branching-worldline universe (these are the only two types of time travel that are logically consistent).

  If it's the immutable timeline type, you don't have to worry about disrupting the markets - they have already included the effects of your time traveling and all you'll do with your efforts is to make them turn out the way they did. So if you want to make scads of money in this scenario you'll need to do it secretly. False identities, shell corporations, buried treasure you can dig up later, that sort of thing.

  If it's a multiple-branching-worldline universe, there's two strategies you could take. One, you could try to emulate the immutable-timeline scenario by working hard to be behind the scenes. This is a lot trickier since it's actually possible to fail at that in this scenario, but on the plus side if you fail you can just jump worldlines and try again. Or two, you could just "go nuts" and steal as much high-density valuables as you can cram into your time machine and then cache them all at some point in the past before your depredations. Then maneuver from there into a worldline that you didn't otherwise tamper with.

  Personally, though, I wouldn't be so worried about wealth. I'd want enough gold coins stashed under the time machine's seat that I could get stuff done no matter where I wound up, but my main purpose would probably be technological and social betterment of humanity. I'd try to craft a better world to live in rather than trying to be rich in this crappy old current-day world.

  It would be pretty easy just to research the biggest lotto win ever, then go back to the drawing just before that. Play from a state that allows anonymity. Once you got your seed money, put together a team of investors, and nudge them from time to time when a big stock jump is coming. As others have said, if you're ever worried about looking too perfect, just throw in a couple conspicuous losers.

  I've even thought about splitting up the money and spreading it around the world and into multiple front investment companies. If any one of them is average, but you own dozens, that would be huge money.

  And as others have said, just earning money would become so trivial as to be meaningless. I'd start tackling real issues like why some countries can't shake off the civil wars and revolving door of dictators. I'd use that huge pot of cash to start up a political research group that could put together action plans that would push nations into healthier election formats (look up "The Problems With First Past The Post Voting").

  If the timeline is somehow magically consistent, like in HPMoR, precommit to having the only stable timeline be one where I travel to my current location in spacetime plus one minute with a completed fAI which also includes a clause that I get 10^20 kg of money. Otherwise I go to MIRI HQ and work with them to make it happen. Give the fAI the time machine and all of existence which is smoothly connected to me is retroactively optimised. And I have more money than has ever been minted.

  If every time travel back to a point before a parent time travel splits the universe (Terminator rules), time travel to MIRI HQ next workday, check the plan, then wait till 2035 or Armageddon to travel to a mathematician's house (probably someone recruited during the 20 yrs) the evening after. Bring them on board, repeat until the plan "fAI and a dwarf planet of cash" is complete. Then time travel to an infinite number of points in the past of all spacetime to bring suboptimality down to an infinitesimal fraction of existence. And to get my 10^20 kg of cash.
