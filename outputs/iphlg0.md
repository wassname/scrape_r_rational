## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Has anyone else noticed that urban fantasy really isn't transhumanist enough? Like, the main character finds out that there's a secret world underlying the human one with magic and monsters, and they don't even think of exploiting this to further human welfare? It's bad enough when there's some sort of magical "veil" up, (at the very least, you could come up with a plan to massively increase the amount of people under the veil who can thoroughly study it with the scientific method), but for the occasional work where humans and magic creatures coexist in the daylight, somehow the world is still basically just our own, with a few aesthetic trappings changes.

  Alicorn's Luminosity is one big counterexample, what with Bella's goals >!of maximizing the amount of vampires, and therefore immortals!<, and I suppose the Artemis Fowl series eventually ends with >!The fairies gradually starting to roll out magic and advanced tech to the humans!< but it strikes me as lazy that so few authors even consider the issue.

  The obvious solution is to just write a pro-transhumanist character, but on some level that feels unsatisfying, because why were there no transhumanists before them? Why did no one else have the idea to spread magic into the mundane world? I can think of a few justifications (illegality enforced by a corrupt magical establishment that wants to hold onto their power (Harry Potter), magic is inherently dangerous and 'evil' (Pact), no one is interested in uplifting humanity once the prospect of hot vampire sex is dangled in front of them (Twilight)). Can anyone else think of others?

    I'm writing original urban fantasy and while I definitely see the universe I write ultimately ending with transhumanism, here's why it hasn't got there yet:

    - majority of supes live separately from humans and don't care about humans (and don't have a way to make a human immortal anyhoo)
    - where relevant, supernatural beings are scared of sharing power / space with humans
    - there's no reliable way to grant someone immortality: the vampire transformation process has a 50%++++ failure rate (higher the sicker you are so don't just wait until you get terminal cancer and roll the rice, you WILL Die Forever); vampire blood keeps you alive but binds you into that vampire's service
    - vampires require a human source of blood (True Blood doesn't and possibly can't exist)
    - vampires don't understand how vampirism works
    - vampire culture got fucked up in a big way as a result of a massive and recent population bottleneck
    - werewolfishness is recessive/genetic
    - being a vampire does fuck with your brain and may turn you evil

    There's definitely ways to address the above, but it requires technology that vampires just haven't developed. 

    (I know there's definitely transhumanists on here that would jump at the chance of a 50% chance of immortality VS 50% chance of dying Right Now, but it's a hard sell for the average person!)

      I think a Masquerade also plays a really huge role. If there are strict anti-transhumanist sentiments that are ingrained into tradition, then it becomes difficult for transhumanists to do their thing, especially if the only people vaguely interested in immortality are Dark Wizards who punch puppies for fun.
      ```

      - u/MagicWeasel:
        ```
        Agreed, but I also think that if you want to break the masquerade, promising humans super powers and immortality is a great way to go about it.
        ```

        - u/ramjet_oddity:
          ```
          I can think of many humans who would not be happy with immortality.

          EDIT: would be -> would not be
          ```

          - u/MagicWeasel:
            ```
            Yes? Hence promising it being a great way to break the masquerade, because it would make humans who want to be immortal be inclined to like you?

  I'm trying to design a world (which will hopefully become my nanowrimo project) but I think I need some help with population dynamics...

  Everyone on Tauschwa has 5 lives, they are reincarnated and reborn with all their memories each time and everyone on the planet treats this as just obviously true because they've seen the evidence. New people are born, grow up much as we do and die, but they're called newborns for the whole of their first life. When someone dies they are reborn to a pregnant person who is usually relatively nearby, and their memories return during their first year or two as if they are waking up from a long illness. People are usually reborn pretty soon after death, but not always instantly.

  But what does this say about population numbers? If the population is stable, then fine, and if it's growing then you just get more newborns, but if it falls, even temporarily, there could be a backlog of people waiting to be reincarnated. Tauschwans strong believe that everyone gets exactly  5 lives, no matter what, but how can I make that work?  I keep thinking I'm missing something important - am I?
  ```

    Small declines in population aren't actually a problem. People only get 5 lives, which means that given a population in equilibrium, 1/5 deaths will be final, and 1/5 births will be newborns. To get a backlog, you'd either need substantial short-term population decline, or a sustained decrease in births. For example, you might have a backlog for a few years if you had a 20% population decline over the span of a few years due to drought, famine, war, etc.

    One important factor to consider is when the reincarnation happens - at fertilization, at birth, or maybe a year after birth? If it occurs at fertilization, there is a 30-50% miscarriage rate. If reincarnation occurs at birth, keep in mind that current worldwide infant mortality rates as of 2018 vary between 1.7 to 121.5 of every 1,000 live births. Also, if it does occur at birth, keep in mind that as of 2017, worldwide maternal mortality ratios vary between 2 to 1,150 deaths per 100,000 live births, though most of these would occur after birth rather than before. Nonetheless, you may have a not-insignificant number of women who give birth to themselves. Obviously, that number would surge significantly if reincarnation happens one year after birth.

    >People are usually reborn pretty soon after death, but not always instantly. ... what does this say about population numbers?

    This could reflect a highly localized reincarnation process, possibly with some random variation as well. Suppose that when you die, your soul starts moving around randomly in relation to your place of death (or birth? Or home?). Your soul's precise location could be modeled in spherical coordinates with random azimuthal and polar angles, and a variable distance following a log-normal distribution. Reincarnation doesn't happen until your soul actually collides with a infant/fetus/whatever young enough to accept it.

    If souls do stay close to the area where they died, then it could be fairly useful. Murderers, rapists, war criminals, and their ilk could be captured alive and then executed in a secured area far from civilization, like a remote island with an all-male guard force. If souls stay close to their area of birth, or their home, then it would be very inconvenient, since truly getting rid of people like that might require abandoning their place of birth or the area near their home.

      Thanks, you've given me a lot to think about. I quite like the idea of someone being their own mother and will maybe work that in as a myth at least :-)

      As for capital punishment, it's simply not possible in this system, unless you are prepared to kill a lot of children. The soul in your scenario will eventually wander further and go to another region to be born, which I suppose could serve to export the problem, and the reborn killer could of course refuse to say who they were in their past life.

    What kind of setting is it, in terms of technology and culture?

    World population in 1900 was roughly 1.6 billion, and today, is roughly 7 billion. In this world, that would represent an *enormous* growth in the proportion of people who are "newborn", which would presumably have some consequences for the social and political structures that they've built.

    > If the population is stable, then fine, and if it's growing then you just get more newborns, but if it falls, even temporarily, there could be a backlog of people waiting to be reincarnated. Tauschwans strong believe that everyone gets exactly 5 lives, no matter what, but how can I make that work?

    IMO, there would be some strong cultural impetus for increasing the population as much as possible in order to ensure that everyone really does get five lives.

    Interestingly, you do need to decide how this "backlog" works. You have a lot of options (these are just the first that come to mind):

    * First in, first out: The person who died earliest gets reincarnated first
    * First in, last out: The person who died most recently gets reincarnated first
    * Life increment ordering, ascending: Those with most lives lived get reincarnated first, with ties broken somehow
    * Life increment ordering, descending: Those with the fewest lives lived get reincarnated first, with ties broken somehow
    * Random: There is no order to how the backlog is cleared

    All of these would result in different outcomes if the backlog ever came into play. Narratively, I would probably like "first in, last out" best, since it means that as the backlog clears, you might get people who came out into a world that was radically different from what they remembered, two hundred years having passed.

    Perhaps, if it becomes known that there *is* a backlog, the idea that there will be a population boom to make up for it would become an article of faith for some people.

    (I don't know if any of that is helpful, or if you've thought about it before.)
    ```

      Thanks that was very helpful. I think this world is what Ursula le Guin calls post fast forward - i.e. they have had their big technology boom and now live a relatively stable life, using some excellent bits of technology but not being ruled by them. I suspect that being effectively governed by people who've lived a few times will slow things down a bit in terms of change.   


      I am assuming the reincarnation backlog works somewhat randomly, with the soul searching for a suitable host outward from its place of death, but for unlucky souls that could still mean some people having to wait a long time as well as being born into cultures they are unfamiliar with.
      ```

  - u/vakusdrake:
    ```
    One rather significant issue that hasn't been brought up is that people in this setting have no intrinsic incentive to have children. If a child is most likely to be a reincarnation with all their prior memories, the bond between parent and child just isn't tenable in this scenario. It also seems like infant death and malnutrition would be incredibly common, since who the hell would want to breastfeed some random adult in the body of an infant? So having kids only makes sense if you want to extract resources from them, such as in the form of free labor.     

    Essentially in this scenario the idea of a parent-child bond probably wouldn't exist, in place of something more akin to indentured servitude. Also if this is the case, then this species (provided evolution meaningfully applies) should have evolved radically different psychology from that of humans.
    ```

    - u/Evan_Th:
      ```
      One way around that would be to have the reincarnated person only get their old memories back around age 6 or later.  (Which, not coincidentally, is the same rough age where people graduate from the Westermarck Effect.)  That way, they'd also have memories of their new childhood and a learned bond with their current incarnation's parents.
      ```
