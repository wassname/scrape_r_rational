## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You're given a choice between two weak versions of the Death Note: a Happy Note or a Sad Note. When a person's name is written in the Happy/Sad Note, their entire utility function is modified such that they feel slightly happier/sadder about everything (by the same amount). (It's hard to quantify happiness, but let's say, roughly the amount of happiness an average person would get from hearing a good joke.) When their name is erased from the Happy/Sad Note, their utility function returns to normal.

  Which Note do you choose and what do you do with it? What unorthodox uses for these Notes are there?

      I'd go straight to the nearest facility that performs ECT, and offer the happy notebook to the suicidally depressed as fast as I could write their names. I'd keep doing it as long as the notebook regenerated, first come first served, and I'd burn the other one.

      As for rewriting utility functions, every act of speech does that; that's what language is *for.* You can limit the degree based on circumstance and immunization, but it always has a physically real effect that amounts to modifying any agent that perceives it.

      > I think it would be morally repugnant to rewrite someone's utility function without their consent. Whether we do that by just speaking to people in our day-to-day lives is debatable. I'm just going to stop considering the moral implications for now, but I wouldn't use either notebook without examining the question further.

      Definitely something to worry about. I wouldn't be happy about someone messing with my utility function either. But then, you could always ask for their consent before using the notes.

      > Want someone famous to quit using twitter? Sad note them for a few minutes every time you see a new tweet.

      LOL. That's the most petty evil I've seen on this sub. I love it.

      > Make babies on planes stop crying through introductions and small talk with their parents.

      I don't think the Happy Note is strong enough for this. Being on a plane is an absolutely stressful experience when you don't have any idea what is going on. Plus if it did work, I would be worried if the baby was actually crying for a reason. What if it was crying because it was hungry? Would the Happy Note make it stay happy and silent even while it starves to death? ^(oh hey that's an unorthodox use...) *Cough* Ahem, err... what were we talking about?

      Oh the notes, right. Huh, I guess these Notes are pretty useful for training other people's inner pigeons. You could probably train yourself with them too, making yourself feel happier every time you take an action you approve of.

    Happy note, definitely, then I'd just start writing every name I could starting with the most influential people I could think of. Our every interaction alters the mood of everyone we interact with, and the better position we start from the more likely we are to improve the the mood of the person we're interacting with.

    Every little smile, sure, but also every time we don't complain or get exasperated or fail to make eye contact. Each point of contact has the opportunity to improve or deteriorate the life experience of not just the person we contact, but every person they contact for the rest of the day, the week, the month, the year, their life.

    The ripple effects are small, but they're continuous. No matter how bad things are, no matter how bad they get, they'd be slightly better. For everyone. A little anti-depressant for the world, one interaction at a time.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
      ```
      Keep in mind that the Happy Note makes people happier about *everything*. So they will be happier about helping people, but also happier about hurting people. If you write someone's name in the book, and they turn out to be a corrupted official, they enjoy their corruption more. Effectively, writing the names of bad people in the Happy Note could give them more motivation to do bad things.

    >The above means that sharp objects inflict greater 'damage' (cost to will) on objects that aren't sharp, depending on how they collide.

    Do you just mean this as in, normal physics? Or is there an actual sharpness bonus? In other words, are we going to be rewarded for visualizing pincushion armors? Should everyone just turn themselves into Hedgehogs with spikes everywhere?

    > Larger objects, more objects, distant objects, hidden objects, objects moving independent of simulation, and transforming objects are harder to visualize--they require more will to create and maintain.

    Does complexity matter? E.g. does a crossbow cost more to visualize than a cube of the same volume? I'm assuming it does, otherwise victory goes to whoever designs the greatest tiny non-self-moving machines.

    Also what about objects that don't move, but exert forces on other objects? For example, can you visualize a magnet? Then visualize magnetic stuff and move them around with your magnets? To make this not game breaking, the visualization cost should scale upwards with the amount of force exerted, otherwise players would be able to visualize ridiculously powerful railguns. 

    > Duels take place on an infinite featureless plane with consistent lighting.

    Is there gravity? If so, the next question is how hard is it to fly? Can you repeatedly visualize a board under your feet to jump off as soon as it appears? Having the high ground offers a great advantage if there is gravity, so there will be a lot of players researching different methods of flight to find the cheapest ones. For example: visualizing compressed springs under you that immediately decompress, shooting you upwards (or in whatever direction you prefer).

    Once you get above your opponent you can just start visualizing stuff to drop on them, while they will have difficulty fighting back since they would either have to visualize stuff near you (which is far from them and thus costs a ton) or visualize stuff that moves itself towards you (which is self-moving and so costs a ton). At sufficiently great heights, you wouldn't even need to visualize heavy blocks to crush them flat. Just visualize needles, they're deadly enough and very hard to see, making them hard to dodge.

        More questions: Is the ground breakable? Can you dig a tunnel and hide inside it?

        Can you visualize gases, or things that will turn into gases? For example, can you visualize a block of dry ice, which will rapidly create a suffocating fog? (Do you need to breathe? If not, it is still a good smokescreen.)

        What about radioactive material? Does it count as a transforming object? Can I visualize a chunk of uranium large enough to explode (or any bomb really), killing us both? I would win if I visualized it closer to the enemy than myself!

    Imagine a large sphere, with a single spike on the bottom, pointing down. Imagine this directly over the opponent's avatar. The huge boulder gives it a lot of weight, and the needle underneath puts all that weight on a point - it's really simple, so it's easy to create, and if I pile my willpower into the *point* of the needle, then the rest of the boulder doesn't use much will. Sure, creating that at a distance will take a lot out of me, but it's going to be rather difficult to defend against... it should smash that point through any armour unless I'm *totally* outgunned in the Will department.

        > How would you counter such a strategy?

        Hide. If I can't be located, I can't be sphere-and-spiked; and a long, low wall will make it hard for him to tell where I am behind it. Tricks with mirrors and fake noises can also make me appear to be where I am not, hopefully forcing him to waste willpower on sphere-and-spikes in the wrong place.

        And if I can make my long wall one-way transparent, then I can hide but still see him.

          > and a long, low wall will make it hard for him to tell where I am behind it. Tricks with mirrors 

          There's a simple counter for this though: just break the walls/mirrors. Walls and mirrors are typically flat and stationary, so they can probably be sphere-and-spiked with ease for much less will cost than it took to build them.

        > Imagine a large sphere, with a single spike on the bottom, pointing down.

        A single spike is easily dodged, though the huge boulder isn't. I can think of two counters: either don't get close enough for the enemy to visualize a huge boulder above you, or put your own objects above you. Visualize a whip and spin it around above yourself. Since objects can't be visualized within other objects, your enemy won't be able to visualize a boulder where your whip is. He would be forced to visualize it further up in the air, costing more will and making it easier for you to dodge.

        Wait a tick, if there's no gases, there's nothing for the sound to travel through to reach your ears. Sounds don't travel through vacuums. Though I guess since this is a VR you could just alter the laws of physics to make it work.

  I need help exploiting a setting I’ve designed.

  Basically, imagine you have access to an alternate earth with no people in it, but otherwise almost identical to the normal world. Text, logos, and other aesthetic stuff is scrambled. It fixes itself when people aren’t around, and it usually only takes around 24 hours to reset.

  Furthermore, large enough structures turn into dungeons. Dungeons are infinite, based on the building it grew from, and as you go deeper in the warped-ness of the products, the strength of monsters, and the general bizarreness of the structures increase. A normal, fit, experienced human can go about 5 building lengths into a dungeon before being overwhelmed, more or less.

  Deliberate alterations stick around for more than 24 hours if you maintain them.

  The size required for a dungeon to generate is approximately large enough for a little kid to get lost in.

  Open air malls turn into dungeons, cities don’t. Parks, even national ones, turn into dungeons, while unclaimed or unimportant wilderness doesn’t.

  Your goal is to extract as much value from the alternate earth as ethically possible. Selling gold, jewels, and electronics is in, selling drugs is out. Donating truckloads of food is one of the things my characters are going to do.

  What other methods of money making are there? I thought of stealing paintings from a museum dungeon, and then selling authentic forgeries, as one possible method of revenue.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    What are the rules for structural transfers between worlds?

    If you build a building on the normal earth, does it appear on the alternate earth? If so, you can construct buildings with layouts designed to give you an advantage or give monsters disadvantages. 

    The next question is: is there any merit for fighting monsters? Do they drop valuable stuff? Magic equipment or materials? Do they give you experience points that let you improve yourself?

    If there are merits for killing monsters, the next question is: define kill. How does the world tell who is doing the killing? Can you build a very fragile building in the real world, transfer to the alternate Earth, then knock it down and effectively kill everything inside the dungeon at once? 

    If the fact that the dungeon is infinite somehow strengthens the structural integrity of the building, what about creating horrible death traps in the real world building? Fill it up with all kinds of horrible machinery turning it into a massive meat grinder, then go to the alternate earth and turn it on to grind up all the monsters.

    Alternatively, what about item duping? If buildings built in the real world magically appear in the alternate world, can you just construct a building out of extremely valuable materials, then go to the alternate earth every 24 hours to take it apart for materials over and over?
    ```

    - u/CreationBlues:
      ```
      So: it takes about a week for big changes like stores to propagate, but small things like product changes or display moves takes a day for already established things. That does open the idea of just stuffing a vault with gold and other valuable things, thanks. People would probably steal a gold building before you get to it.

      Yeah, monsters drop energy cores. Monsters are also based on stuff from the building the dungeon grew from. Living sculptures from a museum, power tools from a hardware store, etc. This follows the same scrambling logic of everything else, and there tends to be a lot of variety.

      Power is more like calories than xp, yes they can make artifacts, but the limiting factor is power growth and teamwork.

      Destroying a building closes the dungeon until the building repairs, and you only get the sparse stuff, weakest monsters when you level it.

      Unfortunately, that just gives you monsters that are death traps, or traps the monsters control. 

      Dungeons look like the building they came from, just proggressively more warped the further in you go, with wonkier products filling the shelves and wonkier monsters attacking you.

        > People would probably steal a gold building before you get to it.

        Do it secretly? Or rather, how are they going to steal a building in the alternate earth? They could try to steal the building on the real earth, but you can just hire guards to stop them from doing that. The building is basically a large bank vault, you just have to guard it the same way banks guard their vaults.

        > Unfortunately, that just gives you monsters that are death traps, or traps the monsters control.

        Hmm... okay, suppose a construct a building that is just one large spiraling ramp going round and round into the depths of the earth (for say 10 basement levels). I also build a large boulder outside the entrance of this building.

        When I go to the alternate earth, can i just push this boulder into the building, causing it to roll down the ramp, and crush tons of monsters into paste?
        ```

        - u/CreationBlues:
          ```
          No, you said a building that was constructed out of valuables. A vault you owned is valid for item duping.

          Unfortunately:

          1. That’s not complex enough to make a kid lost.

          2. Dungeon generation can inherently defeat that design, say, by widening corridors

          3. Monsters are going to be strong/smart enough to bypass this by the time it becomes viable.
          ```

          - u/vakusdrake:
            ```
            There's quite a few ways I can think about beating that. For one you could just add complex side passages since you would still be able to kill all the monsters on the main path. Plus if the boulder was outside the dungeon it doesn't seem like there's any reason dungeon generation would be smart enough to somehow take its use as a weapon into account.                 
            Not to mention you could just item dupe lots and lots of explosives.
            ```

  - u/DCarrier:
    ```
    Reminds me of The Daily Grind, though that's just one dungeon.

    > Selling gold, jewels,

    But those have little to no inherent value. Is that really any better than just counterfeiting?

    Do only you have access to it? Are you just the only one who knows about it? Can you bring people in? How about drones?

    I think your best option is to do whatever makes the most money and donate it to the best charity you can find. It might be easiest just to charge people to send their robots and such through and leave it up to them to figure out what makes the most money.

    - u/CreationBlues:

      Tbh, this was thought of while heavily under the influence of that work.

      The main characters aren’t altruist bots, and they’re more concerned with directly alleviating local problems rather than other types of altruism. They also want cash because money is power and it’ll be easier to be safe if they have lots of capital when they go public.

      There’s a bunch of independent groups, and the first one is going to legitimize themselves through the church. You can pull people through, but things are going to get messy while the world reacts to an infinite source of food and goods next door.
