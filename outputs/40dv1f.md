  >What did the spirit know about Zorian that pissed it off so much?

  Hahaha, maybe that almost an entire colony literally dropped dead after deciding to have business with him.

  >He was also steadily trying out new shaping exercises, writing down which ones were easiest to work with, which ones had a trick to doing them right and which ones became much easier if he did some other exercises before them. He was surprised how lacking the various exercise manuals were in regards to crucial information like that.

  It’d be pretty cool if the resets gave him the insight to become a legendary teacher for “younger” generations when (if) he successfully exited the loop.

  >Was Sudomir somehow adjusting the warding scheme on the fly or were the wards itself somehow intelligent?

  Maybe Kandrei managed to re-purpose extracted human brains as an additional intelligent defensive element to his wards, preserving some form of smouldering semi-consciousness in them for that.

  * Crystal oozes were virtually immune to physical damage, absorbed most forms of magical energy, quite fast, could shoot arrow-like shards of crystal at things that annoyed them, [..]
   * the sentence’s structure is “Oozes [were] [property1], [did action 1], [property 2], could [action 2], [..]”. Imo, would be better to move properties together and then switch to actions, for the sake of coherency. Something like:
   *  “Crystal oozes were quite fast and virtually immune to physical damage, they absorbed most forms of magical energy and hurled arrow-like shards of crystal at things that annoyed them, [..]”

    > Hahaha, maybe that almost an entire colony literally dropped dead after deciding to have business with him.

    From the perspective of something that is unaware of the time loop Zorian never had any business with any colonies of Aranea. More importantly this "Spirit" either disappeared like all the angels and demons and the colony are just covering for it by refusing visitors or isn't extraplanar and thus is one of the terrestrial spirits like the fey or elementals or potentially even a lucid/intelligent primordial (but not likely). Could be an interesting area of study, but again it could just be missing.
    ```

    - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
      ```
      Fair enough — I’m not even sure when my headcanon changed to include [beings that are aware of time loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-aAWXKZS9M#t=6m20s) (even if they can not use all of its benefits themselves). 

      Their guardian simply being absent and making them panic is a nice possible explanation as well.

    > It’d be pretty cool if the resets gave him the insight to become a legendary teacher for “younger” generations when (if) he successfully exited the loop.

    That seems more and more likely. Zorian has expressed concern that his previous choices for career paths are inadequate at his current level. His initial bad luck in mentors slowed him down, but time loop negated that obstacle. Since he had to reinvent the wheel, so to speak, he has a fundamental understanding how many things work, also a plus.

    And he will be teaching at least two people (Taiven, Kiri) once the loop ends. And he expressed desire to at the very least write a book on mind magic, because his experiences in mastering that field were dangerously painful. Literally and figuratively.

    >Hahaha, maybe that almost an entire colony literally dropped dead after deciding to have business with him.

    That would explain him being bad news, not worst news. My guess is it has precognition and it saw that if it oracularly answered its subject's queries for bad news reasoning, that would be bad news (it would see and answer that he's a time traveller, and they would know that their only chance at inter-loop legacy is subduing Zorian, so they would try, and they would fail, and thus the spirit's powers said "don't tell them", because its powers dont care about legacy, they care about linear-time survival or something. And there's your lesson about your superintelligent advisor having not *quite* your values.)
    ```

- u/RMcD94:
  ```
  Even a full chapter is never enough to sate it.

  Sudomir's ability seems strangley anti-targetted towards Zorian in a way that makes me think he knows he's targeting him but the conversation suggests otherwise. Weird.
  ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    Seems to me like the wards are self-adapting, and Sudomir can direct if he wants to as well.  Zorian thinks that the level of intelligence is too high for a mindless construct, so I imagine Sudomir has some souls or captive minds powering it.

    My guess: It's related to the angry Iron Beaks that he's loaning to the Cyoria invasion efforts.  "Hate. Grudge. Kill." was the reply Zorian got from an iron beak back in 43 when he asked if it wanted to kill more Ibasans.  Their loyalty is being forced, and if you look back to chapter 40, Sudomir Kandrei is the one supplying both the iron beaks and winter wolves to the Dragon Cultists, and not even the Ibasan forces directly.   We'll have to wait three weeks to find out the rest of Sudomir's secrets though, which will probably also tie in to the organized killing of soul mages, since none of the people Zorian mind-delved knew anything about that either.
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Nice one! The curious ominous feeling that is mentioned in two mansion invasions could be Zorian's empathy detecting wards' intelligence. When intruder is detected, system goes from dormant into active mode and its intelligence is woken up. Zorian starts picking it up, but since it is probably some not-so usual mind (necromancer warder? probably some disfigured souls trapped or something similar) he can't yet connect the dots.

      add: which, by the way, if true, opens avenues for mind attack on ward scheme. For Zorian the mind mage this could be a godsend.

    > Even a full chapter is never enough to sate it.

    Let's be honest here: if the rest of the story were to be magically published right now, we would binge read it all and then be sitting all sad. *"What, the story is... over? But... but... Why is it over, I don't want off the ride!"*
    ```

    - u/literal-hitler:
      ```
      Knowing there's no next chapter is still better than having to wait for the next chapter.
      ```

  - u/ajuc:
    ```
    This suggests selective pressure. Maybe there's also outer loop going on, and it resets when Zorian succesfully infiltrates Sudomir?
    ```

- u/literal-hitler:
  ```
  I just love the thought of this necromancer sitting at home while an invasion he's part of is happening, and all of a sudden someone not at all on his radar breaks into his house and starts analyzing his wards. With the confusion incrementally increasing every restart when this guy he's never heard of is ready for all of his traps.
  ```

  - u/TheAtomicOption:
    ```
    I'm still uncertain how optimistic we should be about that. I find it implausible that Red Robe has been *idle* this whole time just because he's not helping the invasion. If he's still looping (he might not be given that there are only two soul-tags) he's got to have been doing something he considered productive during this time. The higher level bad guys Zorian tangles with, the more chance that he'll start to encounter someone who talks to Red Robe for at least a bit every restart. 

    Here's hoping the big reveal for both Zach and Red Robe is something epic!
    ```

- u/ajuc:
  ```
  Why isn't everything a crystal ooze by now?
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    I asked the author, and being awesome they replied.

    >They need ambient mana to survive, and lots of it. They couldn't live on the surface for long, and even shallower portions of the Dungeon are uncomfortable for them. In fact, ALL magical creatures need certain levels of ambient mana to live - and the more magical they are, the greater their demands for ambient mana. They don't die immediately if they don't get enough, but they'll basically begin to starve if they move out of the area capable of supporting them.
    ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      TLDR - everything where crystal ooze can survive is either a crystal ooze, or *even more dangerous*.  Avoid the deep dungeon, kids!
      ```

  - u/memzak:
    ```
    Crystal oozes seem to turn others into crystal statues, not oozes. I suspect that (and what Nepene said) would probably be why there aren't too many. They don't spread geometrically, just as quick as however long it takes for them to spawn? (breed? mitose? evolve?)
    ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Most of the deeper magical creatures seem to be very resistant to physical and magical damage and as such it probably isn't the most dangerous thing down there, if very annoying to beings that aren't super durable and magic resistant.
    ```

    - u/JulianWyvern:
      ```
      Also, resistance to magic damage might not help them against "Save or Dies". Those disintegration beams that Quatach uses might kill the crystal oozes on the spot for all we know
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        Yeah, it was implied there are certain high level magics that can kill them.
        ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    Seems like it doesn't make them into crystal oozes, just statues.  It probably has an extremely low reproduction rate and I think most dungeon creatures are adapted to the higher mana concentrations in dungeons rather than the outside world.
    ```

- u/thefreegod:
  ```
  I wonder has Zack delved into the deepest parts of the dungeon?  Seems like the sort of thing he would do.
  ```

  - u/Saffrin-chan:
    ```
    Well he is a guy who just decided to take out a dragon just because. Deep dungeon diving sounds like his. But then again, the dragon has some intelligence, so who knows Zack's reasons for taking it out, or if it will become relevant in the story again?
    ```

    - u/Kodix:
      ```
      > or if it will become relevant in the story again?

      If this question comes up in relation to Mother of Learning, about anything, the answer is yes. Alllwayyys.
      ```

- u/desertfudge:
  ```
  I think the reason the wards appear to react intelligently is that Sudomir stuck a bunch of human minds/souls into them, granting them a limited sort of intelligence. He is a necromancer, after all. Granting life to inhuman things like spell constructs seems like the sort of thing he would do.
  ```

  - u/BoilingLeadBath:
    ```
    Yes. I'm not sure how it works in this fiction, but I don't see any reason to think of it such an "intelligized" warding model as anything less that a (perhaps partial) transfixion of a soul to a object.

    Under which model, it is interesting to ask who the soul donor was. Seems to me that powerful wards in your house are the sort of thing you'd want to be friendly. It would please my sense of aesthetics if it was his wife, but in that case I can't imagine getting real confirmation out of Sudomir.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      That would have a nice ring to it, wouldn't it (the wards being powered by Sudomir's wife). But.. How would you negate them, if there's a friendly human consciousness/soul providing an active defense?
      ```

- u/TimTravel:
  ```
  Observation: if soulkill removes people from the loop, then he can determine whether he's still in the loop by checking if they still look dead. That will prevent accidentally overspending resources in the true timeline. It may end up being obvious once the loop ends but we don't know for sure that it will be.
  ```

- u/Nepene:
  ```
  I didn't do this before, so, cheap tactical observations.

  The golem+ alchemy combo is obviously immensely powerful for storming positions and fighting. It's worth experimenting with ways to enhance this. Can he convince his classmates to make him potions and golems in return for limitless cash, for example? Can he learn how to do mass alchemy, perhaps from the witch, so he can make a huge quantity of attack potions?

  The iron beaks and super trolls are both powerful weapons and enemies. Next time he's in Cyoria he should do some research on such magical creatures, see if there's an expert who could help him. It's very wasteful losing so many of his expensive resources fighting them. I assume he's pretty good at handling undead from Alanic, but check with people there to see if they have any cheap ways to handle undead. Maybe go ask Alanic if he has any good tips on handling liches beyond don't.

  The lich summoning amulet warrants further investigation. If he can reliably summon the lich that's a good way to target an assassination attempt or a grab and mind rape attempt. Perhaps he could mass produce it and jam the summoning signal. He could either investigate it at the end of a loop or teleport far enough away and underground that its signal won't reach the lich under lots of wards.

  He's facing powerful wards that can defeat a number of his spells. It would be worth next time he's in Cyoria asking the resident ward master Ilsa about them, to see if there are ways to better punch through them or evade them. 

  He's facing a necromancer now. It's worth finding the location of all these shifter tribes and asking them for soul magic help, as with the Aranea. Some heavy duty soul wards or defenses would help a lot, and if she knows useful stuff about soul magic they should too- there surely are shifter mages who specialize in messing with other shifters.
  ```

- u/Xtraordinaire:
  ```
  So, the memory packet is about to be opened. The anticipation!

  What I don't understand why Zorian insists on entering Iaksu mansion via gate, and being solo to boot. Hire army of mercs, enlist Taiven and Alanic (undead are his thing) and storm the place arriving by conventional means of transportation.
  ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    Because then Red Robe finds out who he is?
    ```

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      Er, how exactly he does that? It won't make any splash until after the mansion is raided. And then the loop ends or, hell, Zorian force-resets it to be sure.
      ```

      - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
        ```
        Because red robe knows there are two other time travellers, and for zorian to enlist help from people he knows might be traceable back to him. Not to mention, the enemy might have mind-readers on their side. Zorian is good at mind magic, but most people he could recruit are not because it is illegal to use mind magic. All it takes is a bad encounter between an ally who's not a mind mage, and an enemy who is, and all the details that Zorian needed to tell his allies in order to recruit them could get to red robe.

        EDIT: He HAS recruited people to help him with the bigger issues involving the time loop and the invasion, he just does it VERY sparingly.

  EDIT: Oh yea, I'll use this comment to actually discuss the chapter after I've read it.

  EDIT EDIT: Fun chapter, but - as usual - I now want more. Was it me or was this one shorter than the ones before? It had many interesting facts, but seemingly very little plot development. Then again, that's just what I feel. There could be a lot of plot secreted away within the setting of the scenes.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  It's min-maxing time boys! With the loop reset switch he can now learn soul magic and so much more. Already in this chapters he's learned so many new spells. With danger being only a distant threat now Zorian can min-max to his hearts content. Zorian is going to be a lean mean fighting machine by the time this second arc wraps up. At this rate Zorian will be the type of mage that will revolutionize magic, like he dreamed of when he was little.

        He figured out the only way to affect things in the loop again, was to time travel to back before the entire thing started... Does that make him a masochist or a sadist, when it comes to their private lessons?

        - u/melmonella:
          ```
          Neither. If you remember, "getting the fuck away from Xvim" was one of the main motivations for Zorian at the beginning of the book. I would argue that he is actually the perfect teacher for him-forcing him to improve himself, making him do the very very useful shaping excercises, never asking questions as to why the hell he is so flipping good and never running out of stuff to teach, even within the time loop.
          ```

          - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
            ```
            I would disagree vehemently. A perfect teacher for Zorian would be teaching him fat stacks of useful spells during the time saved by actually explaining how the hell to achieve a given shaping exercise, instead of just throwing marbles at him for months without even telling him how he was supposed to sense them.

      Yeah, I'm sure everyone will have their own script. :P But this sub actually prevents reposts. That's how I know that a chapter has been posted already.

      The biggest problem when posting is to: 1) post when it comes out. My email didn't ping me like usual, so I tried 2 minutes too late. 2) know what the title is. Everything else is predetermined.

      We're gonna buy servers that host the closest to fictionpress to get the lowest ping. We're gonna write our scripts in assembly to ensure they are fast. That means no bloated curl. It means writing your own drivers for the firmware to bypass kernel. No, we're gonna write scripts that are in the firmware of the networking card. Scratch that, we're gonna make specialized networking cards for this very purpose.

      On second thought, it might actually be faster to hack a script into fictionpress' servers to post immediately when Domagoj presses the post button. (For all police reading, I have no intentions to hack anybody.)

      /s :P

      I just realized that posting this is the /r/rational community's way of saying, "First!"

          http://www.meltingasphalt.com/social-status-ii-cults-and-loyalty/

          I'd recommend you read them both, they're very interesting. He actually writes:
          >Today I'm offering a red pill (of sorts): an eye-opening account of social status. I won't say there's "no turning back" after reading this — but I've seen down the rabbit hole, and it's indeed as deep as advertised.

          >If you decide to join me (warning: long), by the end of this essay you'll know most of the important things I know about social status. There are wider and more practical perspectives we could take, but today we're going straight down, i.e., into the theoretical and evolutionary roots of the thing.

          Again, as a member of /r/rational, you have to read interesting articles. :P

        Have you considered simply bribing Domagoj to let you know the title and exact time of posting beforehand?
