  I'm still really depressed over how this turned out. This honestly sucked, and I still feel a sense of heart-wrenching pain at the memory of Inoue telling us to "Piss off."

    Look at it from her point of view.

    We just threatened a senior Konoha ninja in front of an even more senior Konoha ninja in front of witnesses. Like Mari said, we basically fucked a ton of Jiraiya's political sway right then and there.

    At this point Jiraiya has to decide if we're worth keeping around, and a lot of that will depend on how much Hazou claims it wasn't intentional. Mari telling us what to say, comforting us, or speaking to us in any "positive" way whatsoever would have been points against that, and further ammunition against Jiraiya if he keeps us alive.

    Mari telling us to piss off is exactly what she should have done in this situation.

      I know, but it still hurt.

      It was not in front of public witnesses, it was in front of spies. We work for him, we raised our concerns up the chain of command, took no action, and after disrespecting him, were chewed out.
