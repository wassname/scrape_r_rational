  Moody usually publishes on Amazon.  I really hope that he does with TGS soon.  I would like to throw some money his way.

  Download the [webtoepub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webtoepub/akiljllkbielkidmammnifcnibaigelm?hl=en) Chrome extension, go to to the royalroadl version of the story, then use the extension.
