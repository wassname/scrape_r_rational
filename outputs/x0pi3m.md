## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  *Demonology and the Tri-Phasic Model of Trauma*, a *Good Omens* fic. Don't know anything about *Good Omens*, but it was still readable. Crowley, a demon, goes to therapy with an admirably disciplined and effective therapist. Felt like I learned something, though I'm not sure what. Maybe it was just a powerful reminder of all the ways spoken words can go wrong.

    I can't remember any other fanfic, and very few published works, that got this strong of an emotional reaction out of me. Definitely recommended.

  Better Call Saul ended two weeks ago, and I'm surprised no one's beaten me to recommending it yet.  Its writing is intelligent and well-crafted to a shocking degree - forget surpassing Breaking Bad in that area, I think it might be the series I've seen in recent years that's had the most *thought* put into its characters. 

  I usually lean toward letting people going in with natural expectations and having that guide how they enjoy the show, but I know multiple people (myself included) whose experience would've been much better if we hadn't expected the show to be like Breaking Bad at *all*.  BCS relies far more on slowly drawn out character arcs, but the more important distinction in my eyes is what each show relies on for its more immediate enjoyment - where BB relishes Machiavellian manoeuvering, dominance plays, and intricate plot, BCS thrives in audacious pranks (bordering on the absurd), serious comedy, small-scale courtroom drama, and silence where the actors are left to their craft.

  If I'd gone in with the same mindset I watched the last two seasons of the show, Better Call Saul might have been one of my all-time favourites.  As it stands, it still gets an [S rating](https://jozdien.notion.site/TV-943ad1486e11453b8dbc354d2802c25e). The last season in particular, I think is one of the best seasons of television ever made, and it still blows my mind when I think about how long ago the plot in the beginning of a 13-episode season seems.

    ```
    I have a limited capacity to watch characters in fiction struggle and suffer without growth, or do ethically bad things with no redeeming acts to follow. I wasn't able to dig into Breaking Bad for this reason. Do you think I would enjoy BCS more?
    ```

    - u/jozdien:
      ```
      Short answer: I think you might enjoy it slightly more, but not much.

      Longer answer: >!Better Call Saul does (in my very personal opinion) a better job of making the characters' choices seem driven by circumstance - until the very end, there's still a case to be made that Jimmy (Saul) was just shoving his pain away, that he was trying to be a good person and failing.  I think that's still an incorrect overview, but it felt more believable than in Walt's case.  Same goes for Mike, where even though he ends up the same criminal lieutenant he was in BB, you can see him trying again and again to be a good person.  As for growth, the characters all grow from their struggles and suffering, but in most cases toward becoming even darker or deeper into safe masks.!<

      Spoilers for the last episode because it might be relevant, but you might not want it included with lighter spoilers about the show: >!Jimmy and Kim (one of the other protags) do eventually separately own up to everything they did, even the stuff no one ever caught, years after they both could've gotten away without much consequences - for Jimmy, it was finally facing everything he'd ever done and making the right choice for once, growing into a person who tries to make that choice now even when it's not convenient or easy!<
      ```

- u/zaxqs:
  ```
  Does anyone know of a fiction with a protagonist who is a true example of "politician for a good cause"? Like a protag who is capable and willing to engage in machiavellian/realpolitik fuckery to gain power, but through it all keeps a strong internal moral compass, and uses it to truly change their country for the better?

  I guess I just want some awesome moment where the protag sees their chance to seize power and push forward their true agenda after spending the entire time building power and pretending loyalty to the dominant regime, and have it all be for a truly good cause.

    I don't know about *strong* internal moral compass, maybe incidental moral compass, but [A Young Woman's Political Record](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-young-womans-political-record-youjo-senki-saga-of-tanya-the-evil.660569/) should be a good fit.

    The first thing that comes to mind is the glowfic: ***[in color](https://glowfic.com/posts/803)***. It is essentially a story of a civil rights struggle in an alien society of near-humans with a deep cultural obsession with hygiene and a strict caste system that would love to massacre the entirety of their untouchable caste the instant they have an alternative to dealing with their dirty jobs. Centers around a family of people who all, in one way or another, work to prevent this genocide and re-integrate the caste into society without bloodshed. Aitim is the politician among them, and he seems to fit your criteria. Spends all his time creating and exploiting every lever he can find to nudge policies in a more bloodless direction. That said, he is often a background presence and you don't get that much focus on his day-to-day.

        I took the repository down because the person [whose code it was based on](https://gist.github.com/HalCanary/f9291e75122e60b10ed46dbfd1f272ab) complained.

        Hmm, I'd be impressed if the average person can use the script tbh. It's quite barebones by most standards.

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    That's the plot of The Traitor Baru Cormorant and the rest of the series. I've heard good things about it, but the first book didn't really grab me enough when I tried it. Felt like the rest of the characters and world weren't fleshed out beyond what was critical to the plot and I couldn't get invested, so I dropped it most of the way into the first book when the pace slowed between major arcs. The politics and stuff is well done, it just didn't feel like things mattered outside if what happens in the head of the protagonist, and while that does reinforce her motivations to ignore everything in favour of her cause, it's not something I found personally interesting. Also the explicitly anti-LGBT stuff the empire does, while rightly seen as horrific by a lesbian protagonist raised by a triad of parents who has one of her fathers disappeared by the empire, was not something I was keen to read about.
    ```

- u/Dent7777:
  ```
  In the last recommendation thread, /u/WholesomeBastard recommended The Belisarius series by David Drake and Eric Flint as a limited uplift fic.

  I finished the first book, An Oblique Approach, a day or two ago. I very much enjoyed it, with strong dialogue, a powerful plot with real stakes, and great battle scenes, both in combat and maneuvers. The writing is strong all around. So far, the uplift is restricted to military inventions, but that may change in the future. 

  The only con is that the mc, Belisarius, does come off as a bit of a Mary Sue. From the starting point of a historical top ten military leader all time and from explanations made in text, it makes sense, but don't come in expecting grimdark marches of failure after failure.

  I am looking for a fiction with a unique/interesting power. It does not matter how powerful or weak it may be, as long as it has potential to allow me to think about its utility.  It can be fan-fiction as well, preferably in a world where superpowers are commonplace
  ```

  - u/ThePhrastusBombastus:

    Worm fanfiction is great for this. There's so much of it, with such a variety of authors, that a few are going to get really creative with the powers they write about. These are all dead, and of varying quality, but the powers are definitely pretty interesting in my opinion.

    [Paradox](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/paradox-worm.370435/): power featured is the ability to travel ten seconds back in time... and then die. Or well, disappear after a short period of time. So the user of this power will never actually use the power, because they only survive in the timeline where they never use the power.

    [Skein](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/skein-worm-altpower-au.437953/): word association power. Not mind reading, but a close cousin? Power lets the user follow the web of word associations a person has. I believe the user can also modify others' associations, but it's been quite a while since I read this.

    [Camera Shy](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/camera-shy-worm-alt-power.685357/#post-51134179): actually a set of four synergistic powers. The user is blind. When observed, the user can 'see' through the perspective of those that view them. When unobserved, the user can enter a black-and-white frozen world where they can see anything that 'isn't' observed. In the frozen world, the user can fly and phase through objects, but can only interact with the world by 'smearing' objects. Smeared objects move once the user leaves the frozen world. Cameras count as observers, but can be disrupted with an EMP ability. Due to the nature of how the power was aquired, there are three other individuals with similar powersets.
    ```

    - u/lo4952:
      ```
      Unfortunately, Camera Shy really falls short in a few areas, including by making Taylor the POV character.

      The story starts off with my the MC being blind, except not really, because she immediately has two separate powers that let her see. The disability isn't compensated for or explored - it's immediately trivialized and never matters again. 

      Then, the story proceeds to explore the timestop power in the worst way possible - by dragging out every little decision that Taylor makes in frozen time via her POV, to a frankly ludicrous degree. Entire chapters will pass that cover a 'ten-second' fight with thousands and thousands of words and minutes of internal debate and planning. Seeing Taylor teleport around from the outside would be interesting - instead, it's mind-numbing. The power is one that should appear in a videogame, not a book.


      On the other hand, Skein is great. Definitely second the recommendation.

    [The Path of Ascension](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40920/the-path-of-ascension) is one of my favorite ongoing stories on Royal Road. While I think there are rightful things one could say about the writing, one could never say it isn't always *cool*.

    A very rough description is that it's a xianxia done in the style of a sci fi story. Characters exist at Tiers of power and channel essence to reach the next one. At Tier 15, you achieve effective immortality. At Tier 50 reality itself boots you to another dimension in response to your sheer existential weight.

    At Tiers 1, 3, 25, and 50, however, a character gains a Talent.

    Talents are unique abilities that are essentially super powers. The main character's is crazy strong while being one of the less interesting Talents in the story. So without too much context and blatantly unmarked spoilers for minor characters, here are some of my favorite talents off the cuff:


    •The main character has nigh-instantaneous mana regeneration, but only to 10% of his maximum capacity. That said, he can double his maximum capacity at each Tier. Eventually he will be regenerating more mana per second than his peers will have in totality. Again, not my favorite, but very powerful.

    •A woman who can transport objects she sees to and from a pocket dimension where she can dilate time as she pleases. As she has Tiered up, the dimension is now large enough that a planet and its citizens have been brought to live in it. Any attacks she suffers are shunted off into this dimension where entire generations of the planet have more than enough time to deal with them. Similarly, researchers and engineers live on the planet and are able to produce results in outside seconds.

    •A mage that builds up a combo streak as she casts spells of different elemental alignments. Each blast is costs more, but delivers a more-than-proportional increase in power.

    •A sword fighter that has a gift for calligraphy with pens, quills, and other writing implements. She is slowly training her power to accept other objects as writing implements. While she's struggling to include a penknife, her ultimate goal is to expand her power to the point of, "writing," with her greatsword.

    •There's a Young Master who has conceptual clones of himself that he is able to constantly train through. A clone works out 24/7, a pair duel each other as one imitates a future enemy, etc. The gains from each clone are not individually large, but between their ability to work without stop and their number, they're able to make up for it.

    •The emperor is MegaMan, essentially. He's able to copy others' talents and mix-and-match them. During his perspective, we see he has fully developed, "builds," like one would have in a rpg.

      Also, do you or anyone else reading this comment have any recommendations for Clone/Clone-like power stories. Again, this can be fan fiction.  


      I have read waves arisen fanfic, but I did not like it all that much as even though it was rational, the story as a whole seemed really sub par.

    Two stories I really enjoyed like this that come to mind are:

    - [Paranoid Mage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49879/paranoid-mage): The MC has teleportation powers. Urban fantasy. One of my favorite ongoing fics.

    - [The Perfect Run](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/36735/the-perfect-run): Time stopping + limited time travel powers. Also urban fantasy.
    ```

  - u/None:

    Industrial Strength Magic on Royal Road. The author has other more litrpg stuff with unique powers, like kidnapping princesses for buffs, but they are not super-hero themed.

  I've noticed a trend in Pokemon fanfic to make the world much darker, so looking for reconstruction fic that *doesn't* make the world extremely dark or violent compared to stuff in the games. A little bit of darkness is fine, I'm just not interested in a world where Pokemon are violent beasts and every faction is run by murderers

    There's been a glut of new Pokemon Self-Inserts on Spacebattles recently. Here's the three I'm currently reading:

    [Borne of Caution](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/borne-of-caution-pokemon-isekai.849292/)

    Probably the fic that inspired the current trend. A zookeeper isekais into the Hoenn region during the events of Ruby/Sapphire. Pokemon are intelligent like in the anime, but the MC's experience handling animals gives him an edge in understanding/working with them. The first chapter is pretty dark in how it potrays him getting isekaid (with nuclear holocaust instead of good old Truck-kun), but it's pretty rosy from then on, and it is relevant to the story in how it affects the MC.

    [Hard Enough](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hard-enough-pokemon-si.1008721/)

    A Brock SI that starts a year before the events of the Pokemon anime. It's mainly a slice of life showcasing a much more competent Brock taking care of his family and his gym, with some big Pokemon battles and politics sprinkled in. Honestly, this one could've just been a decent AU if not for SI Brock's outside game/anime knowledge.

    [Pokemon Trainer Vicky](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/pokemon-trainer-vicky-pokemon-si.1028636/)

    This one's probably the most generic SI on the list, but it's been fun so far. SI is born into an AU Pokemon world where Pokemon knowledge is less widespread, and she uses her outside knowledge to build a small powerful team of Pokemon before even going on her journey. Very lighthearted and fluffy.

  - u/TheColourOfHeartache:
    ```
    You might try On Lavander Tides. It's not a pokemon fanfic, but it is a pokemon inspired setting in a wholesome world.
    ```

  - u/anenymouse:
    ```
    [Traveler](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8466693/1/Traveler) is dark-ish but not like super dark it makes pokemon potentially lethal but like I'd argue no more than like a bear would be to us proportionally. I mean considering the fantastical powers involved with pokemon it makes sense for them to be potentially able to kill people even if for a number of reasons they don't do so a huge amount. I mean people die in our world to like snakes, cows, dogs, hippos, etc.

    [Olivine Romance](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1609088/chapters/3425729) uhh warning nsfw I think the author also warns about it in the little bit before the chapter but I feel like it should be mentioned anyway. In this fic pokemon are much more animal than like the anime portrays them with some intelligence but not the same level as like being our peers. Also much more equivalent to a real life AU that takes what's shown across anime manga and games and kind of applies it as though people were living through the conditions and just follows through on internal consistent logic for the most part.
    ```

- u/megazver:
  ```
  Here's a couple of RR stories I've been reading recently:

  ***

  [Dao of the Deal](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/54762/dao-of-the-deal) is more or less xianxia Spice and Wolf. A guy transmigrates into the body of a young poor itinerant merchant in a xianxia world, in which if someone cares enough about their calling in life, it actually becomes their Dao and they become cultivators. (If someone actually teaches them how.) He has a fortuitous encounter where he meets a mentor figure who can help him make his first steps as a cultivator, and focuses on just trying to become a successful merchant. 

  The story is well-written by webnovel standards and is mostly slice of life; it's not as laboriously wholesome as Beware of Chicken, but violence so far has been limited to a few instances of self-defense, mostly against beasts, and the MC is rather reasonable and non-confrontational for a xianxia MC. 

  *** 

  [Immortality Starts With Generosity](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/56949/immortality-starts-with-generosity) is a combination of several classic xianxia setups. The MC wakes up in the body of a despicable black sheep young master and discovers that he lives in an exile far away from the main clan, feared and despised by his servants and, as he discovers by the end of the first chapter, is a part of a conspiracy which involves marrying a beautiful, badass, totally-the-actual-MC-of-this-story cultivatrix to his villainous ass in an elaborate xianxia plot to humiliate and, eventually, destroy her.

  Obviously, now that his body is under new ownership, he doesn't go along with it and manages to convince her to become allies and continue their sham marriage, while working together to deal with their perspective issues. Now this is where some of you ask "oh and do they slowly start realize that their fictitious relationship is slowly turning into a real one and there's smooches?" Well... not quite yet. But *hopefully soon*.

  Also, since this is xianxia, the MC gets the mandatory cheat power - whatever he gifts to someone who actually doesn't hate him (so, pretty much just his wife so far) returns to him 100x fold, so he pretty much goes full Gomez Addams on her. This is purely material - he gives her a magical item and receives one a hundred times stronger in return, but the power doesn't multiply, like, *kindness*. 

  So yeah, this isn't really cozy fantasy or wholesomecore or whatnot; the MC has to maintain cover and hide his ignorance in a cutthroat xianxia world, so while he tries not to *do* anything unethical, he keeps the (somewhat toned down) arrogant and aloof facade. The dialogue with the people he gets to actually have conversations with is mostly fairly spicy back-and-forth banter; I think it's fun and well written, as is the story in general, but I've seen people react with "oh no, why are they so mean to each other?! D:" (I think they're all Americans, haha.) The MC's female counterpart is, likewise, better written than her typical counterparts in the chinese xianxia novels. Overall, good shit.

    My recommendation is don't do it. There are some decent TTS systems out there, but so far none (publicly available) come anywhere near the quality even a bad human narrator produces. 

    There are plenty of free audio recordings: ranging from serialized podcasts to fan-read passion projects to even plain free audiobooks a-la project Gutenburg. Then there's local libraries which often offer digital borrowing of audiobooks and if you can't find anything there and aren't willing to pay, you can put on a tricorn hat and sail the high seas.
    ```
