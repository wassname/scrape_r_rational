## [Biweekly Challenge] Anime/Manga

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4booom/biweekly_challenge_precognition/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "Precognition". The winner was /u/Roxolan with their story, ["The benefit of foresight"](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4booom/biweekly_challenge_precognition/d1lkw2b). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/Roxolan on their first win!

##### This Time

This time we're doing /u/kishoto's choice (for getting five wins), "Anime/Manga". Any submission needs to be fanfiction of some anime and/or manga. I'm not going to be super-strict on definitions; manhwa or Korean webtoons are fine, as are [OEL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_English-language_manga) manga. Same goes for anime. If you're picking something really obscure, a description or link to the source might be welcome. Other than that, go nuts.

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, April 20th.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* 300 word minimum, no maximum. Post as a link to Google Docs, pastebin, Dropbox, etc. **This is mandatory.**

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Think before you downvote.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in the companion thread, and will be aggressively removed from here.

* Top-level replies must be a link to Google Docs, a PDF, your personal website, etc. It is suggested that you include a word count and a title when you're linking to somewhere else.

* In the interest of keeping the playing field level, please refrain from cross-posting to other places until after the winner has been decided.

* No idea what rational fiction is? [Read the wiki!](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/index)

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Next time, the challenge will be "Cat and Mouse". Give us a story about hunter and prey, with the option for role reversal. In some ways you might consider this a subset of the asymmetric warfare.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 4/20.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread [can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4dpsry/challenge_companion_animemanga/).

  **Yugiohnai! Episode I: The Heart of the Cards?**

  Destiny has chosen him to *defend* the world from the return of the shadow games, not to embrace it. Now Yugi Moto has to figure out how to obtain and destroy all of the Millenium items before they turn one of his favorite games into a ritual of dark magic that could destroy the world.

  It's time to d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-duel!
  ...Or not!

    ```
    Liked it, but reads very much like a prologue. Its 90% original with one shift to indicate teh more rational characterisation

    I was suspecting the twist to be that the rational response is to take off the edant and never ever play again?

      ```
      Also there's no Tristan/Honda in the story. He was a completely pointless character in the original story.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Iirc he' a relic from the prequel/original manga where him and joey were originally introduced as a pair of bullies, Joey got character development and he didn't

  [Bayesian Beats](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zsyTXpbVjTMHKVVAs8BvJHL61ut2MnYkJOlHYY5_S-s/edit?usp=sharing)

  Only managed to write chapter 1 in time, but I feel it stands fine on it's own with 2205 words. I do have entire plot outlined already, and intend to finish the rest of the story  within a week or so hopefully,  when I'll publish it all at once (Chapter 1 is likely 10-20% of the whole plot).

  ```
  [Pokemon: Rational Origins](http://blog.bondsandkindness.com/pokemon-rational-origins-episode-1/)

  5279 words

  Planning fallacy screwed me so I only managed to barely write an introduction but I think it serves its purpose. I will finish it in my lifetime probably.

  so far untitled, (3791 words) http://pastebin.com/mDfLi7Xw

  Fanfiction of From the New World/Shinsekai Yori. (http://myanimelist.net/anime/13125/Shinsekai_yori) It ended up being a lot longer than I initially thought, and I didn't get to finish it in time, so this is only part of it. I'll post the completed version in the days to come.
  ```

- u/MultipartiteMind:
  ```
  [Connecting the Dots](http://pastebin.com/AQEustKz) (559 words).  (Something I originally considered in terms of the 'Genre Savvy' prompt.)
