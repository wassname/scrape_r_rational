  This is sort of amazing as a story, and just really a good read. Many horror elements. Bills itself as irrationalfic, for extremely obvious reasons if you read it. Writing quality is astounding. Story is amazing, thought provoking. 

  Found this while reading Nostalgebraist's tumblr, originally posted by tumblr user somnilogical. Edit for clarity: The author of this story is Benedict_SC, I just was mentioning the chain of users I found out about the story from.

    Excuse me? This was written by Benedict_SC, whose tumblr is itsbenedict.tumblr.com.

      Sorry if my post above was unclear. I found out about the existence of this fic because Nostalgebraist responded (positively) to a post on Tumblr about it. The origin of the post Nostalgebraist was responding to, which was just asking that people read the fic, was written by somnilogical. The writer of the story is indeed Benedict_SC.

  This story has the best opening paragraph I've seen in a while.

  A very enjoyable read. Dramatic irony [doesn't get much better than](#s "watching characters repeatedly outwit themselves to death.")

  I think my favorite thing about this work is the complexity of each character's theory of mind, and the realistic failures to properly model one aspect or another. [e.g.](#s "the character with the alphabetic INO using a primitive pattern-matching technique to fuel their 'rational' paranoia, followed by the character with the numeric INO recognizing and exploiting this weakness. (Only to be bitten in the ass later when said pattern-matching actually DOES produce some 'winning' strategies to their detriment!)")

  The [ ](#s "trans") characters' identities and [ ](#s "their carefully-chosen pronouns") were a pleasant surprise, too.

  I'd rather like to see how the SCP Foundation would deal with this particular [](#s "K-class end-of-the-world scenario.") I think an enjoyable crossover could be written detailing the Foundation's involvement in the development and deployment of [](#s "the amnestic antibody.")

    I imagine at this point they would use [SCP-2000](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2000)

      I agree this would be an ideal solution... [](#s "except the elephant spores are now presumably irreparably ubiquitous. As long as a single spore survives, knowledge of the elephant is an existential-threat infohazard. So presumably before Procedure Lazarus-01 can be enacted, first either a cure must be effected or all spores must be verifiably destroyed.")

        I think WoG is that the spores die out after a few months with no host.

  Managed to kill myself within the first few paragraphs. Not sure if this is a good or bad thing...

    I got it completely wrong. From the title of the fic, I thought it was like _Prototype_, with the protagonist "being" an organism that had actually infested their brain and was in the process of gobbling up their memories.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      You can tell that's not the case from: [Spoiler](#s "Someone wakes up in a mysterious facility with no memory of how they got there. **This turns out to be the ideal state of affairs, and is swiftly ruined**.")

  Speculation: Magician's INO index is... [2?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magician_(Tarot_card\))
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    He is the same person as "Old Fool", right?

      HOW DID I MISS THAT.

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      Ah, [of course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fool_(Tarot_card)! Never made the tarot connection before now.
      ```

- u/protagnostic:
  ```
  What was up with Magician? Why did he initially have the impression that he was immune to the 'elephant'?
  ```

  - u/Benedict_SC:
    ```
    He was, initially- I wanted to explain that later, but there was never really an opportunity.[ ](#s "There are some older people with degenerative brain disorders that can't remember things properly, such that it interferes with the elephant's life cycle. As they discovered, this situation isn't *stable-* it's an alien lifeform, so for it to work on humans at *all* it needs to have some capacity for adapting to unusual brain architectures.")
    ```

    - u/gryfft:
      ```
      I got the impression he was a carrier. Which, I now realize, is something of a pun, the mail carrier being a male carrier.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        Huh. He *was* the first explicitly male character in the story. Coincidence?
        ```

- u/want_to_want:
  ```
  Good story! But I wish it was more serious and less Tumblr-y:

  * pink elephant
  * heads exploding
  * they they they they they
  * peanut allergy and lactose intolerance
  * online friendship + random love confession
  * ...
  ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    The only remotely tumblr-y thing there is the gender neutrality. Pink elephant? *Peanut allergies?*
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      And, as it turns out later [minor spoiler](#s "the protagonists have a very good reason to be "tumblr-y" about gender pronouns - they're both transgender.")
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Trans people don't real, they're fabricated by those tumblr teens.

        *looks at self* wait, shit,
        ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    literally what's "tumblr-y" about any of these things? are you just offended about gender neutral pronouns?
    ```

  Arc...

  I can't quite tell if this fic is rational or not... On one hand, both characters do actually take the time to think, something I see a lot in rational fics. And, when the perspective shifts, each character is shown to not only have distinctive personalities, but also distinctive minds (they think differently, and this is explored quite well), something I also see quite often in good rational fics. But I don't know enough about rationality to actually know if the characters (the main characters or the doctors) were acting rationally, or if they just thought they were...
  Anybody want to clear this up for me?
  ```

  - u/Benedict_SC:
    ```
    I didn't really think of it on that level, actually- it was kind of in the back of my mind, but since the scenario was contrived to make it such that acquiring useful knowledge and reaching correct conclusions is a *bad* thing, I'm not sure it would have helped if they'd used specific rationality techniques (hence the "Irrationalfic" tag.) 

    (I did write the two main characters to be *smart*, and some of that's going to be informed by my having read the Sequences, but I didn't actively work to double-check their logic and make sure they were really behaving optimally.)
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Well, Arc was always taking the idea that everyone was more likely to be their enemy, and a competent one at that, first before even remotely considering the possibility of benevolence, coincidence or even just general incompetence in anyone.
      ```

    - u/Lugnut1206:

      this story is wonderful, just wanted to say that
      ```

    - u/itisike:
      ```
      Latest xkcd [is relevant](https://xkcd.com/1664/).
      ```

  - u/Bowbreaker:
    ```
    Arc seemed to either work off of pretty bad priors or simply applied his intelligence more for rationalization than for rationalism. Sometimes he even seemed to use Occam's Razor backwards!
    ```

- u/chaosmosis:
  ```
  If you use a strict enough definition, it is very easy to intentionally avoid thinking of an elephant. Generally, my first thought when I hear the phrase "don't think of an elephant" is to recognize that the phrase is a trope. My second thought is to imagine a cartoon Dumbo. My third thought is to imagine an online photograph of an elephant. My fourth thought is, "it is very easy to intentionally avoid thinking of an elephant". If the phrase "don't think of an elephant" is interpreted to mean "don't think of any particular elephant", I have it very easy, since I don't actually know any elephants, and so I am perfectly safe from memetic infection. Naturally, this is the interpretation I favor.

  Great story, the author really nailed the ending.
