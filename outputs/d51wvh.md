## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  ```
  [Darkest Before Dawn](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/8075/darkest-before-dawn) feels kind of like pony HPMOR except the students are younger, the teachers aren’t idiots, or treated as idiots, and the tone is slice of life.

  [Delve](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/25225/delve) was recommended to me and I second it. The opening to the story is cliche and bad but after that it gets better. I’m not sure that this is really rational—it seems more munchkin-y than anything. Good quality LitRPG though, without any stupid unique skills, god-given powers, or insane luck.

  [The Scientist](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5301182/chapters/12238256) was recommended in the past, and I heartily second both the fic and the entire series. It’s Undertale and manages to incorporate the random mishmash of things shown in the game without coming off as contrived or stupid or annoying. The later works in the series also portray depression well.

  [Message in a Bottle](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/368986/message-in-a-bottle) is still a really good science fiction first contact story that realistically explores an AI that’s gradually downloading updates in the background. The writing itself is professsional, the plot is interesting, the characters intelligent. If you dislike the ponies, just treat them as aliens that happen to have equine bodies. It’s basically the truth anyway.

  [Vainqueur the Dragon](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26534/vainqueur-the-dragon) is a rare story with a dragon as a main character. It’s fun, but it isn’t rational and it isn’t supposed to be.
  ```

    IMO if you liked Delve you'll also like [He Who Fights With Monsters](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26294/he-who-fights-with-monsters) - it's another LitRPG with a neat system, and well-written. 

    The main character *is* somewhat Marty Stu-ish, but it's not quite as bad as Siphon (yet).
    ```

    - u/Lightwavers:
      ```
      I’ve checked it out before and disliked it immensely. This time I went all the way to chapter three. It didn’t get any better. Is it one of those stories that starts out terribly and then suddenly becomes good?
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        Nah if you didn't like it by chapter 3 you won't like it.

          ```
          Ah well. Thanks for putting it out there. Maybe someone else will like it.

          - u/Flashbunny:
            ```
            I would personally argue it depends on exactly why you didn't like it. If it's because the main character comes across as an idiot, then while his *personality* doesn't change, his apparent competence does, at least from my perspective. Everything else is more or less as the beginning implies, though.

            We've already established that we have different tolerances for some things, though :P

  - u/Tuftears:
    ```
    I decided to peer at Message in a Bottle based on your suggestion of treating the ponies as 'aliens that happen to have equine bodies.'  It definitely makes the story more interesting that way.

    ```
    If you're looking for stories with dragons as a main character, there's [Endless Stars](https://endless-stars.com).  It gets pretty good reviews, and there's nothing else quite like it.

    Debatable whether it's rational, but there's depth to the worldbuilding, and it's at least among the better webfictions.

  Recommendation: [Lord of the Mysteries](http://novelfull.com/lord-of-the-mysteries.html). I'm sure many of the regulars here know of it (and even more saw it when it was recommended out of this thread a few weeks back). Well, I saw it for the first time then and decided to pick it up... and I am hooked. I've binged, uh... 308 chapters in the past week. So there's that. Pros:

  * World-building is fantastic. Good supernatural power system structure that is unveiled over time; this goes hand-in-hand with the geopolitical setting that gets fleshed out as the story goes on, and the world history that keeps coming into play.
  * Rules are fairly well-set, though they do change a bit as more information is revealed in the form of artefacts and journal entries. 
  * The writing (or translation, at least) is just... SO much better than what I've been slogging through in LNs. I was rereading Mushoku Tensei recently for a nostalgia trip, and going from that to this is like going from a middle-school book report to a university freshman's pretentious debut. That is to say, it's definitely not perfect, and the ideas behind it may not be any better either... but reading it is just so much more enjoyable than a lot of translations I've slogged through.

  Negatives?

  * Might be a personal quirk, but I'm not used to Chinese translations overall. The chapters often seem to abruptly end without any sort of anticipation or build-up. There is also a lot of (seemingly) unnecessary word space "wasted" on flowery descriptions of food, fashion, etc. This isn't really "bad," but it makes the chapters a bit wordy at times. I've heard it's because Chinese web novelists are paid by the word... but I have no idea if that's true. But hey, I've suffered through worse, and it DOES help build the world quite well.
  * The protagonist seems to abandon his original quest - "Get back to my actual home world!" - really quickly. Which I kinda understand, because living in a fantasy world with superpowers, special abilities, and extraplanar knowledge that you can exploit is AWESOME. But his thoughts never progress in that direction. He just kinda... forgets about his original goal? One could argue that his pursuit of knowledge and power is all to allow him to get back, but there's been almost nothing in 300 chapters about him missing his previous life, or family, or friends, or suffering from the repercussions of suddenly being ripped away from them and thrust into an entirely different universe. It seems like a glaring oversight for something that should have been (and continues to be) extremely traumatic.
  * At times, new abilities and information are "shown" and not "told." That's actually ok - it's boring to be told "I can do this" and then the next chapter is "So I did this." But one of the things I really like about rational(ist) fiction is that you get told info up front, then get to theorize how it will be used to solve problems as they crop up. Here, several times, it's been more like "OH! A problem! Good thing I prepared this ritual/artefact/weapon in advance. Here's why it worked!" So it's more about enjoying the journey than putting yourself in the protagonist's shoes and thinking about how he's solve his problems.

  Quibbles aside, it's really good so far!
  ```

  - u/IICVX:
    ```
    There's actually quite a few dropped plot threads, like the kid Ian who disappears for a couple hundred chapters and then reappears with little fanfare only to exit stage right yet again. 

    Also, I like how the metaphorical GM keeps on dangling plot threads in front of the MC, and he resolutely refuses to investigate them until something happens and the situation somehow blows up in his face. 

    Like the subplot with Talim the equestrian teacher's love life(?), where Talim keeps on dropping hints and going nudge nudge wink wink there's something to investigate here, and the whole time Klein just says "nope not gonna do anything about that" until he gets railroaded in to it.

    Its boring to read about this stuff, you can imagine that there was plenty of it in the time skipped months. 

    Similarly, MC rarely thinks about Ince Zangwill, but never wavers in his desire to get revenge.

      >Its boring to read about this stuff, you can imagine that there was plenty of it in the time skipped months.

      Eh, I disagree. For example, I think a lot of the reason that readers enjoy Worth the Candle is because the protagonist keeps flashing back to his old life and the issues he had. Granted it's a different sort of plot (WtC is likely about the protagonist's attempts to deal with his previous mental health and relationship issues, so it makes sense to keep going back to it), but it still feels like an oversight that the protagonist has so little concern over his previous life despite his stated goal of returning to it. 

      It very much feels like the protagonist in LotM only thinks back to his old life for random knowledge or cultural references, not to how he lived his life or to his loved ones. He early on completely adopts the persona of Klein, and doesn't even think of himself internally as Zhou Mingrui any more. To me it makes the protagonist come across more as a vehicle for moving the plot forward than an actual person.

  Two related requests:

  * Are there any Portal Fantasy works focused on the exploitation of advanced social, political, or economic knowledge to enact a one-man industrial/social revolution, as opposed to the usual technology/science/convenient magic systems? Whether it be done by stirring up rebellions, leading political campaigns, or playing intrigue among the upper classes. Ideally with the protagonist having no other tools at his disposal — no magic, no technological know-how, only this relatively "soft" power.

   * *Worth the Candle*: >!Uther obviously did that to an extent, but a) the story is not focused on Uther, b) he had a lot of other advantages.!<

   * *A Hero's War*: >!I recall both protagonists employed this to an extent, but neither was focused on it: Cato enacted a technological revolution, Morey had military power.!<

  * More broadly: Any works heavily focused on the manipulation of social systems?

    Hrm, *The Merchant Princes* series by Charles Stross mostly fits, but there's a fair bit of travel between Gruinmarket (pseudo-medieval) and Earth. Here's a TL:DR from the author:

    > TL:DR; it starts out looking like "modern person ends up in mediaeval society", but its mission is to systematically trash every cliche of that sub-genre that I could get my hands on. With a side-order of development economics and cultural commentary (the moderns don't come off particularly well, but neither do the quasi-mediaevals).

    Get the omnibus version if you can, it reads a lot better and cuts out a bunch of fat. The later books deal with the social systems aspects a lot more than the earlier ones, though that's always a central focus of the series.

    More of a guilty pleasure, but also the first 3 books of the [Red Rising Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/117100) by Pierce Brown builds up to it.

    I like to think that Asimov's [Foundation series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series) does this on a larger scale.

    You might be interested in [The Red Lands](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/14278/the-red-lands). The main character - a fairly apt businessman - isekais into the body of a dying fourteen year old boy in a low fantasy slum (as one does). He starts out with no resources in the middle of a harsh winter, and claws and scrabbles his way up from there. 

    His success generally comes through manipulating the town's social systems, whether by building other slum kids into a cohort of followers with useful skills, or leveraging his previous life's business acumen to negotiate deals with the local trader. 

    He himself doesn't get any magical powers up to the point I've read, though magic powers are available (if difficult and risky to acquire).

    The prose is a bit awkward, but I read up to chapter 87 and intend to continue at some point.

  Any recommendations for LitRPG stories that are complete, or at least relatively late game? I've really gotten into the genre, but it seems all the stories get a few tiers into the tech tree and either give up or get totally bogged down in plot and the leveling slows way way down until the author stops writing.

  I'd love a bunch of actual well written late game fights where the protagonist has had plenty of time to build up their power and has an even fight with an opponent that is roughly on their level. It seems like it's always either them being drastically underleveled and somehow winning based on their "special" power, or just being totally overpowered.

    Huh. Now that I think of it, I know the author said that [Worth the Candle](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/25740126) is in its later stages, but I can’t think of any good LitRPG stories that are finished. There’s [A Bad Name](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-bad-name-worm-oc-the-gamer.500626/), also in the later stages, also really good, but also incomplete.

    ```
    I can't really think of any. Maybe [Dungeon Lord](https://www.goodreads.com/series/219164-the-wraith-s-haunt) but the MC mostly powers up in terms of building his armies and resource base rather than personal power; in fact I'd say the personal power scaling is relatively shallow: There's a scene in the 4th book where the MC fights someone with dacdes of experience and Experience over him and while there's never any doubt that he'll loose it's not a question of 0-damage vs instant win.

        It’s the ultimate in deconstructive fiction. It starts off that way, but reveals depth to each character along the way.

Be warned that anyone can die.

  A brief review of The Boys, the new superhero drama from Amazon.

  Worm did it better. Of course, that's a very high bar to set, and overall I found the first (and so far only) season to be quite enjoyable and at least somewhat intellectually stimulating. The story is somewhat predictable, but still manages to be engaging. Mysteries and backstories are explained, rather than handwaved. Injuries are permanent unless there's a good explanation for them not to be. The obvious power differential between supes (the world's linguistic equivalent for capes) and normals is explored in detail. Politics and social issues surrounding supes are explored in a cynical, but realistic way.

  What the series does really well, though, is character work. It shares with Worm the characteristic of characters feeling like people who do things which make sense given their characterization. I can't think of a single instance of anyone breaking character, actually. Everyone feels like someone who could actually exist, given the world depicted were real. While there are no truly rationalist characters, people use the intellectual and other resources they have to achieve their goals in ways which make sense. The primary villain reminds me a little of Quirrelmort. I repeat, *the primary villain reminds me a little of Quirrelmort.* They aren't as intelligent, nobody in the series is, but they are also a person of iterated masks. I was honestly surprised by the reveal, even after seeing everything else they'd done, of exactly how deep their rabbit hole went.

  The series' primary weakness is power conceptualization. Unlike in Worm, where Legend does everything Superman can through a single, well-defined mechanism, *The Boys'* Homelander is just as poorly-explained as canon Superman. It is unclear what, if any limitations supes in this universe have. The only supes known to be bulletproof are the ones we see actually get shot, everyone else is up in the air. Their Invisible Man variant is the most well-concieved of the bunch, but he still handwaves the problem of being blind while invisible. The origin of supes is explained, but the full capabilities of this origin are unknown. Power munchkining is nonexistent. If that was your primary interest in Worm, you might not like The Boys.

  The Boys functions mostly as a social commentary on modern social issues and politics which happens to be set in a universe where superpowers exist. It teaches no rationalist lessons, the worldbuilding isn't terribly deep, and it doesn't feel at all like a history of a world told from human perspectives, the way Worm did. The characters, however, save it for me. You want to find out what happens to them next, and so you keep watching. That's enough for me to give it a positive grade.

  Trigger warnings: offscreen sexual assault, homophobia (presented in a negative light), drug abuse.

  Representation of cultural backgrounds. Zero GSM characters that we know of, though the overall character base is still relatively small, and there is an in-story reason for none of the supes to be gay.
  ```

  - u/ianstlawrence:
    ```
    I watched The Boys, and I am not sure I can really recommend it like you did. I think it might be one of the better superhero stories out there, but for me, at least, it still really falls short of the mark.

    One thing you didn't mention, that I think is a huge difference is that The Boys doesn't have anything like the "Triggers" of Worm. So, when you see some villains or not very nice super heroes it doesn't make any sense. To me it really, really felt like it was grimdark, but the kind of grimdark where things are really, really shitty for no reason.

    Also there are speedsters in the show, and they don't just win everything, despite that being exactly how that would have to work. I think there is a very good reason that there is no "Flash" in Worm.

    I am trying to not post any spoilers, please let me know if you think anything crossed the mark or if you want to know more about why I didn't like it.
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      tangential to triggers, I thought it was a little odd how in The Boys, >!Nobody (on-screen) really questions where the powers come from. Eventually, of course, we get the big reveal that they come from this drug injected into people as babies, but the reveal fell a bit short because we, the audience, had no idea what the state of knowledge was before that point. Eventually we learn that only americans have supes, and it seems like most people believe the powers are god-given to americans because 'murica, and it while I buy that a lot of idiots believe this, it doesn't make *any* sense for this to have been the scientific consensus!<

      Anyway, I enjoyed the show a lot (despite its edginess), it was just this one plot point didn't feel quite right.
      ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Very mild spoilers going forward.

      I thought this world was grimdark in all the ways the real world is, what with corporate dominance of politics and the like. Perhaps it was exaggerated, but we don't know how deep that rabbit hole goes in our own world either. I will agree the worldbuilding was shallow by comparison to Worm, but again, that's a high bar.

      The speedster does technically win every fight or get taken out before he realizes it's started. The last one wasn't the fault of his power, after all. His power appears to just be going fast with the bare minimum of required secondary powers to not instantly splat against the sound barrier, and those required secondaries appear to only be active while he's going fast. Again, though, power conceptualization is definitely a weakness of the series, and I don't recommend it to munchkins.
      ```

      - u/ianstlawrence:
        ```
        I think it was mainly the personal character flaws that I found rough, no the corporate or political grimdark-ness. In Worm you have the reason for powers happening to people tied directly to their trigger, meaning that for every hero or villain you can understand why they might be so flawed. But it feels like every hero in America is not only flawed but morally abhorrent. Which is pretty weird, most people aren't just casually morally abhorrent. 

        In terms of the speedster, he shouldn't be able to lose a fight. If you are a speedster then you operate your powers you have to be nearly invulnerable (super strength and incredible resilience to deal with the amount of stress going those speeds cause), and you have to be able to perceive the world at nanoseconds or attoseconds. 
        Or, something like the speedforce. But we know its not the speedforce due to some of the training he does.
        Which kinda makes the inciting action in the plot not work at all. 

        The other thing to keep in mind is that unlike the real world that we live in, this world was created by people. All decisions were made consciously. And so the random chance of everyone sucking isn't there, and character triumphs and disasters should feel earned. 

        I don't know. The world rang very hollow for me, overall.
        ```

    - u/ProfessorPhi:
      ```
      Hmm, I agree that it may not be explicitly rational, but it does have much more extensive political and social commentary than most works on /r/rational. 

      I sort of see it like recommending breaking bad here. Good shows that aren't really rational.
      ```

  - u/ProfessorPhi:
    ```
    Hmm, I think the boys has done far more social and political commentary than worm did, and I don't think either is a fair criticism to make. The powers and world are secondary to commentary and i wouldn't judge the show based on the fact it's superpowers is more a setting than an actual plot point. 

    I will agree that if you liked worm for the world building and the powers, you won't love the boys, but if you enjoyed character dramas, you will enjoy the boys.

  Can someone recommend me a readable and interestingly written book on the neuroscience and psychology of memory? I would be particularly interested in such topics as how working memory works and how it creates the sensation of the "now," the present moment in which a certain amount of sensory inputs, thoughts, and memories combine and seem (but are not really) to be taking place at the same time; how much data is really stored in long term memory vs how much of long term memory retrieval is the brain using intelligence and imagination to "unzip" compressed memories from relatively sparse descriptive data; and various other topics that I am unaware of.

    [Celestia Sleeps In](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/76290/celestia-sleeps-in) and its sequel [Onto the Pony Planet](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/132779/onto-the-pony-planet)

    [Arrow 18 Mission Logs: Lone Ranger](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/13616/arrow-18-mission-logs-lone-ranger)

    And then I have a list of pony isekai of the more garden variety sort:

    [Quantum Castaways](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/27429/quantum-castaways) (It's probably never going to be finished, but I'm putting it first because it's so good anyways.)

    [School of Hard Knocks](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/55531/school-of-hard-knocks)
    [Not Another Human In Equestria](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/65678/not-another-human-in-equestria)

    [A Voice Among the Strangers](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/95461/a-voice-among-the-strangers)

    [Through the Well of Pirene](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/73404/through-the-well-of-pirene)

    [Solitary Pinion](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/128268/solitary-pinion)

    [Xenophilia: Advanced](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/115322/xenophilia-advanced) (Fair warning, this story is safe for work, but the story it's a recursive fanfiction of is an NSFW unapologetic wish-fulfilment-fest, even if the worldbuilding is still really excellent.)

    [The Roomate](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/23103/the-roommate) (the rare reverse-isekai.)

    [You do not belong](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/23095/you-do-not-belong)

    [Miller](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/61995/miller) and its sequel [Millie](https://www.fimfiction.net/story/92472/millie)
    ```
