## [No content, just announcement] r!Animorphs update delayed one week

### Post:

... I've bought a house and am moving into it!

In the meantime, I'd love any theorizing about just what the hell you think all of the known players on and around Earth are up to.  I have Thoughts and Plans but at least five or six times over the life of the fic y'all have come up with something much better than what I first thought of.

  Visser Three and Marco are planning on dinner at the Olive Garden this Friday. Marco doesn't know it, but Visser Three is going to *propose*. * swoon * 

  Also, a lot of people are going to die when they try to crack open the Mars base, which I'm sure V3 has filled with awful things.

  Congrats on your house. I see you have finally run out of storage room for ideas, and must upsize in order to keep them all organized. 

  I don't think anyone's pointed that out yet, but I wanted to compliment you on the comparison of the Visser and Jake when it came to the idea of self-sacrifice. The Visser looks at Telor's self-destruction and goes 'Why? That is illogical, but I must prepare for that kind of betrayal in the future'. Jake looks at the Marclones and goes 'Why? ...it's their choice, and I must prepare for that kind of loss in the future'. 

  I know I mentioned it in a thread or two ago, but I really do think the Visser could use some empathy. His choice to isolate himself and only listen to himself (completely going against his nature as a Yeerk) is slowly building up to bite him in the behind.

    I think that was more of a "Huh. I didn't think they'd have the guts to do that" kind of reaction.

      I believe this was edited somewhat in the ver2:

      > He sent another command, and information from the human internet flooded the screen.

      > Betrayal.

      >There was no anger or frustration.  There was, if anything, a begrudging respect, tinging the boundaries of a larger surprise.  **For all that self-sacrifice was a nonsensical move**, it at least required uncommon courage, and he would not have thought Telor capable—had made no plans for that contingency, except in the general sense of having attempted to ready himself for disasters of any magnitude.

      >An expensive lesson.

  Hopefully the first thing they do is have Temrash crawl into Rachel and try to repair the damage. Or at least, someone can morph her, turn her consciousness on, and relay her part of the conversation via thought-speak. Maybe Temrash (or Maninho, if he and Tobias get back to the others before the cradle does) can make sense of Rachel's morph visions. I think it's odd that Temrash hasn't discovered the Ellimist memory from when Helium woke up, especially since he was actively thinking about Ellimist interference in Yeerk and Andalite minds right before the fusion dance with Aximili. If he goes into Rachel's head specifically looking for clues in the moments after she woke up from the coma and each time she demorphed, maybe that will be enough to put the pieces together.

  The *New Day's Dawn* obviously doesn't have weapons, but I bet it has a supercharged version of the Chee personal force fields, especially if it was built after the Howlers came. It could probably do some damage in a space battle by projecting its shields right through the middle of the enemy ships' engines. (I'm assuming Pemalite shielding tech wouldn't be bothered by the presence of Yeerk/Andalite "shields".) Maybe the good ship puppydog can open the Mars base safely? I wonder if it can find the Z-space bridge? Deactivate the mines?

  I really really really hope they remember to share all the relevant morphs with each other: Elena, Quat, off-world adventure team; before the cradle shows up.

  **Edit:** The Puppyship sick bay is probably even better than what the Chee can do on their own. At the very least, it should be able to burn off morph control tissue safely.

  Not directly related to the prompt, but I've been rereading, and while pretty much everyone has an internal Marco, I've noticed that Rachel's internal Marco seems a lot chattier than other people's internal Marcos. Like, a LOT more. And that her internal Marco manages to be more coherent and focused than she herself is, when she's dying at the hands of Visser Three. And then I noticed that she mentioned noticing herself echoing the thoughts of certain people post-mesa, which I was previously writing off as natural after you run around in someone else's mind. And *then* I considered the thing that was happening the last time we saw her, where she was downloading from her future self, and I'm wondering now if she wasn't getting more out of morphing than she should have been, even before her death.

  Or maybe not precisely that. Maybe there's some other connection between those things, or maybe I've misread entirely. Don't want to speculate too much when we still don't know what exactly happened to Rachel at the end of that most recent POV chapter. But everyone else was at the Mesa, too, and it seems like the others do a lot less of the Marco thing on net. And Jake morphed into Cassie some insane number of times, waking her up every single time, but it seems like he only ever flashes back to the things she specifically said or did, rather than thinking in direct lockstep with her, or conjuring up a Cassie tulpa.

  Conclusions: I dunno! None, as yet. Just something I've been thinking about.
