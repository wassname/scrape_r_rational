  A full commitment's what I'm thinking of

  You wouldn't get this from any other guy

    I was reading this comment while listening to Vidya Intraweb playlist, as it changed to "Chrono Trigger - Rick/Robo Roll". Just a coincidence, I'm sure.

      Nothing is a coincidence.

  I wonder what Robin sold her soul for.  She might say "nothing in particular," but the fact that we *don't know what it was* makes me think it will be at least a little bit relevant during one of the final chapters.
  ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    So she wound up in Hell, giving birth to Malia Ngo. The fact that Ngo was where she was allowed Ana to power the Black Sail, which allowed her to catch Leviathan. This *might*, if our speculation is correct, allow her to learn the Explicit Name from the Captain, assuming he is Metatron.

    At that point, three people will know the Explicit Name due to SCABMOM. How one of them might manage to get into Hell is another question entirely.

      Dylan may already be in hell, so Ana -Erica-Dylan may work?
      ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        Erica could be there as well.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Yep. Ana felt a massive "loss" telepathically in the last chapter.
          ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    Not only do we have "nothing in particular" in reference to a binding deal made at great cost, we also have a "promise me" in reference to an unspoken oath.

    Placebomancy demands these be important.

    I'm trying to tie the deal to an existing character's story, but I can't think what it would be.
    ```

    - u/Mowtom_:
      ```
      I think that was a promise that TCK wouldn't give up and would use Robin's descent into hell as the motivating factor it was meant for.
      ```

      - u/ZeroNihilist:

        I thought so initially, but the conversation as laid out would be a little confusing:

        > For an hour and forty minutes, they lay there on the bed. They held each other. They talked about Nathanda, and Caelius, and Jinxiang, and Sohu. They talked about the time they met, in the dining room of the palace, and how confused Father Ellis had been when Jalaketu asked him to officiate their wedding.

        > Finally, Robin said: “Promise me.”

        > And Jalaketu said: “I promise.”

        Also, I don't think she really needs to extract that promise from him. The point of her going to hell is that it will be sufficient motivation on its own. If she expected him to give up it would be a pretty poor plan that wouldn't be significantly improved by the promise.

        nah, she was securing his promise that he would save her bastard baby and rear it as his own in his fortress at Winterfel, never telling anyone of its royal blood.
        ```

    Having a child? She seems to have left out that whole sex thing and it sounds like a dodge
    ```

    - u/Mowtom_:
      ```
      The sex thing was Thamiel's idea though.  That wasn't what Robin traded to get, it was something more she traded away.
      ```

      - u/monkyyy0:
        ```
        How he made her pregnant may have been left out of the details of the deal to sweeten the bait?
        ```

        - u/Mowtom_:
          ```
          I'm not following.  Whatever Robin traded for was *her idea*.  So anything that Thamiel suggested, such as forcing her to have sex with him, couldn't have been what she traded for.  Robin didn't go into it planning to create Malia Ngo because she wasn't planning for Thamiel's addition to his end of the deal.
          ```

          - u/eltegid:
            ```
            She could have asked for a child: 'I want to have children'. And his condition was that she had to have sex with him, which makes some sense.
            ```

  ```
  >*And the bitter groan of the Martyr’s woe  
  Is an Arrow from the Almighty’s Bow*

  Bow = front of ship (which breaks the rhyme, but whatever), therefore the "harpoon" that *Not a Metaphor* shot out is "the bitter groan of the Martyr’s woe" and the ship itself is (or is owned by) God?
  ```

- u/monkyyy0:
  ```
  So what exactly is the 7th aspect of the world?

  Blinding rage? Hidden terrible serects? I somehow doubt it's knowing demons exist but they seem awfully connected
  ```

    ```
    Evil?
