## Interactive web serials?

### Post:

So I was thinking web serials would be a cool way to take Fair play who dun its to the next level.  
Once in a while the author asks for the audience's take on something - a characters motivations, the answer to a mystery, their best guess for what some other character will do, that sort of thing.

And their conclusion will be the one the main character gets to as well - so they get to see how right or wrong they where and face the consequences.

Was this done anywhere already, or better yet, is there one ongoing?

  [Marked for Death](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/marked-for-death-a-rational-naruto-quest.24481/) is a quest written by me and /u/Velorien that has been updating twice a week for 3.5 years now.  After each chapter, the readers vote for what the protagonist should do next.  The game is ultimately based off the Naruto anime, but has been *heavily* modified in order to rationalize the setting.  Still, if you think that magical ninja kung-fu punch wizards attempting to uplift a deathworld sounds like fun then you should definitely stop by.

  You can post suggestions in each page, and it may be taken account to create the next page.

  It's still ongoing now, but it's like 80% done maybe
