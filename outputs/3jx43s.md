  Well, Stateman Urda shows up.  I'd like to know if anyone guessed what she was concerned about before she said it.

  If you didn't guess what she would be concerned about, let me know if I left enough clues that it seems logical, looking back.

    As a first reaction, nope still don't see it.

      [Ah, I was trying to](#s " use his guards, Hiro especially, to suggest to Allen that he had something to offer, experiences of worth, and try to poke at him and see if he would try to take up any sort of authority for himself, by letting him go off in the woods with small groups of trainees.  Urda and the officers, at the same time, were intentionally irritating him to see if he would try to take up authority for himself out of frustration.")

        . . . That I can see, the long game *shakes head* not so much.  Allen is very much a shut up and multiply guy.  Not to say he isn't ambitious, but his social grounding makes it clear to me that the power he'd want is a better farm.  Considering, the height to which the officer corp actually seems to be good at judging people, I'd be surprised if they thought that was a concern. At least, without them taking action that clearly demonstrated themselves as an enemy, and not a reasonable investigator using all moral options. It doesn't make sense for the LT to be concerned about a rebellion though I can now see where you were working that, and even guess a few might be intentional catspaws of his if he was worried; it does makes perfect sense for the statesman, but I guess I was too in Allen's shoes to see him being assessed for that threat.

        It was obvious for me because of the discussion here about previous chapters pointing out Allen's growing political influence, but if I was reading straight through without the enforced waits between chapter updates it wouldn't have been nearly as easy to see.

        The main factor is that Allen just isn't the sort of person who is greedy for power/control and with such a deep immersion in his character, I know I would have had not been able to guess at Urda's model of Allen's behavior since it's inaccurate and he simply won't being staging a takeover anytime soon.
