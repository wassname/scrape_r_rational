  Like Maddo said, the space battles in this are a joy. I look forward to Sunday's for this story. 
  I love how this story has the same vibe as the expanse. Like this future could happen, it's just a matter of time.

  I enjoyed every second, as usual. 

  The space battles are always so detailed, it's fun to read.
