### Post:

Replace the term "magic system" with "power system". Why? Most posted here are highly uninventive, mostly because they cling to concepts like runes, souls, elements, and wizards that are magic's traditional ephemera. Magic as in abilities we don't have in real life is fun to explore; I think distancing that word would free people from limiting connotations.
