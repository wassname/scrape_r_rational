## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You have actual fortune telling abilities, but the universe isn't deterministic.

  You can activate any crystal ball to make it show a future that is randomly chosen from all possible futures, under the following restrictions:

  * You can specify an exact time for the crystal ball to show, but the time chosen must be at least 1 hour in the future.
  * To activate a crystal ball, you must press one of your palms against it for 10 seconds.
  * You can adjust the viewpoint of the crystal ball to any direction and anywhere within 2 meters of yourself in the future. It turns completely black if the viewpoint's distance from future you exceeds 2 meters.
  * You can have the crystal ball follow someone else's future instead of yourself, by having both you and your target person place a palm against the ball for 10 seconds when activating it. Nothing happens if more than 2 people press a palm against the ball.
  * If the target is dead at the future time chosen, the crystal ball turns completely black.
  * A crystal ball remains active for 1 minute before returning to normal.
  * Once you activate a crystal ball, you must wait 1 hour before you can activate it or any other crystal ball again.
  * The visual quality of the crystal ball depends on how transparent and spherical it is. If it is perfectly spherical and transparent, the visuals will be as good as reality.

  Note that the future chosen is uniformly random among all possible futures. This means you can somewhat influence it by pre-committing to certain actions. For example, if you pre-commit to cleaning your room in 1 hour, most of the possible futures 1 hour ahead will show you cleaning your room. It can never be absolutely certain however, since sheer random chance can always block you in some way.

  What can you do with this power?

    TL;DR written after the rest of this: Mine your potential future timelines for knowledge from humanity's possible future technological advances by pre-committing yourself to study a technical field of choice and prepare accumulated knowledge for local broadcast at specific times. Use the knowledge gained from the crystal to advance that field and increase your own freedom to act, focusing on changing the probability distribution of the future towards stability and technological advance. Pick a new field and repeat. Continue until dead or until you win.

    >-----

    The distance limitation is fairly straightforward to circumvent for a lot of things. You just set up your environment beforehand so whatever you want to learn about has observable local effects. One example is looking at real-time market data on a computer. You don't need to send the crystal ball out into the world if you arrange to have the world come to you instead.

    Only being able to activate it once an hour pretty severely limits how densely you can sample the future, but if needed you could set up a high-density sample of a time significantly into the future, like spending 100 activations on a specific time a week from today. That would be good for a situation where you need to more accurately assess probabilities, but I'm not sure what that would be.

    You might think lotteries would be a good thing to scry, but it only works if the winning number is not chosen stochastically. That tumbling cage of ping pong balls could go a lot of ways, you'll only see one of those ways per activation, and if it's designed well a large number of scryings will just confirm that their process is very uniformly random and that all the balls come up with equal probability.

    Anything relying on information not being publicly revealed before a certain time is immediately broken, since you can just scry that time for the information. Pre-commit to finding the answer and writing it on a note on the table in front of you. It'll usually work and you can easily verify when the plan failed, since the most likely failure mode is not successfully learning the information, and you can just send messages to yourself about the failure regardless.

    Actually, that brings up what might be a really interesting avenue to explore further. Because the universe is not deterministic, pre-committing yourself to writing down information on a sheet of paper on the table doesn't mean you will *actually* do everything needed to cause that to *actually* occur. You can steal information from *potential* timelines and use it to go to a *different* timeline. The trick is the shift in futures - you have to pre-commit yourself in a way that means you will almost certainly complete the task, as long as you don't *already* have the information. Then once the scrying is complete of the timeline where you don't have the information and had to go get it, you can *actually* go into *another* timeline where you didn't do any of that work because you already had it from the crystal.

    Because there is no stated limitation on how far into the future you can look (besides lifespan), you can mine *all of your potential futures* for information. One where you spend thirty years studying genetics and absorbing the accumulated knowledge of the field, one where you spend thirty years studying robotics, etc. These scrying attempts will generally provide good information because the possibility distribution for human society is likely to be filled with progress more than non-progress. Even if you pessimistically assume that technological civilization only currently has a 10% chance of even existing in thirty years, you can just scry ten times more to find the information from the timeline where it does.

    You'll have bandwidth limits to overcome. Maybe you can arrange to have high-density information signals passed between a future computer and a current one over the visual link of the crystal? Laser pulses, etc. Then you could download huge amounts of data from each potential future.

    Your effective final limitation in how much you can change the future will be how quickly you can implement the knowledge gained so as to change the range of futures being scried. Mine the future for knowledge, use it to change the future, mine the future again. All before your lifespan runs out and you can't scry into the future anymore. If you're old, recruit someone young so you can borrow their lifespan to look farther by using the crystal together.

      I didn't understand your ratcheting idea at first, but I think I do now.

      Instead of using precommitment merely to constrain the futures you scry to the ones filled with the activity you want to skip ahead of, also try to constrain those futures to ones with *additional scrying* in them, since the look-ahead advantages will compound.

          > To add to what you said, any futures that you do additional scrying in are going to be disproportionately weighted in the set of all possible futures.

          This is the part I think I disagree with and I think it's why I was confused at first. As I understand it the crystal doesn't create futures, but instead randomly selects a possible future and shows it. A timeline with scrying in it isn't automatically more likely to be selected by scrying, because all possible futures are equally likely to be selected regardless of their properties. Probabilities show up as shared properties among groups of those futures. For example "what's the probability that the sun will still shine tomorrow" is equivalent to asking what fraction of all possible tomorrows have that property. 

          If you want to only look at futures with more scrying in them you've got to attempt to eliminate some of the non-scrying futures yourself beforehand by separate means (like precommitment of some kind), and then let the crystal select randomly from that now-more-narrow future.

          Say you commit to a plan to setting aside time next week for flipping a coin once an hour for ten hours and using the crystal only if the coin comes up heads, writing down each coin flip result as you go. Then scry ahead to the completed note as many times as you like (or can fit). What distribution of results will you see?

          It's my hypothesis that you'll see a binomial distribution centered on 50% heads, rather than something skewed towards heads just because those timelines had more scrying in them.

          I think there might be something you had in mind that I'm still missing, but I haven't been able to figure it out.

    What did the version of myself that I'm viewing see in the crystal ball? The same thing I'm seeing, or a randomly selected future? I'm assuming the second because otherwise there could be paradoxes.

    Don't immediately look into the far future, or I just give whatever AGI wins a way to the present.

    I could look one hour ahead and write down what I see for 61 minutes, including the writing I saw in the ball. That way, I could aggregate information from many timelines.

    Take care to include an abort chance that is much greater than the chance of coming across information that would maliciously convince me to propagate it.

    Include a computer in the loop to acquire amounts of compute exponential in my security. This can be converted into bitcoins at the cost of attention. Looking at day-trading data lets me multiply my money but gets me even more attention.

    Precommit to a tiny chance of doing a moderately dangerous experiment to spread that information to many timelines. (If the experiment risks me getting forced to look into the far future, that is beyond moderate.)

    Generally, refer to [Humans consulting HCH](https://ai-alignment.com/humans-consulting-hch-f893f6051455) with all its ups and downs.

    It does seem pretty trivial to use this to become the richest person alive and then use your wealth to implement tech and discoveries by precommitment to having really important papers on particular topics around you at certain times.

    Given the advantages of both your market foresight and prior tech knowledge it seems likely that you can get enough money to build an artificial island and basically form a micronation with the power/resources of a full sized nation.       
    Then once you've done that you can deliberately keep certain tech secret and well contained, letting the researchers working for you have the ability to work on AGI and AI safety without real time constraints (though their future work would be brought back to the past so they'd advance extremely quickly) or competition. So pretty plausibly with this power you can ensure that if there's any chance of FAI you can develop it within at most decades (after all in terms of raw processing power we should already be able to run an efficient AGI) and give it your utility function in particular.

    Hmmm... anything that will be within two metres of me in a possible future. An interesting limit.

    So, if I wander past a room, perhaps lean on the wall, at a specific time, then a week before that time I can see what's beyond that wall. That gives me the equivalent of short-range X-ray vision with a time shift.

    And then, having seen that information, *I do not need to walk along that corridor*. (Of course, if seeing the information prevents me from walking along that corridor, then there's a chance that I see something entirely different - whatever's two metres from me in the other timeline).

    --------------

    Using this to make money on the stock market is straightforward. I simply need to sample stock prices a few weeks in advance over several futures, and pick the ones that go up in all or most futures. With a camera and a spreadsheet, this should be possible.

    On top of this, the universe may not be deterministic but some things are. I can certainly win scratchcard lotteries with my crystal ball (or at least refrain from losing at them). And then there's the matter of horse-racing - I can observe the results of a horse-racing meeting a month in advance (it's easy enough to print that out after the race and keep the paper in a pretermined place at a predetermined time), several times, and thus get a good estimate of the *real* odds of certain horses winning or losing. I can compare these odds to the odds offered for betting and with some statistics, make a reasonably consistent profit. (A race that turns up the same way in every possible future has probably been fixed in some way - it's probably a good idea to alert someone official anonymously, in advance, including a prediction of the fixed results - though not saying how I know or giving any means to get back in contact with me. When my prediction turns out to be true, an honest official would probably start a very quick investigation into the race). The same goes for betting on other sporting events.

  **Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 3: Tin**

  Ok then, week three of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For part one and a general overview of the magic system, see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/). I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

  *Spoiler note*: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

  Up this week is tin. As always I'm interested in what a tin twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

  **Allomancy**

  Allomantic tin enhances your senses. A soon as you start burning tin your eyesight, hearing and sense of smell, taste and touch all improve dramatically. How much those senses improve depends on the allomancer, but at the (very) high end this allows you to do things like see through the tiny gaps in the fabric of a blindfold or feel the grain of the wooden chair you sit on through your pants.

  It's worth noting that while your ability to process all this new information does increase, it does not increase proportionally to the amount of extra information coming in and it's very easy for an allomancer to get overwhelmed. You cannot choose which senses to enhance (it's all or nothing), so an allomancer burning tin to keep an eye out for distant enemies can easily get distracted by some footsteps two floors down or the scent of a cooking stove three buildings over. Somewhat ironically, this means people that make good tin allomancers are the kind of people capable of blocking out the world around them and focus intently on one thing.

  Another risk with tin allomancy is that you become hypersensitive to stong stimuli, so burning a lot of tin in bright sunlight might blind the allomancer and loud sounds can daze them. On the other hand, this effect can also be used to clear your head from pain or exhaustion by briefly burning a large amount of tin.

  **Feruchemy**

  Feruchemic tin also centers around enhanced senses, but unlike allomancers, feruchemists store each individual sense they posses separately. This means, for instance, storing eyesight and hearing at the same time requires two separate metalminds (jargon note: a metalmind is another word for a feruchemically charged piece of metal).

  While storing it, that particular sense is numbed; storing eyesight makes your vision go blurry, hearing makes sounds become faded and muffled, taste makes all foods become bland and so on. When tapping a tin metalmind the sense stored in that metalmind becomes vastly more acute. 

  Another area in which feruchemic tin differs from allomantic tin is in how it enhances your senses. Where allomancy just greatly enhances the amount of raw data coming in, feruchemy makes you more capable of discerning tiny differences in input. This manifests slightly differently for each sense:

  For sight, it means the feruchemist is able to 'zoom in' on distant things. This works similarly to binoculars or telescopes in that you sacrifice field of view for a greater ability to discern details on distant objects.

  Tapping hearing makes a feruchemist able to pick out individual components of the sounds they are hearing, allowing them to, for instance, follow a conversation taking place on the other side of a busy room or picking out the one badly tuned instrument in an orchestra.

  Similarly, tapping taste or smell allows a feruchemist to discern specific tastes or scents even when they are covered up by many others, they do not become more able to pick up faint scents/tastes, that's allomantic tin's thing, so in practice this is of limited use (though keep in mind that we _are_ twinborn in this particular scenario).

  Touch works somewhat differently. As far as this magic system is concerned, touch is actually three separate senses that each have to be stored in separate metalminds: somatosensation (pressure), nociception (pain) and thermoception (temperature). For each of these, feruchemy allow you to very precisely locate where each sensation is coming from. For instance, a tin feruchemist tapping somatosensation can place a finger on a coin and, without looking at it, describe the relief stamped into its surface, a feruchemist tapping nociception is able to specifically diagnose which of their bones are broken after a fight and a feruchemist tapping thermoception could find nearby sources of heat by tracking which parts of their body are warmer than the others.

  Of course, humans have much more than five senses and a feruchemist is able to store each of them. How useful this is might be questionable, but if you can find a path to godhood that involves knowing very precisely how full your bladder is, then by all means let us know about it.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    So are tin feruchemists effectively immune to pain as long as they have tin they can store their sense of pain in? That's useful as a cheap kind of anesthetic for medical surgeries, though not so good for dealing with torture since any torturer would just remove your tin before commencing. 

    > Of course, humans have much more than five senses and a feruchemist is able to store each of them. How useful this is might be questionable, but if you can find a path to godhood that involves knowing very precisely how full your bladder is, then by all means let us know about it. 

    What other senses are there? 

    * Can you turn off your sense of hunger and thus make going on diets easy? 
    * Can you turn off your sense of fatigue and thus physically push yourself beyond your limits?
    * Can you turn off your sense of danger and thus commit acts of heroic bravery?
    * Can you turn off your sense of guilt and thus commit unspeakable horrors (when necessary)?
    * Can you turn off your sense of disgust/revulsion and thus wade through filth and gore if needed?
    * Can you store your artistic senses for a long period and then unleash them to be a super art critic?
    * Can you store senses on the level of proteins and enzymes? For example, could you make your brain extra sensitive to dopamine to make yourself happier? Can you make your white blood cells extra sensitive to bacteria, or make them less sensitive to alleviate autoimmune diseases?
    ```

      ```
      > Can you turn off your sense of hunger and thus make going on diets easy?

      > Can you turn off your sense of fatigue and thus physically push yourself beyond your limits?

      Those should probably would work, yeah. I especially like the second one, you probably wouldn't be able get rid of all the effects of physical exertion and I doub't it'll be very pleasant, but I imagine you be able to go a lot further than you otherwise would if your brain is just not getting the feedback from your muscles that something is wrong.

      >   Can you store senses on the level of proteins and enzymes? For example, could you make your brain extra sensitive to dopamine to make yourself happier?


      I imagine these are more emotions than senses, there is another metal that numbs emotions and it explicitly affects bravery and happiness.

      Ok, now your pushing it :)

    ```
    And that is the third edition in this miniseries. I must confess I've always been especially fond of allomantic/feruchemic tin, it's just such an incredibly varied powerset and it really speaks to the imagination without being over the top powerful.

    For this entry, I have take significant liberties expanding on what we've seen in the books in order to make it concrete enough to do some actual munchkinry on it. I do not believe anything I've said directly contradicts canon, but I am speculating a lot on how each sense works when enhanced with feruchemy.

    My current plan is to do this for future entries as well, especially once we get to the more esoteric metals, but I'd like to hear what you all think of that. Do you prefer I stick to what we know is the case in canon and accept that some metals just aren't going to be very munchkinable or is it better to extrapolate (read: wildly speculate) on canon in order to get a more concretely defined powerset?
    ```

    - u/bacontime:
      ```
      I like the extrapolation. None of what you've posted seems out of place with canon.

      I'm curious which parts are extrapolated here, and which are confirmed by Brando Sando? I know the fact that tapping sight lets you "zoom in" is canon, but I'm guessing  the decomposition of touch is something you surmised.
      ```

  - u/bacontime:
    ```
    Hrm. If allomantic tin can increases the amount of info coming in, and feruchemy lets you better focus on the info you're getting (and so mitigate the danger of flaring tin in a bright or noisy environment). Combining the two should let you some pretty crazy things.  

    * Sit in a crowd, and track a specific individual's movement via hearing. Or similarly track people through walls.
    * Full echolocation might be possible, with allomancy letting you hear faint echoes, and feruchemy letting you focus on and interpret the echoes.
    * Do that 'listening to someone's heartbeat to tell if they are nervous' thing that Daredevil likes so much.
    * Track down people like a bloodhound. 
    * If tin allomancy lets you see things that aren't actual quite visible, I wonder if you smell things that can't actually quite be smelled. Like odourless gasses. 
    * Possibly look at the stars during daytime. Allomancy lets you see through the fog of the atmosphere. Feruchemy lets you not get blinded?

    ------------------------------------------------

    The other interesting potential source of munchkinry I see is with expanding your sensorium.

     I recall that Sanderson confirmed that a hypothetical platypus feruchemist could store electroreception in tin. If we rule out stealing that sense with hemalurgy (because stapling a platypus soul to your own is probs not healthy), it might be possible to hack your way into the sense using body modification.

    Some people [implant](https://www.medicalbag.com/body-modification/magnet-implants/article/472457/) small neodymium magnets into their fingertip so that they can sense magnetic fields. If you do this and play around with the implant long enough for your brain to adapt, then it might become a part of your spiritweb. (We know that the in the Cosmere, your soul's residual image can change over time, so that magical healing won't remove scars or other injuries which are part of your self-conception.)

    Then once your brain is adapted to interpreting this very weak new sense, it might be possible to compound it up to the point of usefulness.
    ```

    - u/Silver_Swift:
      ```
      I had a section on the feruchemist platypus in there originally, but I cut it partially for length and partially because I couldn't come up with a plausible way for people to gain new senses with either contemporary or Scadrial level technology without having to explain yet another magic system. 

      > Some people implant small neodymium magnets into their fingertip so that they can sense magnetic fields. If you do this and play around with the implant long enough for your brain to adapt, then it might become a part of your spiritweb.

      Oh, that is very cool! I'm a little sceptical on this giving you an actual additional sense, I suspect these people just feel the magnet move around inside their fingers slightly, but that should still work for us.
      ```

      - u/bacontime:
        ```
        > I'm a little sceptical on this giving you an actual additional sense, I suspect these people just feel the magnet move around inside their fingers slightly

        On a physical level, the magnet is absolutely just stimulating touch receptors. But some of the people with the implant report learning to intuitively interpret the sensation as feeling em fields. I would guess that it's similar to the mental phenomenon that occurs when an adult receives a cochlear implant.

        The question here is whether that self-conception of the sensation is enough to alter the spiritweb. 

        For feruchemy, I guess it doesn't really matter whether you sense the fields via your touch-tinmind or via a separate electroreception-tinmind. But for allomancy, which magically provides extra info, it might matter. If it enhances the implant-sense by amplifying the feeling of vibrating metal, then boosting the sense might just make your finger feel shaky. Whereas if it interfaces with your intuitive interpretation of em field strength, then the magic might actually give a more detailed map of the local fields.

    >allomancer burning tin to keep an eye out for distant enemies

    and

    >For sight, it means the feruchemist is able to 'zoom in' on distant things.

    This potentially breaks physics. Electromagnetic radiation has a property called [conservation of étendue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue), which is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Lenses, and the path photons take through space, have to be time reversible - this is why you can't [set a fire from moonlight](https://what-if.xkcd.com/145/). If your eye is able to pull out more information from a source despite your cornea having the same refractive index, then you have free energy due to more photons hitting your optic nerve than have left the object via black body radiation. With massively invasive eye surgery, give someone massive "eyes" which are actually just lenses pointed at a solar panel, and then have them constantly use tin. Free power.

    Not entirely sure all the consequences of photons no longer being time invariant, but I think it'd be pretty bad. I saw some thought experiment for using vampires being unable to be viewed in mirrors to do time travel, but not sure if that's applicable - it was something like due to photon time symmetry you can detect if a photon will be emitted and hit a vampire off a mirror in the future, even if the vampire is outside your light cone, but if you're already breaking photon time symmetry that probably doesn't hold. There's also something in there about U(1) gauge symmetry.

    (If tin only increases your *sensitivity* then there's a hard limit on how far you can see, since your optic nerve being able to identify single photons doesn't help if you don't have enough rods and cones in the first place, and you'd start running into problems with light inference if it fixed that too.)

    Seeing through the threads in a blindfold should also be impossible: You can't see through a blindfold because light is being reflected by the fabric, and light has to be able to *hit* your eye for you to be able to see. I'm not sure why anyone in-universe wouldn't just use thicker bandages if they know x% of the population is able to see through them. [This](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/s0257-8972(01)01055-6) says that the average distance between cotton threads in a light woven pattern is 100 microns - which is half the average wavelength of visible light - and that's not including the other layer of threads interlacing with it. I'm not sure *any* rational school of magic would let you see a full picture through that sort of mesh without breaking physics.

    >Tapping hearing makes a feruchemist able to pick out individual components of the sounds they are hearing

    Hearing anything is based off a Fourier transformation, which is done via tiny hairs in the ear that activate based off different resonant frequencies of sound. For magic to be able to give you a higher range of frequencies, it'd have to stimulate your cochlear nerve directly, since you don't have a physical means of picking up only those new frequencies. Hearing lose in the elderly or by going to too many rock concerts is mediated by damage to those hairs, so using tin should give you your entire hearing range back - even if you're deaf, in fact, since it's the same mechanism Cochlear implants use (direct nerve stimulation).

    "Follow a conversation taking place on the other side of a busy room" is a bit weird, since in most cases that's physically impossible - the sound layers up with constructive and destructive interference, so by the time the sound reaches your ears there's no method of recovery no matter how precise your ears are. Depending on how tin magic does this, it might be breaking information theory entropy bounds: Fast Fourier transform is O(n log n) time, which has been the bane of a few "infinite compression breakthroughs" or solving NP problems. If magic is able to give you the FFT of a signal in O(1) time with infinite precision, then you could factor RSA public keys since the main speedup in Shor's algorithm is due to the quantum Fourier transformation of time O(log log n). (I think not really, because you can't physically represent an RSA public key within the universe and would still need O(n log n) inverse Fourier transform to sample from the nerve signals, but it's the thought that counts).

  One day you're eating a hamburger, and it's not very good. You remember a hamburger you had during your 10th birthday party, and fondly recall it being delicious. You say out loud "I wish I could eat that burger again". Unbeknownst to you, you'd rubbed against a magic lamp the night before and a jinn had been listening to you and waiting for you to say the magic words. *poof* Suddenly you find yourself transported back in time, and find yourself holding the mouth-watering hamburger from your memory in your hands. What do you do?

  To clarify how it works a bit more:

  You get no other wishes. The jinn wasn't one of the 'three piece' ones like in the movies. 

  You can stay in the past only as long as the hamburger remains edible in normal hamburger fashion. That means if it goes rotten, you go to the future. If you finish it except for crumbs, you go back to the future. If you *freeze* the hamburger - the moment the burger ceases being 'edible in the normal hamburger fashion' you go back to the future. 

  You retain all your knowledge and intelligence, but your body is 10-year-old-you's body. 

  The Jinn is friendly but not infinitely patient. He'll tolerate a little rules lawyering about the wish, but his beneficence is not infinite so beware.
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    The best way to extend your time in the past is probably to try a [ship of theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) thing, where you keep replacing parts of the hamburger so it never goes rotten. You can eat the replaced parts as well, to justify to the jinn that you are eating the burger.

    The next problem is that if you change the past, what happens to present you? The 10 year old you is still a kid and very susceptible to changes in his environment. If you do anything major like tell your parents ways to get filthy rich, that could have significant effects on your upbringing, which butterfly to the future where your entire personality and lifestyle may be reshaped arbitrarily. You could go from the current rational you to a rich spoiled brat who thinks people only exist to serve him. So unless you are willing to risk killing own your personality, you should make changes secretly.

    If you have a computer that you will keep for many years, you can try writing a program that automatically activates when you are 20 and tells you how to munchkin your future knowledge then, instead of when you are a susceptible 10 year old.

    You can also help out strangers that you like by sending them anonymous letters containing your future knowledge. Send celebrities who died in accidents anonymous letters telling them to avoid these accidents. Send anonymous letters containing a list of all future hurricanes you remember to the people in charge of the cities that will be hit by said hurricanes. Advance the state of science by sending future scientific knowledge to current day scientists via anonymous letters.

    I assume this lets you change the past, but only about 2 weeks of it before your refeigerated hamburger becomes unsafe to eat. There are better ways you could preserve it, like putting it in a jar, bombarding both it and the jar with gamma rays, and then remotely sealing the jar before putting it into a refrigerator kept at just above freezing, but a 10yo couldn't get access to that equipment unless their parents worked in a lab. Some kind of UV sterilization might help, but that won't protect it from anything inside the bun. I'm assuming there's lettuce and tomato on the hamburger, so flash-heating it might damage the integrity of the burger too much. Better safe than sorry, and again, you can't access this stuff as a 10yo.

    Let's assume you can preserve the burger for 3 weeks with the stuff you have on-hand. What can a 10yo do to improve the lot of humanity? If you've memorized loads of sports stats for some reason, you might be able to convince your parents to make a small bet on long odds, which would provide them with more freedom and hopefully improve your future situation somewhat. This would also get your parents to trust you on more problematic future information. Preventing 9/11 is likely impossible because it would be really hard to get the relevant authorities to trust you in 3 weeks, and I'm unconvinced that is the best use of your time. Having your parents take you to a major pharmaceutical company and tell their researchers about modern advancements might help, especially if you can provide them with answers to  easy-to-test, difficult-to-guess questions which have been solved in the present day.

    The reason I'm not saying "invest in Google lul" is because only some 10yos will have existed at exactly the right time to convince their parents to do so. I'm young enough that I might be able to get my parents interested in Apple stock at the right time, but I'm still a few years early to do it perfectly. There might not be too many butterflies to change their success, but I couldn't guarantee it.

    Unfortunately, a huge amount of your success on this issue is going to be tied to how much your parents trust you, and how large the leaps they will take on their child's advice. Having only 3 weeks is pretty brutal.

    ...I'm suddenly surrounded by a bunch of ten-year-olds and party food. If I put my hamburger down it will get eaten one way or another. So... I've got maybe ten, fifteen minutes in the past, with no warning, no prep time, and nothing more than the raw contents of my brain? I don't think I can manage much better than a brief 'note to self'. Something like "Invest in Google" sounds like a good idea, but I think a better idea is "On 9 December 2018, early in the morning, pick a better wish" could be more effective...

  # Bargain superpower optimisation!

  You have the power to:

  1. Quickly and easily create convincing fake identities for any online community
  2. Rapidly accrue status and respect within each identity's respective community, becoming someone the other members pay attention to

  This does not give you any special ability to:

  * Supernaturally manipulate others
  * Enter private communities uninvited
  * Create fake information not related to maintaining your identity

  You may be able to use your status to browbeat others, fish for invitations, or trick people into helping with a forgery, but you won't have any advantages in doing these over someone who earned their status.

  Other than farming internet points, how can you do the most good with this ability?

  Ideas I've had so far:

  * Shift the Overton Window of politically influential subgroups
  * Draw people's attention to information without having to go through the usual crowded channels (I'm thinking of that treatment mentioned in Inadequate Equilibria)
  * Infiltrate extremist or criminal groups and leak information to the authorities

    Put a Patreon link on your blog(s) and make a modest amount of money.

    Your fake identities have to have lives outside of the Internet. Details about  those lives are convincing to people, including people who live similar lives (same jobs, same hometown, etc.). Depending on how much you post, this may be a way to access information you wouldn't otherwise have about places, job fields, people, and so on.

    Is it possible to make people think you know them IRL? Obviously this wouldn't be a good idea, as they might become suspicious as to why you never come to meetups.
