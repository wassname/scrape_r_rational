  I thought it was pretty great how divine power comes from something *other than belief* in this story. Very UNSONG-esque reasoning there.

  >“There are,” said Hermes, “certain games mortals play, in which a necessary prerequisite is to create your own hero character. And in some of those games, you get a certain amount of points, which you are allowed to allocate either to intelligence or to strength, so that the smarter you are, the weaker you must be, and vice versa. And I notice, Heracles, that you are the strongest man who has ever existed. Do you know what that implies?”

  >“It implies that I’m very strong,” said Heracles. “But also, I was wondering – are we there yet?”

    it's an amusing burn, but also bruises my delicate ego a little. I recall there being a bit much *swoleshaming* in that pill cyoa thing from this author, too. The degree to which life is video-game-y like this is certainly an empirical question, but generally the more systematically investigated fitness/strength and intelligence* associations *I've* seen have been quite positive (plenty confounded by e.g. health and nutrition, however, I'm sure). 

    That's consistent with my own experiences, too (the heavy lifters at the gym are generally well above average in smarts; then again, I've only a) worked out at university/hospital gyms, so most everyone there has or is getting some advanced degree, and b) nobody there would really qualify as an "elite" lifter or athlete, e.g. >450 Wilks). I imagine it levels off at the extremes, though (Mariusz Pudzianowski and Brian Shaw perhaps possessing no special genius). D'y'all reckon it'd dip back down (perhaps a function of how much time you have to devote to improving yourself in various respects -- after a few hours a week it cuts in to your learning?)?

    It's not a literature I'm too familiar with; anyone here know it better?

    *and charisma, constitution, dexterity, etc...

      In the pill thing, the red pill guy literally saves the universe. Black and Orange and Pink are all helpless... after all, the only thing that matters in life is BRUTE STRENGTH.

      Well, I think that there is some truth to that stereotype. But it's not a stereotype about body-builders and the like, that stereotype is very different, and includes being a fussy eater. It's a stereotype about people who abuse steroids.

      Picture one of the heavy lifters at your gym. Now picture your stereotypical steroid abuser.

      Which one is Ares? Which one is red pill guy? I don't think that Ares is any weaker than Hercules, it's just not his sole defining characteristic.

      Also I read "It implies that I’m very strong" as being very sarcastic, especially with that follow up.

        I think *abuse* is carrying a bit of the weight here (har har), insofar as it can be distinguished from "perform a reasoned analysis of the costs, risks, and benefits of hormonal supplementation and proceed accordingly". *Abusing* something is clearly a hallmark of thoughtlessness, but undergoing, say, TRT in old age could be quite thoughtful (or if you find it really, really fun, or can make a lot of money by dialing in your body composition a certain way, like with most action movie stars). As for imagining the typical IFBB (or IPF, etc.) pro, my impression is that they're generally well-adjusted but very dedicated to their job/sport, at least from videos I've seen (again, having never met anyone at the "elite" level). 

        > Also I read "It implies that I’m very strong" as being very sarcastic, especially with that follow up.

        I thought so too from the quote (it's a solid retort -- "I note your story and affirm no further implication"), but their characterizations in the rest of the story put me more in mind of [this](https://i.imgur.com/fGMj0Be.png).

          Yeah, I posted that quote before I finished it. I think it's probably a point that should be brought up with Scott at some point.

          There are some things that mitigate it, but on the whole I don't disagree. It's a cheap joke.

  Cf. [*American Gods* and its sequel](https://www.goodreads.com/series/114135).

  - u/LazarusRises:
    ```
    I still don't understand why there wasn't a single reference to the Greek or Roman pantheon in American Gods. Haven't read Anansi Boys, but it seems like a glaring hole.
    ```

    - u/Fredlage:
      ```
      I think Gaiman's reasoning was that the Gods had to come along with people who believed in them. I vaguely remember reading somewhere that he looked for any remote historical records suggesting that this or that civilization had come to America in the distant past. Probably couldn't find any for the greek.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        Oh right, that's fair. I guess my mind went "but there are totally Greeks in America" without thinking about it at all.
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      There was, actually. There's a single one-off joke where someone mistakes *Media* for *Medea*.

      And that's it, I think.

      No idea why I remembered that, it's been years since I read it.
      ```

      - u/LazarusRises:
        ```
        So weird. He could have done so much with it. Maybe he thought the territory was too well-trodden, but still.
        ```

- u/PatsoRedneb:
  ```
  It has a very similar feeling to [this short story based on a meme](https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/06/02/and-i-show-you-how-deep-the-rabbit-hole-goes/), which is good, because I loved it as well. Then again, it's the only other fiction by Scott that I've read, so maybe it's just his style.
  ```

  - u/darkardengeno:
    ```
    It is definitely his style and if you like it you should check out [UNSONG](https://unsongbook.com/prologue-2/), which is like this, but longer (and also bible puns. many, many bible puns).
