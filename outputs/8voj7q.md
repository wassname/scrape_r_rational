    I edited the quoted links to go to the mobile site, so I can click on them in RiF, since I prefer that over regular browsers for reading.

      Oh, I didn't even realize that FF.net didn't auto-redirect to mobile. I'll make sure to include the mobile links for the next chapter.

  It only took three-ish months and about five different rewrites, but Chapter 4 is finally done. Hopefully my work on Orders of Magnitude gives credibility when I say that I have the full story written out in my head, and it will be finished within the year. 

  Oh, by the way, spoiler alert: Twilight Sparkle dies.

  So glad to see this back!

  >[You know it better as](#s "Atlantis")

  Mind blown.  You've taken on yourself a hard task here, but it does fit a realm where magic is so intricately knit into the world - and it also would go far toward explaining the similarities between Equestrian and Earth culture.

  Well done; I'm eagerly awaiting more!

  - u/NanashiSaito:

    Thanks, I'm glad you're enjoying it. The spoiler you're referencing was the original seed of this entire story, so you can definitely expect to see that more fully fleshed out.

  Hold on a wand flipping moment, HPMOR is getting a continuation from eliezer?

  edit: clicked on link and profile, more confused now.
  ```

  - u/NanashiSaito:
    ```
    Nope, not Eliezer, just a random meta-fanfiction author. 

    As hilarious as it would be if EY declared this as the canon sequel to HPMOR, it's definitely more of an AU than it is a sequle.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  OK, this just became very good. I love how you tied two settings together, and am feeling inspired by it.

  Dumbledore felt a bit ooc in this chapter. It felt kind of forced. The limitation on the philosopher's stone felt like it was pulled out of thin air. If the philosopher's stone embodies all of transfiguration then there is no good reason for it to be limited to less than a few hundred transformations per day. It would make more sense if all transfigurations everywhere drew from the power of the stone, and whatever unused power is leftover would be from worlds with a very small or inefficient population of magic users. The available power should vary depending on how much magic is being used for transfiguration at any given time. And that should still leave a hell of a lot of power left. More than enough to grant immortality to everyone on Earth including muggles. 

  The explanation of "the stone is a threat to statute of secrecy" is good enough. Why not just go with that and leave out all the extra unnecessary stuff? Instead of constructing this unbelievably complicated hypothetical dystopian future in order to justify an unrealistically fair and just status quo. Also, your portraying someone like Dumbledore in this way doesn't make sense at all. It's flat out denying the cultural divide between wizards and muggles and between Harry and Dumbledore which was brought up in "Pretending to be Wise part 2". In doing so you've also eliminated at least a couple of Dumbledore's main character flaws/blind spots.

  Your explanation should basically just boil down to "a muggleborn will break statute of secrecy by revealing the stone 's existence to muggles => a muggleborn will try to transfigure a bunch of subatomic particles. The end."

  Combined with the existence of an afterlife in this story, the stakes are much lower than they were in the original HPMOR. it's much harder to care as much about whether Hermione is brought back to life or not because she's STILL ALIVE and has been this entire time, just transported to an an alternate plane of existence.

  Sorry, but this story reads a LOT like pro-death apologism and social modesty trying to masquerade as transhumanism and rationality.

  Your writing is good quality, but I think you might be trying to appeal to the wrong audience.

    It's a fair point about Dumbledore's characterization. I felt like the HPMOR-version of Dumbledore was played a bit too clueless for my liking, so in this universe, he's more savvy than Harry initially gives him credit for.  

    Also a fair criticism re: the lower stakes. Part of that was by necessity: there was suspense in the original HPMOR because you weren't actually sure if Harry would be able to bring back Hermione. But the canon ending explicitly introduces an afterlife into the universe. So any continuation/AU-fic either has to do some pretty serious ret-conning, or has to work within those limitations.

    From a literary perspective, I'm hoping to build suspense via HOW Hermione gets resurrected, rather than WHETHER she gets resurrected. Whether I'll succeed at that, well, that's up to you as the reader.

    That said, I did want to address two minor points directly:

    1. The limitation of the Stone was taken directly from the ending of HPMOR.
    2. If you do happen to stick around and read the work in its entirety, hopefully it will convince you that it is quite decidedly NOT pro-death.
    ```

    - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
      ```
      Okay so maybe I'm just getting a bit confused about the math involved here. I thought the limitation in canon HPMOR was higher because Harry explicitly states that it could be used for all muggles too as well as all sentient magical creatures. The canon reason he doesn't do this is not because the stone isn't capable of it, it's because it would require breaking the statute of secrecy, and then some muggleborn tries to transfigure subatomic particles and destroys the universe.

      Also, Dumbledore wasn't unrealistically clueless, he had very particular realistic blindspots due to his upbringing. There are many MANY instances in real life of geniuses as brilliant as Dumbledore making exactly that kind of moronic mistake in reasoning, especially outside their area of expertise.

      Canon HPMOR DID NOT have an afterlife. What are you talking about?
      ```

      - u/NanashiSaito:
        ```
        Double checking the math real quick... In Ch 119 it says, "*Experiment had showed that the Stone made one Transfiguration permanent every three minutes and fifty-four seconds*". 3 minutes, 54 seconds = One use of the stone per 234 seconds. One day = 86,400 seconds. 86,000 / 234 ~= 367 uses of the stone per day.
        ```

      - u/NanashiSaito:
        ```
        I agree that Dumbledore wasn't *unrealistically* clueless. The cluelessness perfectly fit his characterization in HPMOR. With this story, I'm trying to explore a much darker side of Dumbledore, the side of Dumbledore who almost took over the world with Grindelwald for the "greater good", which has necessitated reframing some of Dumbledore's flaws from the original canon. Rather than being blissfully ignorant, he's painfully aware but chooses to act otherwise. 

        As for an afterlife in the original canon, maybe that's not the best word for it. But Hermione died, then she came back to life. Part of what I'm aiming to do with this story is provide a concrete mechanism for that resurrection. 

        Hopefully I'll achieve those aims, but I'll let you be the judge of that!

  Having just read the first chapter of this, I should probably ask, how much SD canon are you drawing on? I've read it far enough to recognise the quote about _Tír inna n-Óc_, but far from all of it, so I'm wary of spoilers.
  ```

  - u/NanashiSaito:
    ```
    None. There are a few tips of the hat here and there, but nothing that is remotely spoilery.
    ```

- u/Meriipu:

  So it has been nagging me a bit.

  Was there a connection between the fault not being in the stars, and the machines making a "boom clap" noise (of all possible noises to make) shortly after?

  In any case well done
  ```

  - u/NanashiSaito:
    ```
    Oh but of course! Well spotted!

    https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AOPMlIIg_38

    For those who don't get the reference, the song Boom Clap was featured in the movie "The Fault in our Stars". One of the lyrics, among others, goes "Boom, clap, the sound of my heart, the beat goes on and on and on and on"

    Dumbledore says, "After all, the fault, dear Harry, it's not with our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings." This is a paraphrase of a famous quote from Julius Caesar where one character is bemoaning their fate, and another chastises him, basically saying, "The problem isn't with fate, it's that you're letting other people rule your life for you." Dumbledore is gently chastising Harry in the same way.

    This oft-quoted passage about "the fault in our stars" served as the namesake of the movie with the same name. Immediately after, the machines in Dumbledore's office go "Boom. Clap." Then "Thump-bump. Thump-bump. Thump-bump", the sound of a heartbeat. Then "Beat. Beat. Beat," which is the beat going on and on and on and on.
    ```
