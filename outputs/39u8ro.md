## I dreamed of a magic plot token, what do you do with it?

### Post:

So, in my dream I had a golden ring, about the size of a finger ring, that when you put anything through it it vanished. The other side was always dark, except occasionally in the dark you could see flickers of light. Vary occasionally there are sounds and muffled voices.

Part way through my dream which was otherwise about as logical as dreams usually are, I realized that it was a two way portal to [a cave on Easter Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Island#Caves) several hundred years ago. The other end presented as a similar ring, and was located in the cave, and someone at the other end was using it as a source of light and air while hiding out in it. Of course things went weird and irrational again after that, but I remember that detail.

It seems like this is the kind of magic plot device that could become world changing if (im)properly abused. How to communicate with the people at the other end? Sound doesn't travel very well, and nobody understands the written language of the Easter Islanders.

[Edit: sound is muffled, and so is light, but you can push objects through and they arrive intact and apparently undamaged... the forward-time protagonist has received pieces of litter probably including bits of vegetable matter that are still alive]

[Edit: to make it clear, there is a multi-hundred-year time gap between this end of the portal and the other.]

  I don't know anything about it besides what I heard in my spanish III class, but Easter Island (Rapa Nui) is part of Chile, and it is inhabited by the Chilean descendents of Easter Island natives, and maybe some other immigrants from the main land.

  This could make a good story.
  Maybe the person who's trapped in the cave is either from the distant past, or he's a modern chilean/easter islander archaelogist that got trapped in a cave in while studying his ancestors or something. Although then I'm not sure how the protagonist (you) even finds out he's from Rapa Nui if you can't see where he is through the ring and if you can't understand spanish or whatever native language he's speaking. If light is coming out of your side of the ring, and you can see him through it, then he should also be able to see you.

    The other end of the hole is separated by a multi-hundred year time gap from the present. It's not in Easter Island today, it's in Easter Island at the time when people there were using Rongorongo.

    Figuring this out would of course be part of the story. Possibly by attempting to communicate by pushing coiled pieces of paper through?

      Modern archaeologist gets trapped in the past before the cave they were exploring was opened up by modern drilling techniques, and their wedding ring and that of their spouse become linked wormholes?

      (Both lose a finger in the process, so the archaeologist is slowly dying from blood loss over the course of the story.)

  Push food through, water, whatever the other person needs. 

  Contact government officials, have them take over.

  They can start pushing a robot through and small electrical components and some electrical equipment, and train the person on the other end to assemble it with food, water, and video guides. 

  Once you have a robot on the other side use that robot to build other robots. 

  Repeat, have fun.

    Will the government really want to engage in global causality violation? Do you really want to let them?

      It seems like the only really effective way to stop global warming. I think it's worth it.

    They could assemble the robot themselves, ship in a bottle-style.

  Are electrical signals muffled? If not, you could just stick an earphone through, establish a protocol, then use it and a stuck-through headset mic to communicate. If yes, you'll have to find someone who'll make you a thin mp3 player on a string etc.

  Several hundred years ago?

  If that is a very long time prior to Easter Sunday in 1722, you might be able to start working to educate the Easter Islanders with the scientific method before the Europeans arrive?  Working slowly of course, passing rolled papers through, and receiving them in return.

  Since you exist, you clearly aren't interfering with your own timeline, but you have a connection to that other timeline/dimension.

  The first thing to do is determine the state of the people on the island.  If it's early Easter Island, it's a pretty ideal place for people with plenty of trees and other resources.  Trees are important.  If they have already chopped down all their trees, you need to start sending them seeds and teaching them about forestry so they can maintain that resource.

  If they still have trees, you need to teach them conservation and forestry so they don't run into the same problem in that timeline as they did in ours.

  Educate them through the ring.  Create an erudite society.  Teach them what you can, and hope they are willing to learn.  As they develop, you can teach them where easily accessed natural resources are located in the world, like the Comstock lode, and they will likely happily share wealth with you.

  If you plan to make this a story, you need an opponent.  Perhaps every now and then, someone shoots an arrow through the ring.  Perhaps the ring is thrown into a fire, and you have to quickly find water to pour through the ring to put out the fire before the ring melts.

    Maybe. I don't know how long ago it was. In my dream it was only the cave (and a bunch of stuff about blue and green stones which I'm sure was my dream mixing up Stonehenge with the moai).

    > Since you exist, you clearly aren't interfering with your own timeline, but you have a connection to that other timeline/dimension.

    Yep.

    > you might be able to start working to educate the Easter Islanders with the scientific method before the Europeans arrive?

    You're only going to be able to teach them for about fifty years, and they don't have a whole lot of portable wealth they can shove back through the ring.

    > If you plan to make this a story, you need an opponent.

    Time?
