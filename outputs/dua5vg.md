## [Spoilers] Practical Guide to Evil Doubts- Villainous Interlude Cadenza

### Post:

I have some doubts pertaining to the chapter Villainous Interlude Cadenza.

I need answers for the following 

1. Detail explanation of the ritual to kill Captain. I did not understand the relation between the height of the location of kills  and the actual spell itself. 

2. Who casted the ritual? Bard? Procer? 

3. What was Tyrant's involvement in this? Only the taunt? 

4. Did Assassin kill the mages casting the ritual? 

5. What was the motive behind killing Captain at this particular juncture of the story?

### Comments:

- u/TrajectoryAgreement:
  ```
  1: Magical reasons that aren't really explained. The spell somehow relates to/utilizes the surrounding topography, which is why the height matters.

  2 and 3: The ritual was by Helikean mages, i.e. the Tyrant ordered a bunch of mages to do it.

  4: Yes.

  5. Read and find out.
  ```
