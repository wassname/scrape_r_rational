## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  I'd like to munchkin the Mongolian army from *Return of the Condor Heroes* by Jin Yong. You are Kublai Khan and you are tasked to conquer the city of Xiangyang from Song Dynasty within a little more than a month.

  There are two noteworthy techniques available to you:

  The first one is a throwing technique where a projectile is thrown then caught up to and thrown in another direction where its kinetic energy increases by simple addition instead of obeying conservation of momentum. Energy is conserved in any application of such techniques. Eg character A throws a 2 kg rock north at 3 m/s then catches up to it and throws it west at 4 m/s. The rock flies west instead of northwest(ish) at 5 m/s. Only one person in your army knows this technique at first and it takes a week to teach your army.

  The other is the ability to share ki by skin contact. Ki(just call it that for the sake of simplicity) enhances the strength, blunt force durability, speed and stamina of the body. A different person knows this technique and it takes another week to teach your army this. Your army has no ki at first and it takes a month to have enough ki to become them all into elite mooks.

  Your side has one 'hero' unit who knows the second technique and three 'ace' units, one of whom knows the first technique. You also have an army numbering several hundred thousand. The Song Dynasty side has 5 'hero' units and 1 'ace' units, and around 500 elite mooks, in addition to less than 100k garrison. 'Hero' units are 3 times as powerful as 'ace' units. Elite mooks are 10 times as powerful as normal armies. Elite mooks are negligible compared to 'ace' and 'hero' units.

  How would you take the city?

    Can two people throw a projectile back and forth to build up speed and then release it as artillery?
    ```

    - u/RetardedWabbit:

      I don't think this would be useful compared to the siege weapons of the time (catapults, ballistas, and trebuchets), since you're limited by human ability to catch and throw the projectile, so you can't use too heavy of a projectile or get too high of a velocity.

      (Edited to remove momentum addition error.)
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        Hm, I wonder what counts as a catch and a throw?

        If you're forced to "catch" a projectile head on that certainly limits the maximum amount of kinetic energy in the projectile. But what if you catch it from behind?

        Suppose the projectile is really really heavy, so that each "throw" (really a push) only adds a tiny amount of velocity. Then you could easily run up to the projectile from behind and give it yet another push forward.

        If you have a lot of people in your army learn this technique, could they create a large and super heavy metal shield (shaped sort of like a battering ram), and collectively throw it forward while charging though the enemy?
        ```

        - u/siuwa:
          ```
          And thus born the wuxia equivalent of the peasant railgun?

          Actually to think of it, since the rails are still limited by their ability to push the object, wouldn't the first idea with back-and-forth throwing be better?
          ```

      - u/Gurkenglas:
        ```
        As far as I see, forcing conservation of energy and what direction the projectile flies off into uniquely determines what happens. I think you think the forces add up because the example changed the flight direction by exactly 90 degrees.
        ```

        - u/siuwa:
          ```
          I think that you have the correct interpretation of the ability. Each 'throw' changes the direction of the projectile and adds more KE to the projectile.

          r/ShiranaiWakaranai I am pretty sure that works, at least pushing and throwing works by the source material.
          ```

        - u/RetardedWabbit:
          ```
          Yep, I misunderstood. I looked at the numbers and pattern matched 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2, not seeing that it's 5 m/s West NOT Northwest.
          ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    10 mooks = 1 Elite mook = 0 aces so only aces and above truly matter?

    1 Hero = 3 aces 

    Assuming ki is the difference between tiers: you teach your army ki and ki sharing then use these to convert as many as possible to aces or heros if ki cost 3 aces > ki cost 1 hero.

    Although the 5 hero garrison should be periodically sending out 3 heroes to raid/obliterate your forces as they approach. There are also huge strategic implications when the strongest forces are also the fastest.
    ```

    - u/siuwa:
      ```
      Kind of, but note that ki gives no piercing durability so heroes and aces can't just trivially charge into a wall of pikes or cross a hail of arrows. Also they will eventually run out of stamina.

      Ki sharing needs skin contact to be maintained so they will have to move in a formation to achieve that, and then it is only at one point of the formation.
      ```

  - u/M3mentoMori:
    ```
    It depends on how heroes/aces manage elite mooks, and where they're located. One on one, they demolish elites, yes, but what if there's ten? A hundred? A thousand? If a hero can take on any number of non-ace, non-hero units, then you've lost. The heroes will bulldoze through your armies and kill you.

    If they can be taken out by armies of elites, it depends on the number. Needing 1 million elites has the same result as above, as does any number above half your forces.

    At half or less, you can win by teaching your army ki-sharing and building them up to Elite. Then, you send 50k at the garrison (5x effective power of the garrison), and engage the heroes.
    ```

  - u/CCC_037:
    ```
    - Bait one of heroes out of city in some way. Try to ensure that he comes alone.

    - If more than one leaves together, then split them up

    - Lead him into an ambush of 50k mooks, to tire him out.

    - Once he's tired out, my Hero and three Aces turn up and obliterate him.

    Now I'm down about 50k mooks, and the enemy is down one Hero. I "leak" the info the the enemy that their missing hero is alive and in a certain location.

    Naturally, the other four heroes go to rescue their compatriot, leaving their Ace in charge of the city defenses.

    While they're out, I have my much bigger army take the city.

    --------------

    The heroes find a large bag of money, along with a thank-you note addressed to my spy which implies that said spy should have killed the other three Heroes by now. Alone with the disembodied head of their former companion.

    I estimate that fewer than four Heroes will return from that confrontation, and the remaining Heroes are unlikely to be united. I should be able to pick them off, one by one.

    Honestly this sounds like a world that survives less than a week before befalling one of the horrible fates that would make for an entertaining xkcd 'what if?' question, unless some unspecified force intercedes to prevent most of the things a curious person with a little knowledge might try to do with magic that turn out really deadly.

    Something like Ice-9, an extremely stable form of ice that causes all water it comes in contact with to become Ice-9. Obviously very dangerous. 

    Also, seeing if you can use magic to change properties like melting and boiling point, so you can melt iron at room temperature and no additional pressure (or only small amounts of either).
