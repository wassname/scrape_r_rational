  Is this fic any good? I have read about one fourth and mostly remember a bad writing style and character decisions at a "I am an npc in a terrible anime" level (i.e. mostly nonsensical). 
  Still, I have seen it recommended here a lot. Am I mistaken/does it get better?

    I liked it enough to reread several times, which is utterly weak evidence to you about how much you like it, compared to your experience of not liking it. Book experiences should not need to be social realities. Don't like, don't read.

    I kind off like it but I wouldn't describe it as good. So if you didn't like the first fourth I dout you will like the rest.

    I don't think the quality of the writing changes significantly. If your original problem was with the writing, it probably won't go away.

    If your problem was with the characters, it's a harder question to answer. As the plot progresses, new characters are introduced. I have found some of them more vivid than the original cast while some other new additions were interchangeable.

    The plot mostly sticks to the same formula as Ami desperately tries to stay one step ahead of increasingly powerful enemies. However, it becomes more varied as more and more factions and powers are dragged in. Some battle scenes are elaborately choreographed as multiple factions and actors interact in multiple locations and at multiple levels.

    The most recent 20%+ of the serial put more emphasis on the "adolescent embarrassment" angle, which I find somewhat distracting and repetitive.

    In my opinion, not really. The fans are just too deep in by now to get out.

  It's kinda similar in its premise to PGtE, and it's pretty decent, though not as good as PGtE.

    I find it a wonderful exercise in both rational munchkinry and a fascinating and somewhat sensible expansion of Dungeon Keeper lore.

    How is it similar?  Kat is a street kid trying to survive when she meets up with a villain who is very personable but also genocidal.  She goes in with her eyes open, fully aware of the atrocities she's committing at each step.  She has chances to back down and doesn't take any of them.  The outcomes may or may not be superior, but it would be a hard stretch to call her anything more than an antihero. Personally, she is a brawler who isn't comfortable with science, magic, or politics.  This isn't my interpretation, she's said almost those exact words multiple times.  She has tremendous force of personality and wins by overpowering her opponents.  Through the large majority of the work, her minions are all humans and most of them are generally good people who are loyal to her.

    Compare that to Ami.  She's a teenager from a loving family who has been fighting as a hero against literal monsters.  She's the smart one on the team -- science, analysis, and support, without the power to actually make a difference in combat. (Again, her words and not mine.)  She becomes a Dungeon Keeper purely by accident, without making a deliberate choice or understanding the consequences.  The mere fact that she is a Keeper means that she has a kill on sight order against her from all the Good kingdoms.  She lacks the raw power to outfight her enemies, so she relies on science and trickery.  Her closest advisers are humans and relatively good people, but her minions are literally monsters that enjoy torturing and killing humans.  They are only loyal to her because of a desire for power and/or gold and would turn on her in a second if they discovered who she really is.

    Personally, I enjoy DKA more than PGtE.  Both are good stories, but PGtE becomes a depressing grind after a while.  I wish that DKA would drop the "embarrassed teenager" bit and be a little less free with the fanservice in some places, but it's a fun story with a smart, inventive, and likable heroine.

      I read 3 books of PGtE and the way you talk down the main character is pretty much spot on. The reason I kept reading in the past is I was hoping the every-dudette Foundling will soon grow up resembling Black or Malicia. Both are awesome characters, more worthy as the main. 

      I gotta ask around whether Cat had manifested her own awesomeness by book 5. Awesomeness according to r/rational frequenters taste of course: more wit than brawn, more hardwork than luck, more exploit than grind. I *kinda* running out light-reading material.
