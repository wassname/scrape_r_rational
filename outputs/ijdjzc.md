  I wish I was as good a writer as you were, so that I could find the right words to compliment this chapter. I'll just list the things I liked the most: 

  Goku being on the receiving end of Tao Pai Pai's killing intent.

  Differing effectiveness of HEP II chips.

  Yamcha's problem solving.

  I also see you recommended another fanfiction in the review notes, and I'll definitely be reading that.

  Thanks for the update!

    Thanks a lot! I really care a lot about the Goku vs. Tao fight, so I hope to do it justice and will only be happy if people enjoy it (well, happi-er than the average).

    About the other fanfic, a word of warning - it's not precisely "rational", or rather, it makes things a lot easier for the protagonists and it seems just focussed on making them OP. It's definitely a good read though if "Bulma being a badass" is your jam (as you might deduce from my story, it's definitely mine).

  Is it just me, or Rational!Goku behaves a lot like a young Canon!Gohan ? If so, more please :)
  ```

  - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
    ```
    I never thought about it that way but it makes sense, since canon Gohan is quiet, introverted, smart, and fundamentally pacifistic - though he does learn in time that he can't always avoid fighting. Recently I've watched ATLA for the first time and I think Aang has also affected me a bit (though he's more extroverted and upbeat than OWP!Goku).

  Now that we know that only Commander Black and Bulma knew the location of all seven balls, I wonder how the insurgents managed to find their locations so quickly. Perhaps they had already known from the start as well?

    ```
    Wait, is this a comment for this chapter? It sounds like you're a couple chapters behind. The answer was revealed at the end of chapter 31, it was >!by using Baba the witch, who helped the Instruments!<.
    ```

    - u/_The_Bomb:
      ```
      ...I don’t know how I missed that. That’s honestly rather embarrassing.
      ```

        ```
        Don't worry XD. Also, I've been so slow at posting recently that it probably gets pretty confusing to read.
        ```
