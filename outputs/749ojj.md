## [Challenge Companion] SCP

### Post:

**tl;dr: This is the companion thread for the [writing challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/749k9r/biweekly_challenge_scp/), post ideas, discussion, recommendation, or whatever you want to talk about here.**

Don't know what SCP is? [Visit here,](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) or maybe just go straight to [the top-rated ones](http://www.scp-wiki.net/highest-rated-scps). In short, it's a collection of documents pertaining to anomalous artifact/sites/entities, purported to be part of the SCP Foundation.

I think there's an argument to be made that many SCPs are already "rational", at least in part. A lot of that has to do with the nature of the works, which (tales aside) are meant to represent actual in-universe documents pertaining to the anomalies. If an SCP is written such that the Foundation is doing something really boneheadedly stupid or unbelievable, then the author can get feedback on that. Because the author is encouraged to put themselves in the shoes of the Foundation, which is trying to explore and understand the anomaly, a fair bit of thought naturally goes into modeling an investigator.

If you want to write something that's in the same ballpark (i.e. a secret agency devoted to containing and covering up "anomalies" for some reason), feel free to do that.

  A few of my favorite SCPs:



  [Humans Go Home](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1171). I laughed pretty hard at this.

  [Too Spooky](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2006). Short, funny, slightly unsettling.

  [Mr. Headgeworth's School for the Magically Gifted](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3263). A unique take on Harry Potter-type fantasy. 

  [A Formal Discussion](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-946). Very short. I found this one to be existentially terrifying. 

  [A Doorway to Another World](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2317). What lies beyond depends on your security clearance. 

  [Scripted Nightclub](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-453). On the long side. A nightclub in Italy which induces the patrons to act out scenes from the days of the Roman empire.
