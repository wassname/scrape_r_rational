  I'd been looking forward to seeing how May was dealt with. Satisfying to read.

  I love this story. It is so lifelike, spending time on the things real people spend time on. Cooking, food, and family support are so often ignored in fiction, let alone cape-fics.

  It allows us to get to know, understand, and value all the people he has a relationship with, while giving the greater world and society more color with each slice of life and meal cooked.

  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.

    Spelling check: savery should be savory

      Fixed, thank you.

  One thing I really appreciate about this story is that it shows an underrepresented perspective of the superhero genre, without that being either the main defining characteristic, while also acknowledging that there is, in fact, a difference in experience there.

  It isn't my lived experience, so I'm not certain about the accuracy, so I'm slightly curious to know if it's the author's, but it at least reads as plausible to me from the people I do know, so  good work with that.

  Thanks for writing it, and I can't wait to read more!

  Minor nitpick: Why would a ChemE major have a class on friction? That doesn't really have anything to do with chemical engineering, and it's not complicated enough to warrant a full class. In my ME degree it was covered as part of statics and dynamics.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    She didn't have a full class on friction. It was a general Mech-E class where they covered friction. The phrasing isn't ideal.
