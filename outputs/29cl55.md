  I really like the project so far. I get the same vibe from it as with "Rapture of the Nerds", "Accelerando" and other books I can't recall right now. In all, the protagonist stumbles through a strange hodgepodge world where everything is happening everywhere at once, where whole plot threads open and close again, sometimes within the same paragraph. I guess that could be a danger with this kind of narrative: The main thread can struggle to shine through all that's happening.

  Two things:
  1.) Is S.I. the final, official title? You know, renaming a TvTropes page would be so annoying.
  2.) I always imagine Bunny much like the rabbit-person from Overgrowth. Is that visually accurate?

    It's an issue I've been aware of since before I started writing, when I was just planning a simple road trip through various Adventure Towns. (Would you believe I actually did intend for Bunny to head straight in the direction of Phoenix, instead of, um, pretty much the exact opposite? :)  )


    > Is S.I. the final, official title?

    It stands for a number of things relevant to the story (Self-Important, Self-Indulgent, Signal Integrity, System International, Science & Industry, etc), I haven't thought of a better title in a month, and nobody's made any suggestions - so it seems likely to stick.

    > a TvTropes page

    Anyone who wants to put one up, let me know, so I can stick up at least a placeholder page at a permanent address.


    > the rabbit-person from Overgrowth. Is that visually accurate?

    I haven't paid attention to that one since playing with Lugaru a few years back, but after a quick Google Images search, it seems pretty close.

      I've just put up a temporary page at a permanent home: http://www.datapacrat.com/SI/ .
