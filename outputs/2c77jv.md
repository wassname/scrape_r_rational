  Or, at least, the first draft thereof.

  I found http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/ in my newsfeed today - and it covers a whole set of ideas I'm trying to wrestle into SI. (Edit: Tried to insert spoiler tag here of examples, didn't work.) If anyone reading S.I. sees any spots in what I've written so far where Moloch, Mammon, Ares, Azathoth, or Cthulhu can be shown off better, please, let me know.
