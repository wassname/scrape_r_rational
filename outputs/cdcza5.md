## [MK] Abuse flight in close combat

### Post:

You have the ability to fly. You can toggle this power on and off at will. While this power is active, gravity's effects on you are nullified, and you have the ability to accelerate your body at a rate of 3 meters per second squared.

After some research and experimentation, you have discovered that you do not have to apply the acceleration uniformly across your body. This property was likely originally an automatic measure to ensure that you could remain in a stable orientation during flight, but that mechanic can probably be abused for other measures.

You don't have any superhuman strength or durability (or speed outside of flight), and normally use ranged weapons in combat. However, if you ended up unarmed (or only able to grab clubs or other close combat weapons), what tactics and maneuvers would you employ to get an advantage from your powers and defeat your opponents?

  Assuming the opponent is also unarmed, my initial thought would be to fight them from directly above. You would be able to kick them in the head easily, and they wouldn't be able to reach further than your legs. Heavy boots would be very useful both offensively and defensively. If your opponent manages to grab you, you could fly upward and either escape their grasp or leave them precariously hanging off of you. If you have difficulty dislodging them, you can flip around and make it almost impossible to hang on.

    This.  Assuming you have decent timing as far as turning it on or off, you can also simply drop on them when they grab you, leaving them with a hundred-plus pound weight to handle--from an awkward angle--all of a sudden.  Stomp off them like Mario for extra momentum going back up, if you like.  Presumably very few people, even kung-fu masters, have practice dealing with flying human-sized masses in this world?

  The main character of [Ward](https://www.parahumans.net/about/) is an experienced flier, and uses that power very creatively. It denies opponents any sort of tripping maneuver, it lets her get in positions of maximum leverage faster, she can dodge really well, and she also uses it for stealth.

    My favorite two uses of her power are:

    1) Applying a downward force on herself to give her a sense of pressure, like a weighted blanket

    2) Floating horizontally up the stairs while eating with a plate of food on her belly like a sea otter

    She also has super strength/limited invulnerability, so it's not a strict just flying superpower, though.

  Assuming that's enough force to accelerate the mass of your body at 3m/s/s (essentially making the power generation of X amount momentum (kg\*m/s) per second), you could concentrate the momentum in limbs for quick punches or weapon swings.

  &#x200B;

  To calculate acceleration of portions of body parts: (mass of power user) \* 3m/s/s = total momentum generation, (amount of distributed momentum generation)/(mass accelerated) = acceleration of mass accelerated

  &#x200B;

  If there was space enough to accumulate a lot of linear momentum, stomping from odd angles would be somewhat effective, though not as much as a gravity assisted stomp (imagine jumping and falling in essentially 1/3 earth gravity), and it would be slow and predictable even with regular gravity. Stomps because legs and feet are actually made to take large amounts of force (unlike our spindly fingers and feeble wrists).

  &#x200B;

  Spinning to build up angular momentum would also be useful, though a regular body probably has a pretty low max-comfortable-rpm.

  &#x200B;

  Most useful I think would be general freedom of movement, you no longer need your center of mass always over your feet, you don't have to keep your feet on the ground, and you don't have to push off of anything to move. Most effective I think would either be attacking from directly above and behind the opponent where arms can't reach and turning off gravity nullification sporadically to power attacks (it'd be kinda awkward if acceleration and gravity nullification turned off and on together), or attack from the ground utilizing acceleration in addition to pushing off the ground (again awkward if the power is all or nothing) to outmaneuver, and (assuming using the power isn't tiring) you could probably outlast them by supporting yourself with gravity nullification and using acceleration instead of muscles.

  &#x200B;

  Or maybe sacrifice all the momentum generation into one or both hands to wield a weapon heavier than you would otherwise be able to (a weapon weighing as much as the power user would get 3m/s/s (not enough to lift on its own) in addition to what the power user could output via muscles, lighter is faster)  (unusable if the power is all or nothing because the weapon's center of mass would become your center of mass and you wouldn't be able to stand without the weapon being directly above your feet), though you'd have to be careful of your arms/wrists.

  &#x200B;

  You could also throw stuff, (person mass) \* 3m/s/s of force is a lot of acceleration on something only a few grams, though again: wristlash would be difficult to avoid, though maybe not if you had one of those tennis ball throwers, or even a basket on a stick. You'd have to stop all other acceleration to propel the projectile, ~~and manage conservation of momentum if airborne~~ (nope, you're generating momentum).

  Given the topic I instinctively interpreted that tag as "Mortal Kombat".

  Ahem. 

  I guess the main obvious use is "grab someone, lift them up, drop them from a lethal height, fight is won". It mostly depends on how the power works though - is it *acceleration*, or is it *force*? I'm guessing the first from your formulation so that would imply I can simply apply any acceleration I want no matter what am I lifting; the only thing I need to be able to withstand is the pressure from the load's weight on the body parts I'm using to lift it. Except, if I can fine-tune that whole "control the acceleration in each part of my body", not, because I can accelerate my skin and flesh so that it doesn't get squeezed by the mass above it, countering the effect of the weight. Though the weight will try to go down at 9 m/s^2 so there's still a limit there... unless the only thing that matters is that the *average* over my whole body mass is 3 m/s^2, in which case, yes, I can lift anything as long as I'm willing to do it *very* slowly. Hell, I can push the Earth out of orbit if so I want.

  Another easy use in case I can redistribute the acceleration with local values exceeding 3 m/s^2: punches. Just keep my body absolutely still (heh, imposing an acceleration of *0* m/s^2 also has its uses, I am now literally unmovable), then charge all the acceleration in my right arm, and that's one good hit I get in, without even using my real strength. Or I can sum it with my real strength to enhance my power.

  Gets all a lot trickier if 3 m/s^2 isn't an upper value, but the *only* value allowed. As in, at any time I'm using this power, I *have* to accelerate by 3 m/s^2 in some direction. That's much less useful and much funnier. Though it can probably still be wildly abused.

  i might be confused but, if we're taking the assumption that we're generating a force, and that force is defined as "however much is required to accelerate my body 3 m/s/s" (presumably not including external clothes or equipment), then wouldn't the force increase the heavier you are? You'd want to get built like a sumo wrestler, for the doubled benefits of being stronger and being able to impart more force. (You'd probably want to dress like one too, to minimize the weight of your clothes.)

  Aside from re-interpreting "acceleration" into "force", let's take the rest of the description completely literally: When you toggle the power on, you stop being affected by gravity *and* you gain the ability to apply force to accelerate it to 3m/s/s. Not "up to" 3 m/s/s, it's all or nothing. Presumably, though, you can distribute this force as you wish across your body - if you apply less force to one area you must apply it elsewhere.

  I don't think there's any huge consistency problems in this interpretation...? Anyways taking the above and running with it, aside from wanting to be as heavy as possible you'd be able to briefly use the power to help absorb the force of punches - as the punch approaches you, hop and trigger the power. The punch will spend most of its force knocking you backwards, and if something's behind you you can push off of it and use your power to accelerate back towards the enemy, which will probably be surprising and unintuitive to someone who's used to living in a world where objects don't magically have forces imposed on them in midair.

  Also, the whole "0 or full force" thing isn't much of a problem either I think?. At worst, you can use it to do simple, harmless motions on your limbs like move them in circles, clench and unclench your fingers very quickly, etc rather than moving anywhere. But I'm pretty sure you could also just repeatedly move your entire body in a very little circle, or even just vibrate back and forth, 180ing the direction of your power's force as fast as possible, and effectively stay still in midair.

  In the case that the power causes a constant acceleration and applies arbitrary force to impose it, get your pain tolerance high enough that you can withstand having your hand, wrist, and maybe arm completely broken and then accelerate it through your opponent's ribcage.

  You effectively have the best form of leverage in existence. So long as your body can withstand the forces, you can take hits without moving, and punch much harder than usual. This goes doubly so if you have a weapon. Standing/lying/crouching no longer means anything to you, which means you can do all sorts of stuff to exploit someone's vulnerabilities that result from them being anchored to the ground. You could easily fight from directly above them and they would be at a huge disadvantage, especially since you can so easily get directly behind them. Of course, you can also do some insane throws. Fighting low could also work, maybe, if you can take advantage of the greater dexterity of your arms versus their legs. You could very easily trip someone, or just grab them and fly up. Thinking in 3D is key.
