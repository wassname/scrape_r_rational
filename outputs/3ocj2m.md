  Reddit has long been a hot spot for conversation on the internet. About 57 million people visit the site every day to chat about topics as varied as makeup, video games and pointers for power washing driveways.

  In recent years, Reddit’s array of chats also have been a free teaching aid for companies like Google, OpenAI and Microsoft. Those companies are using Reddit’s conversations in the development of giant artificial intelligence systems that many in Silicon Valley think are on their way to becoming the tech industry’s next big thing.

  Now Reddit wants to be paid for it. The company said on Tuesday that it planned to begin charging companies for access to its application programming interface, or A.P.I., the method through which outside entities can download and process the social network’s vast selection of person-to-person conversations.

  “The Reddit corpus of data is really valuable,” Steve Huffman, founder and chief executive of Reddit, said in an interview. “But we don’t need to give all of that value to some of the largest companies in the world for free.”

  The move is one of the first significant examples of a social network’s charging for access to the conversations it hosts for the purpose of developing A.I. systems like ChatGPT, OpenAI’s popular program. Those new A.I. systems could one day lead to big businesses, but they aren’t likely to help companies like Reddit very much. In fact, they could be used to create competitors — automated duplicates to Reddit’s conversations.

  Reddit is also acting as it prepares for a possible initial public offering on Wall Street this year. The company, which was founded in 2005, makes most of its money through advertising and e-commerce transactions on its platform. Reddit said it was still ironing out the details of what it would charge for A.P.I. access and would announce prices in the coming weeks.

  Reddit’s conversation forums have become valuable commodities as large language models, or L.L.M.s, have become an essential part of creating new A.I. technology.

  L.L.M.s are essentially sophisticated algorithms developed by companies like Google and OpenAI, which is a close partner of Microsoft. To the algorithms, the Reddit conversations are data, and they are among the vast pool of material being fed into the L.L.M.s. to develop them.

  Lovecraft was writing mostly for himself, and based heavily on his own phobias- fish, foreigners, old buildings. So a big part of the horror was based on his personal phobias.

  There's a telepathy issue too. It's fairly common for these entities to contact humanity via some method, pushing alien landscapes and values and feelings into their brains. This discordant telepathy causes many issues.

  So, if your brain is aligned right or wrong- due to science, genetics, alien influence, whatever, these aliens push their brains into yours which predictably drives you insane.

  The situations they put you in are often horrific too.

  Just imagine that the cave is your mind and the train is alien thoughts.

  >When, long ago, the gods created Earth
  In Jove’s fair image Man was shaped at birth.
  The beasts for lesser parts were next designed;
  Yet were they too remote from humankind.
  To fill the gap, and join the rest to Man,
  Th’Olympian host conceiv’d a clever plan.
  A beast they wrought, in semi-human figure,
  Filled it with vice, and called the thing a Nigger.

  Lovecraft's fear of monsters was based on a real fear of black people.

  Maybe because it shows, that things we thought as axioms may be just outliers from a higher perspective. That there is really no stability in universe, not a single safe place. It doesn't matter where you are. Either on the street, in your house or locked in safe you are always exposed. Exposed to beings, that we don't understand and, what's worse, that don't understand us.

    How is that different from everyday life, exactly? Or at least everyday life for a human from before germ theory? When millions died from causes no-one could comprehend (and which obviously didn't understand us), when Aristotelean or Newtonian physics were the norm, both being outliers/vague allusions to General Relativity. Stuck in a universe where logic is provably unprovable.

    Not to mention some of us here are trying to create the closest thing to a Lovecraftian God that fits in our universe - a post-singularity AI - to prevent the summoning of a merely apathetic one which would kill humanity or worse.

      >How is that different from everyday life, exactly?

      There is exactly one way the real world is.  Lovecraftianism is an *attitude*, not a coherent space of counterfactual worlds.  Literally everything can be taken as Lovecraftian if you just apply the *attitude* to it that *anything slightly different from you, the author, is A HORRIBLE XENO YOU JUST CAN'T SHARE A FUCKING UNIVERSE WITH*.

      I mean, for God's sakes, if they can turn *My Little Pony* and *science* into Lovecraftian horror, then I think that's solid fucking proof that Eldritch Cosmic Horror is actually just the choice to scream and cry at the universe for not being optimized to your particular personal liking.

      The difference is that Abrahamic religions really go out of their way to set up an awesome God.God is not just good, he's perfectly good. He's the ground for all safety.

      But now...God isn't God. It's this slimy, scaly thing that possesses all the horror of God with none of the anthropocentric bullshit. 

      Oh, and you actually saw it. It's one thing to believe something, another to *see* it. You *know*.

        >God is not just good, he's perfectly good. He's the ground for all safety.

        Not at all.  Abrahamic religion is the Trope Originator for Holy Is Not Safe.

        > But now...God isn't God. It's this slimy, scaly thing that possesses all the horror of God with none of the anthropocentric bullshit. 

        You mean God is suddenly a slimy, scaly thing instead of [one of these](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherub#/media/File:Human-headed_Winged_Bulls_Gate_Khorsabad_-_Louvre_01a.jpg) or [this fucking guy](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5c/Raffael_099.jpg) or living, speaking pillars of cloud, smoke, fire, and lightning?

        So basically, what you're really saying is, you're more scared of seafood and reptiles than of things you have every reason to run away from, and yet every knowledge that you *cannot possibly* run away from?

          Most people who believe in a god, believe it's theirs, like the cultists who summon chuthulu. yes, if you asked them, objectively, if each of the actions their god does are evil, without context, they might call them evil, still they delude themselves it's good. If they are a good person, the good afterlife awaits, with their all powerful god or gods that does things that they'd curse mortals for. Woe unto those who mistake evil for good.

          [assuming psudeo-abrahamic god now. not getting into massive pantheons or reincarnation cycles]

          the others don't care. might makes right, and God is the mightiest of all. if you follow his rules, you're safe. old testament, it was probably terrifying, but now, the rules are actually plausible enough to ensnare people. He promises everything people want, immortality included, and if God were real, serving him might be the most rational action for a sociopath. He's irredeemaly alien and mostly malicious to humanity, but if you play by his rules, you can have eternity for yourself, and he's the monster protecting you.

          Part of the lovecraftian fear is it doesn't have rules, really. there isn't a way to escape, isn't a way to protect yourself. not like demons, with circles of salt, or fae and cold iron, vampires and (sunlight, OCD, holy water, fire). not like god and angels, who if you follow his rules, you'll get the afterlife, even if it doesn't protect you now. 

          Lovecraft's gods are unpredictable, and uninterested in ruling. That's the difference, if there is one.

          You can't run from either. God maintains the pretense of morality, which is more comforting.  

          Even if he's a dick to you like he was to Job he still nominally maintains love of your eternal soul. With those stakes who gives a fuck about pettier shit?

            Lovecraft's own protagonists seem to do a remarkably good job of both running and hiding from Lovecraft's whatever.  They never have to deal with the shit that Jonah, for example, did.

            Also, God maintains nominal love of your eternal soul?  Ok, normally I try not to openly diss on things that are actually important to real people, but *you've gotta be fucking kidding me*.  Oh jolly wonderful, the soul can spend eternity in fully-aware but fully wireheaded praise and contemplation of God Himself!  Such love, many eternal, wow so good.

        As a child I once skimmed the Old Testament out of curiosity. Besides the boredom and my annoyance about not being able to figure out where the Samson story was hiding, I noticed a most *REMARKABLE* number of admonitions to fear God. I got the impression that worship was good but fear was an order of magnitude better.

  I've heard this before. The best reasoning I've heard is Lovecraftian monsters move through extra dimensions. Presume you were 2d in a 2d world, and a crazy complex 3d object intersects your 2d plane. You don't know what it is, it keeps changing in size/shape/mass completely at random, and it's hostile. Humans are scared of things they can't control, so if the subject can't escape an unpredictable hostile *thing*, loss of sanity is reasonable over time
