  This comic reminded me why I love Subnormality, but then again, most of them do. Comics with too much text are underrated.

    I quite agree. Then again, I adore long works... there's a reason Homestuck is one of my favorites.

    Exactly what I came to say: I keep forgetting to catch up on Subnormality, then do a binge that reminds me all over again how shamefully obscure it is. It's hard to get people into comics that are so imposingly large, but as far as webcomics go, it's up there with the best of the best, even if it's not a "funny" one like xkcd or smbc, or even Dresden Codak.
