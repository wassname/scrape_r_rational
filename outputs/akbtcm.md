  Style is OK, but should still be internally consistent.

  I actually prefer Fantasy worlds? But more to Brandon's type, where there are rules behind the magic.

  Realism is a complicated concept, and its arguably only tangential to what /r/rational readers care about. Often, we care more about _consistency_ - the property of a work that takes its premise seriously and follows it to a logical conclusion - and if _every_ logical conclusion is narratively or stylistically unsatisfying, goes back and works with a slightly different premise.

  Personally, I greatly enjoy stylized works, but I do prefer it if they put in the effort to make that style a reasonable expression of the story, not something that forces the story where it wouldn't otherwise have gone.

  I care a great deal about verisimilitude more than realism per se. An example of stylized worldbuilding that nonetheless is verisimilitudinous is Naomi Novik's Temeraire series: the facts that dragons have mystical powers; that they evolved sapience in parallel with humans; that the political landscape of the world at the start of the series is exactly the Napoleonic Wars despite the ancient point of divergence being sufficient to play complete havoc with history... none of these are explained. But when you grant the author this conceit and allow her to tell her unrealistic story, the Temeraire series handles social, political, military, and economic issues with an admirable eye for the believable and consistent: verisimilitude over realism.

    I think I just found my new favorite word.

    The problem with Temeraire is that the world *immediately* begins to diverge, from the second the story starts. As inevitably it would have to, because you have frigate-sized monsters with their own culture and intelligence suddenly asking "Wait why am I fighting for this empire that treats me like a literal animal?" Given that dragons have been around forever in this world, it makes zero sense that their world would have developed exactly like ours. It was pretty clear she came up with "Dragons and Napoleonic wars" and then worked forward from there without ever considering the circumstances that set it up.

    Which is of course your point- grant the author that (gigantic) conceit, and everything develops logically. But that grant was so mind-bogglingly huge that it completely undermined the story for me. There can't be any verisimilitude if the world clearly could not have operated on the principals that guide the story!

      Sure; different people will have different tolerances for granting the author their conceit. In general I am willing to allow almost any premise, no matter how nonsensical, as long as things then *unfold* in ways that don't strain my suspension of disbelief.

      Put another way: I have no problem with Star Wars being a scifi universe with FTL so advanced that crossing the galaxy is the work of, like, a week tops, but all their attempts at AI have guttered out at "person-level," all their aliens being essentially human in psychology, psychic powers, etc. All of that is part of the premise, and I'm willing to let them have the premise they like to tell the story. What I *do* have a problem with is the scene in The Last Jedi where jumping to hyperspace was an astonishingly-effective kamikaze anti-capital-ship tactic, because it was a sudden introduction of a new element that *did not fit* with what came before. Is it *more* ridiculous than any of the other things I mentioned? Not at all, not in a vacuum. But it broke verisimilitude: the world of Star Wars does not look like how a world where hyperdrive allows for ludicrously powerful kinetic strikes should look. Mid-story developments get held to a higher standard in my book.

  Can you expand on what you mean by style and realism?

  I think that style triumphs all if you're using it the way I mean. If the style of your story is an exploratory piece of incoherent descriptions or something then of course having a random but realistic car crash seems worthless.

  Surely realism is a style too after all? Unless you're simulating your world and even then it's your choice to write it as simulated. 

  The rational community likes UNSONG a lot which isn't very realistic but is very stylisticly consistent.

  I think it's important to be consistent in style, unless you're making a metacommentary about style then your metastyle should be consistent at least.

    Some of the rational community... I really wanted to like it and stuck to it for a long time just for the sake of the terrible puns and in-jokes, but eventually gave up.

    Dammit it's not letting me hide the spoiler. I forget how to do that and it's not letting me see it in the sidebar. Maybe if i try a different browser than firefox?

    UNSONG technically is consistent with its premises, even though it's not realistic. Basically the premise of the story is "What if hebrew scripture had been correct? What would that mean? What evidence would have been needed to demonstrate this? What would the world have looked like if judeochristian dogma was true?" UNSONG is Scott's answer to that question. >!It takes place in a world that runs on narrative, aka "placebomancy", sort of like in PGTE. Except that in UNSONG everything is made of narrative parts all the way down, to the point where everything obeys nominative determinism even if it's not always clear how right away. instead of a few individuals having NAMES which mean something about their roles, EVERYONE and EVERYTHING in the world has names which mean something about them and this is not a coincidence because nothing is ever a coincidence. and the archangel Uriel casts a spell that temporarily exchanges everything in the world for their tegmark mathematical construct equivalents over the course of thousands of years, until someone tries to send a rocket into space and they hit a crystal sphere/wall around the earth and find out that outer space doesn't exist and that was just projected by Uriel's spell, and uriel's spell breaks, causing everyone to return back to the real narrative version of the world.!<

  Now that I think about it, I'm really not sure which I prefer. I enjoy works with thorough and internally consistent worldbuilding, like Unsounded. On the other hand, there are totally bizarre works like Swiss Army Man and IT HURTS that also resonate with me. I guess the key factor for me is emotional resonance, and as long as that's there I just shift gears into "appreciating the realism" or "appreciating the style" depending on what I'm reading/watching.

  Style will always win out. However, the challenge is how much realism an author can fit in before it starts running up against the limitations of the medium, or before adding more realism severely diminishes the enjoyability of reading the story.

  (Of course, a good author, with a strong grasp of the medium and its limitations, will often be able to fit in more of both than a more comparatively unskilled author. Hopefully, though, with time and experience, the latter may eventually become the former.)
  ```

- u/Argenteus_CG:
  ```
  Style by far, but style with internal consistency. Things don't need to be "realistic" by our standards, but they need to operate under a consistent set of rules (or at least a consistent set of metarules, if it's part of the setting that the rules of reality are malleable).
  ```

- u/Norseman2:
  ```
  I'm a fan of realism. For a simple example, consider the semi-autobiographical Grave of the Fireflies. The problems encountered in the movie/story (depending on which you have seen) are portrayed realistically, and you can learn about how to anticipate, recognize and manage real-life problems based on the story. It's a tragedy, but it's still grounded in enough realism to help provide a better understanding of the world.
