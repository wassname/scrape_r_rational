  Hey everyone, today's book recommendation is going to be for [The Long Walk](http://amzn.to/2ip01zO), by Stephen King.  We talked a lot about top-down stories being about political or social issues that the author wants to explore through their fiction, but that's not the only form they take.  Top-down storytelling can also result from a central premise that has less to do with any particular message or idea, and more to do with the theme you want to evoke, or the plot you want to explore.

  Stephen King is a master of this, often so laser focused on the theme or tone or "what-if" that his worldbuilding is left to a bare minimum. Sometimes that what-if is "what if a whole town got slowly turned into monsters, but retained their sense of self throughout?"  Other times that "what if" is "What if a husband and wife go to a cabin for some kinky sex, but he has a stroke while she's handcuffed to the bed?"

  The Long Walk is probably my favorite of these, in part because of how simple it is. "What if 100 boys had to walk for as long as they could, with the last one standing winning a prize and everyone else getting killed?" King could have spent pages and pages talking about the dystopian state that America has turned into, where such a grisly game is a celebrated national event, but he doesn't care about any of that, and through the power of his writing and characters, soon neither will you. All that matters are these 100 young men who, over the course of a few exhausting, endless days, will walk themselves to death, side by side, knowing that only one of them will survive, knowing that it's better not to form any bonds with their competitors... but helpless not to.

  The Long Walk was written all the way back in 1979, predating both Hunger Games and its inspiration, Battle Royale, for deathgame stories. It's not for everyone, but I personally loved the book, and recommend it to anyone interested in seeing how an author can get away with as little worldbuilding as possible, focusing the story with a razor focus on just the idea they built their plot around. If you want to give it a listen, head on over to [Audible](http://www.audibletrial.com/rational) to get a free 30 day trial and book credit, or check out the link in the shownotes to buy the novel. Thanks for listening!

    I love these kinds of stories. In case you didn't mention them in the podcast, any notable mentions?

  I never thought I'd be so hyped for a Hermione/Draco slashfic.
