## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  [Ship's Council](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/ships-counsel-tng-other-insert-au.745996/) Is a new one for me at least. It's a Star Trek The Next Generation AU wherein people are more intelligent than canon. (Maintaining proper Medical and technological quarantines and air gaps for example)

  The story is a retelling starting with the Farpoint Station message, and goes though most of the episodes, some canon stores are simple 'skipped' over and are simply log entries as they are solved so quickly. At other points whole new 'episodes' are constructed to keep the overall plot moving forwards. 

  Told most from the perspective of a Ship's Ethics / legal council who is not Diana Troi. 

  It's about as rational as you can be with some of the insanity that is Star Trek without removing some of it's zanny things like telepathy. So it's best rational adjacent. 

  I in particular like that thing which were too 'big' to be included on the TV show are included. Like Cetacean worlds and interactions. 

  Spolier if you care: 

  >!In particular the changes to the Borg is far more insidious and threatening. Rather than brute force, the Borg optimize their approaches to civilizations, offering technology, trade, 'peace' to optimally place themselves before 'doing the will of the people' and assimilating species wholesale. They're friendly, and know how to play sympathies and polities to get what they want, still with a willingness to sacrifice cubes and millions of drones on a whim.!<

    Just wanted to say thanks, I was skeptical about Star Trek fanfiction but this was excellent. 

    Starts out as a minimalist, episodic fix-fic and then it sneaks up on you and turns into a legitimate story. Very enjoyable.

  Hey, I'm the writer of Ex Nihilo, Nihil Supernum over on Royal Road, and since I'm rather burnt out on it, because writing rationalist fiction is rather hard, I decided to indulge in something I've been thinking of for a bit, namely a parody Xianxia novel.

  Presenting [The Dao of Simulation ](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/71998/the-dao-of-simulation-sci-fi-xianxia-crackfic):

  >Isaac Kai was a pretty normal dude living in the 21st century, having lived a rather unremarkable life until a few of his investments paid off big time and he volunteered for an experimental mind upload program during the First Singularity. He then went on to live for a few million years, with little to show for it except a few quadrillion descendants. 

  >But for the Isaac running in a historical Ancestor Simulation set in 2023, his lack of fame is his downfall. He's the perfect pawn for a Cultivation Sim on the brink of bankruptcy, desperate to pay off its mounting debts.

  >Chosen by an underpaid and overworked AI with a questionable sense of humor. Isaac is yanked from his comfortable, albeit boring, existence and thrust into a world that's as rich and complex as it is utterly bonkers.

  >Welcome to "The Dao of Simulation", where game development has gone off the rails and the laws of physics are more like mild suggestions. Isaac must navigate this new reality, where death is a one-way ticket to oblivion and a million Ancestor Worshippers are watching his every move.

  >It's Xianxia but the author is abusing his Ritalin script. Nobody knows if the aliens are supposed to be there or not, but it's intentional that you can just be Cultivating and minding your own business till a peasant finds a railgun. Buckle up!


  It's a crackfic, no doubt about it, but I'd still wager it's somewhat rat-adjacent. Does anyone know which Reddit communities might be a good place to share it further?

  A few weeks ago someone recommended *[Time To Orbit: Unknown](https://derinstories.com/2022/06/04/001-the-problem-with-the-javelin-program/)* here, and I've finally caught up today. It's great. Not sure how to properly describe it, though; the best I can do is "hard sci-fi mystery with satisfying answers and excellent character writing."

  And I want more! Does anyone have recs for hard sci-fi mysteries with satisfying answers and excellent character writing?

    A fairly decent story but after reading all available chapters, my personal rating is 5 / 10.

    There's a great atmosphere of mystery. The author really nailed the sense of "what happened to the crew" and "what is going on with the ship" quite well. Which is why I trudged through all the chapters.

    I just can't get past how absolutely stupid the MC is. I don't think I'm spoiling anything here but just in case.

    >!When the MC is woken up and discovers the entire crew is dead but there's a job that must be done, the MC just accepts this. No thought or action taken to find out what happened to the crew. Just blindly moves along and completes his task.!<

    >!What if there was a biological outbreak, momentary failure in the shielding systems, or who knows alien boarding action. The story wasn't set up for any of these but if something killed the entirety of the previous crew, the lack of any initial information gathering on the immediate dangers before setting out for life threatening work is just mind boggling.!<

    >!Selection of crew to wake up was equally as questionable. Not to mention how long it took him to finally do so. Saving lives is great and the story has plenty of trolley scenarios but all the choices are bad because of the stupidity in the events leading up to it.!<

    >!Okay, the AI woke the MC up specifically to complete a task. He decides to commit entirely to completing said task without attempting to obtain information about the apparent emergency that requires him, a completely unqualified civilian, to conduct the task instead of anyone else. Not to mention, if there is any sort of written instructions on how to accomplish the task in case of manual actions.!<

    >!Thankfully, there were no apparent requirements from the MC other than pushing the metaphorical big red button to start the engines. But now he's alone and he reasonably recognizes he's entirely unqualified for any further tasks. What does he do? Continues to attempt to man the ship solo until it is literally slammed into him to get some more hands to help out.!<

    >!The doctor's a reasonable choice, no complaints there, but the rest of the first awoken informal crew? Pardon my words but what the fuck is this qualification metric? Most likely to die when woken up? Hello? What about the actual important qualities to help man a 5,000 person colony ship. Relevant skills? Prior experience? Personality traits?!<

    >!If the MC already knows he's completely unqualified for being the captain, then WAKE UP THE FIRST CAPTAIN. Caring about "oh, they didn't sign up for more crew time in space" as a valid reason to not wake up any of the first crew is complete bullshit. This is a emergency situation. The second crew shift is dead. A ring containing 1,000 colonists is about to be ejected into space with a single push of a button.!<

    >!If you take them up now, they might die from old age before they get to walk on solid colony ground but they signed up for this. They're the ones qualified to handle emergency scenarios and understand the full risk to any action that needs to be taken. This is the only trolley problem that needs to be considered and it's blatantly obvious where that track should go.!<

    >!Wake at least the Captain up. WAKE THEM UP. I don't care that there was valid reason to not wake up any of the old crew that was revealed later on but with the information provided to the MC at the start of the story, the choice to create a hodgepodge crew out of the most endangered COLONISTS, not crew, not most qualified specialists, was so stupid I had to chop off half the points.!<

    The story's quality and characters were interesting enough (for the first half at least) to carry me though reading the rest of the chapters but the stupidity of several major choices has made me recommend this as a "don't think about what you're reading" sort of story.

    Which is sorta difficult as this is a mystery/horror story. It invites the reader to think about what they've read and any hints the author drops. Which then leads to these blatant holes in the MC and other characters' logic that just make me tear my non-existant hair out.
    ```

    - u/DangerouslyUnstable:
      ```
      I really disagree with this assesment of the story. Yeah, the decisions are maybe not optimal but they are absolutely believable decisions that a real person would make, and I thought the story did a good job of explaining why there made. A rational story does _not_ need to involve perfect decision making. It just needs to not involve carrying the idiot ball. It can sometimes be a subtle distinction, but bad decisions are sometimes perfectly in line with who the character is, and I think that this is the case with this story.

      That's not to say that you have to like it, or that you need to keep reading it if you don't enjoy it (or even that I think you are objectively wrong), but I thought it would be useful to offer a counter opinion. For me at least, the decision making was in line with the characters and they were well justified within the context of the story, even when I personally wouldn't have done what the characters did.
      ```

      - u/Samarium149:
        ```
        Okay maybe a bit of my personal experience is bleeding into my assessment of the story. I work in optimizing offsite emergency planning at nuclear power plants. They're not space ships but I would like to equate them as similar levels of complexity and risk when attempting to fix system faults. Especially with the newer generation of advanced reactor designs where more automation is being implemented and staffing requirements are being reduced under 10 CFR 53.

        Can I see an average Joe handed the keys to the kingdom decide to commit to actions taken by the MC, yes definitely. In fact, we do address this in crisis management steps at nuclear power plants and hammer into operators to have designated qualified individuals make the calls when necessary instead of doing it themselves when situations deviate from written procedure. That's not to say qualified individuals are perfect, we have something called [cockpit resource management](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crew_resource_management) in the airline industry to improve decision making by enforcing interpersonal communication. Along similar lines, Three Mile Island was a combination of a lot of problems ranging from mechanical failure to poor instrumentation and control and the human factor in inadequate emergency procedures and operator training made it ultimately the worst nuclear disaster in America.

        I do not consider characters making believable decisions as the bar to call stories Rational. It's what makes a story *good* yes, but not rational. I also do not expect the most optimal of decision making, that implies perfect knowledge of the future. But I do draw the line at expecting characters to make *rational* decisions. Humans are not rational, despite what economics assumes them to be, and only through proactive emergency planning and mitigation strategies can limited resources be used in the most effective way to save the maximum amount of lives.

        Which comes back to the reason why I do not consider this story as rational. The main character fails to consider the entire risk spectrum for the decisions he makes and is unwilling to take the most basic step in acquiring a fully qualified individual (i.e., the first shift's captain) once the immediate emergency situation has been addressed and the time to do so becomes available.

        It's a good read nonetheless and I do recommend it.
        ```

          I have no real opinion on the story but thank you for the interesting examples from your job.
          ```

      - u/vaphyren:
        ```
        A rational protagonist doesn't need to have perfect decision making, but not carrying the idiot ball isn't enough. 

        A rational protagonist is one that tries to make the best decision to achieve their goals. Mistake in execution are allowed, but they are *not* allowed to miss blindingly obvious solutions that readers can see. They can consider such solutions and discard them because or moral reasons or sentimental or emotional reasons, but not noticing the solution in the first place isn't allowed. 

        When the missed solution is obvious enough and central to the plot, it becomes a full-on plot hole. 

        The mistake that /u/Samarium149 describes seems pretty central to the plot. It's like what if the council of Elrond scene just decided that they need to take the ring to Mount Doom without explaining that the ring was indestructible otherwise. It would have been perfectly believable (everyone just trusts Gandalf's judgement) but it'll look like a plot hole. It's why the scene takes the time to consider giving the ring to Tom Bombadil. A more rational LOTR would have even considered and dismissed the Eagles solution.

  Anyone have any recommendations for Pokemon-like stories that aren't Pokemon, specifically English web novels? I love the premise of having animal companions and adventuring around, but I could never get into Pokemon because the gameplay felt too simple, at least in FireRed and HeartGold, which is worsened by the fact that I want to try out all the new pokemon but they all seem to play really similarly to each other, at least in the beginning. And the few times I've tried reading a pokemon story I feel like I'm expected to know how everything looks. I'm very familiar with different real life animals but I don't know any pokemon outside of pickachu and charizard and mewtwo, and maybe a few others.

  I've read every translated Chinese web novel with this premise already, and I think they've above average in quality in comparison to other types. 

  I think it's an ideal progression story premise. You can have a bunch of varied companions with different powers, but they don't need a lot of character development or backstory. It also allows for very varied fighting styles. If the main character is alone and they have high CON and INT, usually they'll just end up relaying on whichever is more efficient. But with this you can have interesting 1v1 or group fights. I think it makes for way more interesting and dynamic fights. But you also don't suffer from the common relationship drama that will inevitably end up happening in teams of people that I personally cannot stand that. And maybe I'm misremembering, but they're also almost never harems, which is another big plus. And most importantly, animals are cute. 

  Also, if anyone knows of some Pokemon romhacks that makes it easier to swap pokemon around and makes the combat more engaging, I'd like that too.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think for English language, pokemon fanfic is the place for creature battling, you can just keep bulbapedia or google image search open in another tab to understand what the pokemon are. I do that when authors bring in the new generations since I am only familiar with the first 3 generations.

    In terms of games, there have been a few recent indie releases that make the combat more complex if you search online. There is definitely a market for that since the main pokemon brand will always be simple, it's made for children after all.

    There’s Codex Alera and On Lavender Tides, both original takes on Pokémon. Codex was Jim Butcher saying “I can write whatever and it’d be good” and then someone suggested a Pokémon x 9th Roman Legion mashup story and he wrote it. Unflatteringly, On Lavender Tides was really easy to bounce off of, but probably also really easy to get into if you didn’t grow up playing Pokémon and stuff. 



    Deep cut recommendation; there’s a few “Pokédex” style fics out there. There’s one on SB that’s solid that I could go find if you want. I think you might get something out of those! They all do something a little different. Some are more pseudoscience-y and jargon-y descriptions and some are more story like, with cute interactions showcasing the uniqueness of each Pokémon.
    ```

    - u/Smartjedi:
      ```
      Okay wow, I'm a big Dresden Files fan and from the little blurbs given at the back of those books I always thought Codex Alera was pure medieval high fantasy. This may have actually sold me on trying it.

    Obscure rom recommendation, I choose you!

    Try Dragon Warrior Monsters for the original Game Boy. It's a little more varied and out there than Pokemon, and a good amount harder. (Pokemon is usually stupidly easy, though I haven't played more recent games.)

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Warrior_Monsters

    I've only played the first something like 25 years ago, but replayed it a few years ago on ROM and it held up. There's a whole series if you get into it.

  - u/CatInAPot:
    ```
    Apocalypse Tamer by Voidherald seems like it fits pretty well with what you're looking for.

    I'd recommend checking out Pokemon Reborn (or Pokemon Rejuvenation, my personal favorite). The games are considered quite difficult, and it has level caps between gyms so you're basically forced to expand and experiment with your roster.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:

    If you're okay with non progression fantasy stuff, then Robin Hobb's Farseer series is *all* about having animal companions and adventuring around. Emotionally heavy though, very heavy.

  This is a little left field, but since I mostly get my webfiction reccos from here, I rarely have much to contribute in terms of fiction. That being said I think I tend to be a bit more varied and felt I have to recommend a couple of video essays from Jacob Geller. Video games don't deserve Jacob, that's how much I love his work - he connects various ideas and media and reality and weaves them into one beautiful essay.

  The first is the [The conceptual failure of orbital lasers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntLc4hHWqHs). I've been visiting old friends before starting my next job and this video gets put on at every friends place and we sit enraptured for the entire runtime. Jacob weaves a narrative about orbital space lasers, their fictional semantic equivalent to nukes (hence why they seem to feature heavily in japanese stories) and the stories about them fundamentally driving conflict and even links to Reagan's space laser initiative almost creating conflict until it ended up failing.

  The other one I love [Unbearable Bright Realities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2DP-A6FhA0) about the nature of truth and story telling. He goes through historical retellings and how reports are greatly exaggerated. It's engrossing storytelling.

  Jacob's other stuff is great too, his video on [Judaism, Whiteness and Wolfenstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQQdnve5fQk) was my first intro to his work and while his content was great back then, his polish and detail has levelled up significantly.
  ```

  - u/Cosmogyre:
    ```
    Hey, I just started watching his videos too, I got introduced by his newest video, [Games That Don't Fake the Space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q85l1Fenc5w). Really love his channel, and how he brings lots of unique game examples, which I can then go play if I'm interested.

  I read [What We Do to Survive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/51307/what-we-do-to-survive) after it was recommended here a couple weeks ago.

  I somewhat liked the no morals dynamic against the backdrop of a magical school. The students are allowed and all but encouraged to murder/kidnap/enslave their peers in the pursuit of their goals, but within specific guidelines like not being able to target people more than a grade under you. So there's stuff like kidnapping another student and torturing them into swearing a magical oath, but then when some powerful archmage breaks into a students room, the headmaster slaps them down and forces them to apologize. I could do without the sexist undertones where it just so happens that the main character is male and all the people he kidnaps happen to be women.

  Does anyone have any other recommendations for magical school stories where lots of morally questionable stuff happens with the permission of the teachers?
  ```

  - u/DRMacIver:
    ```
    The Scholomance series by Naomi Novik is an obvious choice for magical school with morally questionable behaviour by the students, although it's not exactly with the permission of the teachers because the scholomance doesn't exactly have teachers. It's with the permission of the people who run the school from afar though.

    It's a very good series, although it's also very nakedly a political critique about the behaviour of the wealthy, so whether it appeals may depend on how up you are for that.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    [Nowhere Island University](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/5817/nowhere-island-university) sorta has an extreme danger school vibe, although it doesn't exactly take place in a magic school. It does have dark stuff happening but students aren't encouraged to torture each other. Interesting story though nonetheless.

  - u/linig4:
    ```
    From your description, this quest

    https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/polyhistor-academy-original-setting-survival-quest.614/

      Does it get any better? I know it's a quest, but I got to the end of the first chapter where the protagonists roommate tried to kill him and then literally started crying anime tears. It's really long, so I'd love to like it, but that's a rough start.
      ```

      - u/linig4:
        ```
        Tbh I read it pretty long ago, so can’t really comment on “getting better”, but if you mean whether all characters/dangerous situations are as wacky as the roommate, then no, it’s not a representative example IIRC.

  Two things I've been into recently.

  **Columbo** (on Amazon/FreeVee). Good mysteries where you see the murder and then watch Columbo solve it. Often he makes an intuitive leap which isn't quite rational, but he usually does something interesting/surprising to turn that intuition into proof. Also, if you didn't live through the 70s (I did) it's wild to see how some things have changed (or the styles).  

  The Terra Ignota series (starting with **Too Like the Lightning**)  mixes an SF world with an 18th century pampleteering writing style. Calling it rational would be a stretch, but it is chock full of interesting ideas, and that's why I come to this sub for recs. If you can survive the first fifty pages and be intrigued, its probably for you.
  ```

  - u/sl236:
    ```
    Columbo is pretty rational IMO, just not when it comes to solving the murder - that's not how he operates. His forte is being a huge troll. The murder-solving itself may be half intuition, but the part where he calmly, logically, systematically, inevitably irritates the culprit into incriminating themselves is glorious every time.
    ```

    - u/Amonwilde:
      ```
      It's probably not rational, but it is really good. It's basically a class comedy where Columbo as a lower-class person makes a fool of an upper-class person. The few episodes that don't follow this format as much (like the one where Johnny Cash is the murderer) aren't as good.
      ```

  I'm having a dungeon building itch again, and looking for some good and lengthy dungeon building. Please recommend some good dungeon building novels. The criteria: fun dungeon building, and writing that isn't bad. Yes, it's a very low bar, but that's just how bad these novels are. Examples of bad dungeon builders: The Divine Dungeon(the last 2 volumes are horrid), Dungeon Core Online(all that needs to be said is that the MC is a Gamer).

  Yeah, I'm really desperate for anything here. Even the "good" dungeon builders have character writing and story worse than your average Asian web novel, fanfic, or RR litrpg. I've read The Divine Dungeon, Bone Dungeon, Dinosaur Dungeon, Cat Core, DCO, Dungeon without a System, Dungeon Core Chatroom, and most of the ones by Jonathan Brooks.

  Please tell me you know of any good dungeon builders at least a few volumes in length. Man I'm desperate.

It's been some time since I read it, but I remember it being pretty solid. Mizuno Ami (Sailor Mercury) from Sailor Moon gets transmigrated into a world vaguely based on the Dungeon Keeper games and immediately gets stuck as a Dungeon Keeper, making her the enemy of pretty much everyone.

    Not a novel, but Dungeon Odyssey is a manhwa that's about a guy who becomes a dungeon owner. It has a really cute artstyle and fun characters. One of my favorites.

    You've probably read it already though.

  I’m derec-ing The Exalt [Cultivation Fantasy] by Mistapak due to never resolving story beats and abandoning main characters. Not going to spoil, it has a great start and the budding romance really drew me in, but the choices the author went made it into a completely different story.

  I’m recommending the Scholomance series by Naomi Novik. Just read it. Please I’m begging you.

  I’m recommending Super Supportive by Sleyca on RR. A superhero novel with a slice of Aliens and magic that draws you in and entrances you. The MC shows outstanding resolve in the face of extreme danger and it is a joy to experience his story.

    I'm curious, I've seen Super Supportive recommended a lot around here lately, but I read up to Chapter 40 and found it to just be the MC going around doing little quests for the professor? Like there didn't seem to be anything of substance. No real conflict, no deeper mysteries to the universe, and the whole global heroes and villains thing seemed pretty tame with the alien empire backdrop.

      It is very slice of life, I agree. Like a lot of RR novels, the plot is quite slow. I think you quit only a little bit before my favorite arch of the story.

  Just for yucks, here's all the stuff that I'm **not** caught up with recently:

  * I Am Going To Die (In This Game-Like Dimension) - only started on the last book
  * Beware of Chicken - Haven't started book 4 yet
  * Shipcore
  * The Game at Carousel: A Horror Movie LitRPG
  * He Who Fights With Monsters
  * Unfathomable Power for the Low, Low Price of Someone Else's Soul - only just started book 2
  * Stray Cat Strut - chapter 56, two years ago
  * Thresholder - chapter 18
  * Renewal: A Daughter of Fate
  * Ex Nihilo, Nihil Supernum
  * Zenith of Sorcery
  * Hyperstitious
  * Someone Vanquish Me! - but this updates very slow, so not really far behind

  Non RR:

  * Project Lawful / Planecrash - right around the end of  IMSIYUDT part 2 - The Methods of Rationality Podcast
  * Oh God Not Again! (Harry Potter)
  * What's Her Name in Hufflepuff
  * Danse Macabre (Star Wars SI, sequal to Path of Ruin)
  * The New Man: An Adam Smasher SI (Cyberpunk Edgerunners)
  * Falling Apart (Harry Potter, Snape PoV, time travel)
  * A Subtle Knife (Worm SI)
  * The Last Angel (original)
  * The Wheel Unbroken (Game of Thrones)

      You're welcome.

      I just noticed something kind of funny. On my ["caught up"](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1522sk0/d_monday_request_and_recommendation_thread/jsbz58a/) list, those are all original settings and not fan fiction. And all the fan fiction is on the "not caught up" list.  This may indicate a shifting of my reading priorities...

  I'm looking for stories that touch on the theme of nihilism and ultimately decide that if life is meaningless then we all matter.

    I'd read some 20th-centry existential literature, they were big into this back then. Also these are truly great works and quite readable.

    [Grendel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grendel_\(novel\))  
    [Endgame](https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/3346220/mod_resource/content/1/ENDGAME%20BY%20SAMUEL%20BECKETT.pdf)  
    [Arcadia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_\(play\))

    I apologize for spamming up the thread, but I'm going to excerpt some Grendel. If people complain I can edit.

    The conversation is between Grendel (the mortal monster from Beowulf) who is the protagonist and an immortal, all-knowing dragon. 

    > After another long pause, he said: “Approach it this way. Let us take this jug.” He picked up a golden vessel and held it toward me, not letting me touch it. In spite of himself, as it seemed, he looked hostile and suspicious, as if he thought I might perhaps be so stupid as to snatch the thing and run. “How does this jug differ from something animate?” He drew it back out of reach. “By organization! Exactly! This jug is an absolute democracy of atoms. It has importance, or thereness, so to speak, but no Expression, or, loosely, ah-ha!-ness. Importance is primarily monistic in its reference to the universe. Limited to a finite individual occasion, importance ceases to be important. In some sense or other—we can skip the details—importance is derived from the immanence of infinitude in the finite. Expression, however—listen closely now—expression is founded on the finite occasion. It is the activity of finitude impressing itself on its environment. Importance passes from the world as one to the world as many, whereas expression is the gift from the world as many to the world as one. The laws of nature are large average effects which reign impersonally. But there is nothing average about expression: it is essentially individual. Consider one definite molecule—”
    > 
    > “A what?” I said.
    > 
    > The closed eyes squeezed tight. He let out a long, cross sigh of red-orange fire.
    > 
    > “Put it this way,” he said. His voice had grown feeble, as if he were losing hope. “In the case of vegetables, we find expressive bodily organizations which lack any one center of experience with a higher complexity either of expressions received or of inborn data. Another democracy, but with qualifications, as we shall see. An animal, on the other hand, is dominated by one or more centers of experience. If the dominant activity be severed from the rest of the body—if, for example, we cut off the head—the whole coordination collapses, and the animal dies. Whereas in the case of the vegetable, the democracy can be subdivided into minor democracies which easily survive without much apparent loss of functional expression.” He paused. “You at least follow that?”
    > 
    > “I think so.”
    > 
    > He sighed. “Listen. Listen closely! An angry man does not usually shake his fist at the universe in general. He makes a selection and knocks his neighbor down. A piece of rock, on the other hand, impartially attracts the universe according to the law of gravitation. You grant there’s a difference?”
    > 
    > He waited, furious with impatience. I met his eye as long as I could, then shook my head. It was unfair. For all I knew he might be telling me gibberish on purpose. I sat down. Let him babble. Let him burn me alive. The hell with it.
    > 
    > After a long, long time, he said, “It was stupid of you to come.”
    > 
    > I nodded, sulking.
    > 
    > He stretched his wings—it was like a huge, irascible yawn—then settled again. “Things come and go,” he said. “That’s the gist of it. In a billion billion billion years, everything will have come and gone several times, in various forms. Even I will be gone. A certain man will absurdly kill me. A terrible pity—loss of a remarkable form of life. Conservationists will howl.” He chuckled. “Meaningless, however. These jugs and pebbles, everything, these too will go. Poof! Boobies, hemorrhoids, boils, slaver …”
    > 
    > “You don’t know that!” I said.
    > 
    > He smiled, showing all his teeth, and I knew he knew it.
    > 
    > “A swirl in the stream of time. A temporary gathering of bits, a few random dust specks, so to speak—pure metaphor, you understand—then by chance a vast floating cloud of dustspecks, an expanding universe—” He shrugged. “Complexities: green dust as well as the regular kind. Purple dust. Gold. Additional refinements: sensitive dust, copulating dust, worshipful dust!” He laughed, hollow as the cavern around him. “New laws for each new form, of course. New lines of potential. Complexity beyond complexity, accident on accident, until—” His leer was like icy wind.
    > 
    > “Go on,” I said.
    > 
    > He closed his eyes, still smiling. “Pick an apocalypse, any apocalypse. A sea of black oil and dead things. No wind. No light. Nothing stirring, not even an ant, a spider. A silent universe. Such is the end of the flicker of time, the brief, hot fuse of events and ideas set off, accidentally, and snuffed out, accidentally, by man. Not a real ending of course, nor even a beginning. Mere ripple in Time’s stream.”
    > 
    > ...
    > 
    > “You said ‘Fiddlesticks,’” I said. “Why is it fiddlesticks if I stop giving people heart attacks over nothing? Why shouldn’t one change one’s ways, improve one’s character?” I must have been an interesting sight, that instant, big shaggy monster intense and earnest, bent like a priest at his prayers.
    > 
    > ...
    > 
    > The dragon tipped up his great tusked head, stretched his neck, sighed fire. “Ah, Grendel!” he said. He seemed that instant almost to rise to pity. “You improve them, my boy! Can’t you see that yourself? You stimulate them! You make them think and scheme. You drive them to poetry, science, religion, all that makes them what they are for as long as they last. You are, so to speak, the brute existent by which they learn to define themselves. The exile, captivity, death they shrink from—the blunt facts of their mortality, their abandonment—that’s what you make them recognize, embrace! You are mankind, or man’s condition: inseparable as the mountain-climber and the mountain. If you withdraw, you’ll instantly be replaced. Brute existents, you know, are a dime a dozen. No sentimental trash, then. If man’s the irrelevance that interests you, stick with him! Scare him to glory! It’s all the same in the end, matter and motion, simple or complex. No difference, finally. Death, transfiguration. Ashes to ashes and slime to slime, amen.”

    The novel really wrestles with your question, though I think to properly wrestle with the question means the conclusion isn't that clear-cut.

    Girls Last Tour is a manga that has that. It also has an anime, but it doesn't cover the whole manga.
