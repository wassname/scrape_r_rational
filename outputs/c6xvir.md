## [RT][DC] Legacy of the Goddess: A Rational Zelda Quest - Chapter 1: A Blight Upon the Realm

### Post:

[Chapter 1: A Blight Upon the Realm](https://chaossnek.com/Story?chapter=C1) ~5k words.

It begins! A little more action-y than I had planned. I hope that doesn't drive away potential readers. I'm still getting the hang of this whole writing thing, so bear with me while I work out the kinks.

SV thread can be found [here](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/legacy-of-the-goddess-a-rational-zelda-quest.55903/). If you want to follow the story, I recommend either participating in the quest directly or subscribing to updates on my website.

(I can assure you that the subscription feature has definitely been there the whole time and that I definitely didn't just add it.)

Hope you enjoy. Come drop by the thread and say hi!

  Not to try to tell you what to do, but wouldn't it make more sense to include the prologue chapters in your SV thread *before* chapter 1 rather than have a very easy to miss link to them after it? Either way your story's been pretty great so I'm looking forward to following along!

    /u/-vecht- : I very strongly second this. At the very least move the prologue links to the top of the first post.
    ```

    ```
    They will be posted to SV in the coming days. It says so in the infopost.

  How do I subscribe for updates?
  ```

  - u/-Vecht-:
    ```
    Just register an account and select the subscription option. If you've already registered, it's under "Update Preferences" on the top right.
    ```

  ```
  I've never followed a quest before, but I like zelda and this seems well written so far, so I'll give it a shot.
