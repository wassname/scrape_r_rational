## Demiurge Chess, a translation of Bormor

### Post:

Original source: https://bormor.livejournal.com/267598.html

The following is my translation from Russian to English.

Demiurge Mazukta set the board, placed the pieces, and took a die in his hand. "So, let's begin?"
"Let's begin!" eagerly agreed demiurge Shambambukli, "throw the die".

Mazukta threw the die and let out a self-satisfied chuckle. "Yes! I play as the whites, and you play as the blacks."

"Aw damn it", replied saddened Shambambukli. "I also want to play as whites."

"Oh really?"  Mazukta burst into laughter. "Good must be strong. Here!" He curled his hand into a fist. "You don't even have proper fists. And, after all, the die decided, so play as the world evil."

"Oh well", agreed Shambambukli. "So, those pieces are mine? Thieves, murderers, rapists, and others?"

"Yes, while mine are priests, judges, teachers, doctors, and politicians. Let's begin!"

The demiurges simultaneously leaned over the table and begun thoughtfully moving their pieces.

"Stop!" interjected Mazukta after some time. "How are you playing?"

"What about it?"

"That bastard over here - what is he doing with a grandmother?"

"Helping her cross the road."

"Are you insane? He's a rapist! An awful person."

"And awful people can't help others cross the road?"

"They can't!"

"Why not?"

Mazukta paused to think. "They can't, and that's all there is to it. It's a good deed and you're playing as evil."

"Wait a minute", Shambambukli raised a hand, "if my pieces only commit evil deeds, noone will love them."

"But of course! People are supposed to be afraid of them, not love them!"

"No", Shambambukli shook his head, "I don't agree that way. If noone wants to associate with my pieces, everyone will jump side to whites, and I lose."

"Then why don't I ever lose as evil?" parried Mazukta.

"I don't know, what am I doing wrong?"

"You're doing everything wrong! Your spies prevent wars, bandits steal from the rich and give to the poor, rapists... those only act with love and consent! I, of course, understand that ends justify the means, but not *these* sort of means!"

"Let's change places then", offered Shambambukli, "if you know everything so well, you can play as blacks and I will play as whites."

"Okay, let's change places, just let me get you up to speed what I've done so far as whites. Look, here's inquisition - it prevents pieces from switching to evil. Here's the holy warrior order, which is tasked with converting blacks to white faith. This here is the education system, designed to destroy any wrong thoughts at the root, so that people can't even think about changing sides. And these are concentration camps, where I send irreparable elements. After all, you can't burn everyone at the stake, right? Anyway, you now go play as whites, and I will be fixing what you ruined so far as blacks."

"Yeah..." Shambambukli swallowed, "there's indeed a lot of fixing to do..."

  If people liked this, I could translate other bormor stories in the future.

    Yeah, this was great and hysterically funny. Really hammers in the idea that one person's idea of good and evil will be different from another person's.

      Bormor is generally extremely good.

    If people want more, I did a whole bunch [here](https://toothycat.livejournal.com/tag/bormor) a while back. Also some [here](https://www.toothycat.net/wiki/wiki.pl?search=bormor&search_ww=1)

      Great! You should post it on the sub for visibility

        Well, it's only about a third demiurge ones. The others aren't particularly rational, just fun little vignettes on traditional fairytales.

  The Demiurge series is one of the best rational short story series from RuLJ (up there with [mytholozhkis about Achiless&Tortoise](https://vetertann.livejournal.com/204661.html).

  I'll be watching this with great interest

  I took the liberty of editing it a bit, as a native English speaker.  I hope you don't mind.

  ~~There's a bit of dialogue missing because I didn't understand its purpose.  It's marked in [__bold and brackets__].~~  Thanks /u/sl236 for the explanation.

  Yay to Bormor, the Unkind Storyteller!

  Seriously, his stores are great. Btw, there has already been at least one of those posted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4t253z/dc_the_parable_of_the_dark_lord/
