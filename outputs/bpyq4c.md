## I think I just found an Ender's Game reference in r!Animorphs

Ansible? :o

  Not necessarily Ender's Game. Ansible was coined by Ursula K. LeGuin in 1966, and has been used in multiple works. It's just a science fiction term for 'FTL communication device'.

      He's not.  People just love to outrage monger and pick on easy targets.

      He *is* opposed to gay marriage and gay sex, but because he takes his religion seriously as opposed to because of hate or fear.

      If you read the words he's actually said and written as opposed to people's furious, exaggerated misinterpretations, the situation is a lot more mundane.
      ```

        If you read his actual words, I'm not sure how you can find them to be anything but repugnant, unless you also conform to that viewpoint. Just because they're dressed in religious arguments doesn't make them any less offensive.

          (2/2)

          The problem at the root of all this (I hypothesize wildly) is that most of the people hearing his words "from the outside" (e.g. most agnostic liberals, most LGBTQ people, etc.) don't actually have, or aren't booting up and actively using, their "genuinely faithful human" module.

          They're looking at his words, and then squinting at *themselves* and thinking, "what kinds of things would *I* have to be feeling, right this second, to produce sentences like this?"

          And then they're concluding "oh, like—barely disguised hate or disgust, or something.  Like, if I was feeling a whole bunch of really strong revulsion or bigotry, but knew I'd be attacked for expressing it, I might try dressing it up real nice, like this, to make it defensible and get away with it."

          And yep, that's true—that's a thing humans do.

          But if you look at *all of OSC's other behavior,* including all of his writing (both fiction and political), it's *much more consistent* and *much simpler* to posit:

          "Oh!  He's just got ... a lot more faith than I've ever had.  Like, he's taking his religion unusually seriously, and unusually logically, and so even though he's naturally an empathetic and understanding person (as you can see in all of his fiction) he's sort of forced himself to draw a line in the sand here, and is holding that line sincerely and in good faith, despite the fact that it's causing him to *keep company with assholes.*"

          The people who want to tear him down *don't want to admit that he might just be sincere about his religion.*  Which makes it much harder to *actually fix him,* since he's already got to have shields up and knives out against attacks that really are unjustified and unfair and based on wildly wrong assumptions.  It would be much easier to engage with and convince people like him if the most zealous of his opponents fought *what's actually there* instead of fighting the strawman they've invented.

            I can't speak for anyone else but I remember reading and enjoying his works back in the day and going on his website to search for more and to learn about this author that I admired. I think the most disappointing part of finding his musings on religion and the like was how well he writes mostly-rational characters. How can there be such a disconnect in his own personal life?

            It's interesting that there's a few Mormon authors and artists that produce works untinged by the religious perspective I see from other authors.

            As a gay guy who was raised in a christian conservative setting, and as fan of both Ender's Game and r!Animorphs, I feel like I should say something...

            &#x200B;

            I *mostly* endorse /u/TK17Studios's previous comments here. Too few people are trying to genuinely pass the ideological turing test for the religious perspective. I've had enough experience with religion that I can put myself in OSC's shoes and see how his perspective follows reasonably from his worldview, and is not based in his own personal hate or disgust. I can't hate OSC, or anyone, for trying in good faith to discern what is right to the best of this abilities. I even have a friend who is a devout christian and is opposed to gay relationships because of his religion. He is one of the nicest people I have ever met; he has no problems hanging out with me, and I've talked to him directly about LGBT issues on several occasions (he is personally opposed, but never judges me and doesn't think the government should have any say in it). As a general rule, if so-called "homophobes" are willing to be friends with me, then I'm willing to be friends with them. Personal kindness is a very effective means of changing minds.

            &#x200B;

            But about that word, "homophobia." Although it contains the suffix "phobia," as far as I can tell everyone now understands it to generally mean "opposed to same-sex relationships." Yes, it has an extra derogatory connotation, something like "oh, so you think gay people should be beaten to death, huh?" But I think it's *supposed* to have that connotation. In some sense, the overt motte-and-bailey is entirely the point of the word. OSC may not support violence, but his views are only one or two steps away from policies that do enact violence, such as gay conversion therapy. So is OSC "homophobic?" I still hesitate to use that word against individual people, for exactly the reasons TK17 said above; I think it's better to say that the *religion itself* is homophobic. But sometimes words are strategic rather than truthful - if no one had ever accused OSC of being homophobic, would he have bothered to make such a strong attempt to clarify his position? Sometimes the best way to coax out the truth is to first say something wrong. (I have no thesis that I'm building towards here - I'm just thinking out loud).

            &#x200B;

            And about that essay linked above - it is indeed hurtful, not only for what it says, but how it is said. The language is distancing, clinical, diagnostic - being "homosexual" (a cold, detached, academic word that I have always hated) is a defect, a sin, a "lifestyle," and if you follow it you'll never be happy, et cetera. I grew up surrounded by this rhetoric, and my resulting mental health was... not good. Do you know what the worst part about these arguments is, to someone growing up with them? It's not that they are mean, or that they inspire violence and oppression. Personally, I can deal with meanness and violence, if I am whole inside. No, worst part is that they sound so reasonable. They set your mind at war with itself. If you don't yet have the intellectual skills to combat them, then you start to think they are true. Those are the worst insults, the ones you fear to be true.

            &#x200B;

            (So I guess there I'm agreeing with TK17, because attacking strawmen doesn't do anyone a favor, especially those, who, like me, were desperate to find genuinely good counterarguments to anti-gay rhetoric instead of hollow virtue-signalling... but honestly I *did* also appreciate the virtue-signalling, because it was nice to know that some people would support me unconditionally... again, I have no thesis and I'm just thinking out loud).

              Hey, thanks for the additional input. I honestly can't decide if I'm for or against the kind of mental compartmentalization you're talking about – it's a little weird to me that a) someone would be able to genuinely believe that gays are bad for society but still want to be friends with you (and *not* try to proselytize) and b) that you would want to be friends with someone who thinks you and others like you are delusional, ripping apart the fabric of good family values, etc. But. If you're fine with it, I guess I can't really say anything? That's your choice.

              I do just want to say, though, that you need to be reeallly careful about not falling into the same trap you're accusing others of:

              >I can't hate OSC, or anyone, for trying in good faith[...]

              >attacking strawmen doesn't do anyone a favor[...]

              Nobody in this thread said they hated OSC. They called him a raging homophobe and a cunt, further down the thread. Now maybe I'm getting real close to playing semantics, here, but you're putting words in other people's mouths (this motte-bailey thing) when you're saying we *hate him*. (Maybe others do, but personally I just feel disappointed and sad. I think his views are hurtful and disgusting, but I don't hate the guy.)
              ```

              - u/LieGroupE8:
                ```
                I didn't mean to imply that you all hate him. I just meant to say that I don't hate him. (I don't particularly like him, either, and I agree that his views are harmful).

                Being friends with that person is a bit strange, to be honest, but the gay thing almost never comes up. And I imagine it feels like weird compartmentalization for him, too, being friends with someone who his religion says is an unrepentant sinner. But we like each other in every other way. I enjoy his company enough that I don't want to push him away just for that. I think I may have softened his views over time as well.
                ```

        - u/TK17Studios:

          I've read it before, and just reread it.  It's not repugnant in the least.

          > I predicted toward the beginning of the preceding essay that those who have already accepted the dogmas of the homosexual community as a source of truth superior to the words of the prophets would be incapable of reading what I had actually written here and would instead interpret my words as intolerance, oppression, gay-bashing, or, an epithet used now without a shred of its original meaning, "homophobia." My prediction was exactly fulfilled, and I have had ample opportunity to observe that some supposed proponents of liberty for homosexuals do not believe in freedom of speech for anyone who disagrees with them.

          That comes *after* 1800 words in which his message, repeated and clarified in detail, is this:

          - Everybody sins; we all need rules and communities to help us grow to do better
          - According to the LDS, homosexual behavior is a sin
          - If you do it a little, as a Mormon, you should be met with compassionate but firm correction and support
          - If you do it a lot, endorsedly, you're not really a Mormon anymore

          ... that's straightforwardly logical, and sensible, and contains no fear or hatred except for the fundamental disapproval of *all sexual misconduct, homosexuality no more or less than adultery.*

          -------------------------------------------------------------------------

          For the record: I'm a cis male atheist who has had sex with eight men in his life so far, counting back to the year 2003 (one of those is an ongoing, decade-plus-long relationship).

          What you're taking offense at is his *declaration that homosexual behavior is itself sinful.*  That's fine—I also think that's a backwards, misguided, uncompassionate, and unjustified position!

          But *if you take his religious professions seriously,* then you will see that he's doing the bare minimum required to be *actually consistent.*  He's not advocating for anything other than what *you yourself* **ought** *to advocate, if you believe that homosexual activity will damn someone's soul to eternal torment.*

          He's *absolutely correct* that if you advocate for the acceptance of homosexual behavior, you're not really a Mormon anymore, but some kind of diluted Mormon-prime.  He's no less correct than someone who points out that advocates for birth control aren't really Catholic anymore, but some kind of diluted Catholic-prime.

          I think the correct attack here is "Mormonism is inherently vile," not "Orson Scott Card is a raging homophobe."  Orson Scott Card has a wrong belief down at the root of his behavior, but it's not hatred of gay people.  It's faith in the Mormon interpretation of the Judeo-Christian tradition.

            Yes, his religion is homophobic and since he follows it's tenets so is he. I'm not sure why you're excusing his beliefs just because they're sourced from religion. 

             But beyond that, what I found egregious were his rationalizations and... infantilising of those who engage, unrepentantly, in gay sex. He has no flexibility in his viewpoints.

             >The average fifteen-year-old teenage boy is genetically predisposed to copulate with anything that moves. We are compassionate and forgiving of those who cannot resist this temptation, but we do not regard as adult anyone who has not overcome it;

            >the Church has no room for those who, instead of repenting of homosexuality, wish it to become an acceptable behavior in the society of the Saints. They are wolves in sheep's clothing, preaching meekness while attempting to devour the flock.

            >What we do with small children is to establish clear boundaries and offer swift but mild punishment for crossing them.
            ```

            - u/TK17Studios:
              ```
              I'm not excusing them, per se.  I reiterate (since I did already say it, above, explicitly) that I think his viewpoints are wrongheaded and uncompassionate and unjustified.

              What I'm doing is saying *they're not based in hatred or fear,* or at least not in him personally (obvs their *origin* is from xenophobic frightened desert nomads trying to acquire some modicum of control in a world full of things that are trying to kill them).  And that—while you might argue that *any* arguments against homosexuality end up emboldening and supporting hatred and fear, since there IS a lot of hatred and fear in that crowd—OSC's arguments in particular **explicitly** delegitimize hate, violence, rejection, etc.  The worst he says is "if you do this and keep doing it, **you shouldn't consider yourself a member of this church, which has rules against exactly that, anymore.**"

              I think that's fair play.  I think his church is welcome to dry up and die for lack of membership as the rest of the world moves past it.  I think it's *also* nice for people who grew up Mormon to try to get the Mormon church to change from the inside.

              But *as the rules of Mormonism stand right now,* it's silly to pretend that his position is hateful and fearful when it's clearly just *a logical extrapolation of his religious beliefs.*

              Again, I'm not excusing those.  I'm *diagnosing* them.  I'm saying that if you come at him with attacks designed to combat hatred and fear, you're going to miss the target and be ineffective (and make yourself look silly, to boot).  Attack the real root of the real problem, don't round your enemies off to the most convenient strawman.

              (And what I mean by "rounding off" is stuff like "he has no flexibility in his viewpoints" when the sentence he wrote was a *true sentence* about the *average* fifteen-year-old.  Have you worked extensively with fifteen-year-olds?  I have.  The *average* fifteen-year-old boy is well-described by that sentence, in my experience, for all that I've known literally dozens of boys who were better than that.  C'mon, this is r/rational, specific words should matter here.)

                It sounds like you're interpreting people calling him homophobic to mean he is afraid and/or angry towards gays. Colloquially, homophobia or calling someone homophobic means that they are against same sex relationships. The cause of that aversion actually usually based in disgust, in my experience. 

                Personally speaking, I find the arguments that he's using particularly hurtful - for the reasons mentioned above. (On the 15yo comment, I'm taking it in the context he puts it, that homosexuality is some kind of derelicton in restraining ones hormone-laden impulses.)
                ```

                - u/TK17Studios:
                  ```
                  The problem is, "homophobia" is a **textbook** example of a motte-and-bailey argument.

                  Like, sure, you're ~~now falling back to say~~ saying "but all I mean is that he's opposed to same-sex relationships."  But if I hadn't stepped in to object to the guy above, the *implication* and *connotation* and *takeaway impression* of the label "homophobe" (especially with the word "raging" attached) would have been something *much* more sinister.

                  If all you meant to say is "OSC is clearly opposed to same sex relationships," then I am 100% in agreement with you; that's a demonstrable fact, and not really open to opinion.

                  If you further wanted to add "... and I think that's dumb/wrong/bad," I'm at least *mostly* with you, and maybe completely, depending on the details.

                  What I'm objecting to is the bailey-use of the term, where we all agree "okay, he's a homophobe" using the definition "against same-sex relationships," but then later on people go and socially beat him up for being full of hatred or fear or for being personally and fundamentally bigoted and motivated by disgust and being the same sort of person who beats gay men to death in back alleys with socks full of gravel, because *they* include *that* in the definition, and we've given them license to put OSC in that same bucket.

                    I'm not familiar with that argument, I'll have to look it up.

                    I am not walking back my stance at all, I think we're just clarifying what we meant. The original statement was that Card is a raging homophobe. I agree with that because I took that to mean he's a) against gay relationships and b) passionately so.

                    I further went on to say that his arguments are repugnant because you seemed to disagree with the b) part of that statement.

                    I'm honestly don't understand how you can read that article and not be disgusted with the way he's marginalizing the feelings of those who believe differently from him. It's very different to say, "I don't agree with your actions and hope you change your ways” vs "you're only acting this way because you were never taught better or raised correctly. Because you're acting on your base instincts. Because *my view is more correct than yours*"
                    ```

                    - u/TK17Studios:
                      ```
                      I ... sort of? ... disagree with b)

                      I think he's passionate, but I think the *root* of the passion is something like *desire for humans not to suffer in hell.*  Like, I really genuinely believe that the root of his passion is *compassion,* and thus "raging" is inexcusably misleading (like those posts that insist on humanizing Hitler, because *if we forget Hitler was human, and think of him only as a cackling caricatured monster, we'll fail to recognize the next Hitler)*.

                      Which makes this all the more tragic.  I think OSC is looking at humans like a doctor, and being like, "what could possibly cause us to be this way, to each other and to ourselves?" and he's decided to blame it all on biology and man's fundamentally flawed nature (because that's what he was told, over and over again his whole life).

                      And so you have someone who a) wants the world to be good, b) thinks he knows what's bad, c) thinks he knows *why* what he thinks is bad, is bad, and d) is trying to get that message across with the absolute minimum of trespass, but *thinks the minimum trespass still requires telling people that their sexual behavior is wrong.*

                      That's ... tragic.  Imagine living that life.  Oof.

                      I don't think his passion comes from innate revulsion.  I think it comes from ... well, *because he was never taught better or raised correctly,* ironically enough.

                      The reason I keep drawing this line is because of something like, I find myself imagining that I'm back in the classroom, teaching again, and I've got two eleven-year-old boys in front of me who are fighting, and like, sure, on the object, policy level I'm on the side of the kid with two dads, I'm *glad* that OSC and the Mormons are losing the culture wars, but I *also* care about and want the best for the kid who was raised by fundamentalists, and ... idk.  

                      If it were *just* the kid with two dads in the room, I'd have no problem saying words like "everything he told you is wrong, I'm sorry you had to hear that, I'm definitely going to make him sit out at recess for saying it, that kind of talk isn't tolerated in this classroom, period."

                      But it feels (in my head) like both kids are in the room at the same time, and so I'm trying to pull *both* of them onto the middle ground, and honestly right now "the gay agenda" is winning in polite Western society, and that's great, and so where in 1990 I would've been faster to step to the defense of the kid with two dads, now in 2019 I feel like I'm constantly running around saying "do you see how what you said isn't actually fair, though?"

                      (Less to you and more to the first guy.)

                      If I can't treat the fundamentalist kid with true compassion, if I can't pass his ideological Turing test, if I can't speak to the *true roots* of his belief, then I can't save him, too.  And I want to save him just as much as I want to save the kid with two dads, just as much as I want to save *everybody.*  To the kid that's like, "why's he such an *asshole,* though?" I feel like I want to have a truer answer than "i kno, rite??"

                      "i kno, rite" is easy, but it's ultimately no less destructive.  It's just writing off a different set of people.

                        Ok. I get where you're coming from. I too look at alternative viewpoints when I hear an argument or a statement (much to the detriment of my relationships, as  it usually comes across as arguing when they just want support or validation).

                        But the takeaway in this case, for me, is that words and actions have consequences. Just because I understand *why* someone might say something hurtful doesn't make it any less so. 

                        I'm not going to go into a huge tangent, but my beef with religions is that they usually crush critical thinking (or perhaps it might be more fair to say that they take advantage of people's intellectual laziness). This seems like another case of that - his religious leaders say being gay is bad, therefore it is. And all of his arguments must necessarily circle back around to that. 

                        Now that I think about it some more and as I'm internalizing some of what you're saying, I think that beacuse this piece is meant for his brethren, because he is arguing for leniency, it's exposing the things we don't usually hear (the rationalizations for being gay). What I'm getting at is that maybe because he's an otherwise rational thinker who is forced by his religion to have a certain viewpoint, he can't just say "gay is bad, don't do it" but must come up with reasons. As someone who disagrees, it's much harder to shrug off rationalizations and arguments apathetically than it is to just disagree.

                        I feel like I have to object to this metaphor, because there's a huge difference between a child who has fundamentalist parents and a grown man who has known many gay people and still holds these beliefs. There's some hope that you can convince such a child that there's more to the issue than what they've been told, but after decades of holding such a position the idea that by being nice to OSC you'll convince him otherwise seems laughable.

                        At the root of this problem is that no matter how polite he may be, he's still a voting adult; he and people like him will vote for politicians who want to stop gay relationships, extramarital sex of all kinds, divorces, etc...

                        This means that no matter how polite he may be when saying these things, he's still in some sense an enemy, because politicians with similar leanings will try to make laws preventing these things in other people for what they think is their own good. It's too much to hope that OSC can be convinced at this point, so the difference between him and someone who hates gay people on an emotional level is pretty much academic except for the possibility of actually going out and beating someone up. Sure, it might be better if such people were more like OSC, but even if they were all magically changed overnight, the result would still be widespread support for anti-gay laws and government policies. 

                        (And no, despite his claims, not thinking gay marriage should be recognized is still anti-gay.)

                          Yeah, but take a minute to think about the game theoretic/decision theoretic ramifications of your stance...

                      https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/social-justice-and-words-words-words/ is a good source for learning about motte-and-bailey.

                      Also: thanks for engaging in good faith generally?  This has felt like a productive back-and-forth on my end.

        'He is opposed to' is a rather mild way of saying 'he has donated money towards efforts to make illegal'. I can understand readers being appalled at finding out some of the money they spent on buying his books was then used by him to attempt to prevent gay people being able to marry.

  It's a pretty common word in sci-fi, but the author of r!animorphs is an incorrigible fan of Ender's Game so I wouldn't be surprised if that's where he encountered the word.

    also since "ansible" is effectively the word for "FTL communications device", I wouldn't be surprised at all if it's used in the original fiction.
