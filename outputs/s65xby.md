## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  If you've ever wanted to read a short story about a Worm murder mystery made in the style of an old 80's detective serial, then I highly recommend [Just One More Thing Mr.Anders... (Worm/Columbo)](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/just-one-more-thing-mr-anders-worm-columbo-complete.987646/)

  Columbo always had a distinct style as a detective serial, and this story captures it perfectly, you can practically hear Peter Falk doing his iconic performance as Lt. Columbo when reading this, and it's so much fun.

  If you'd like an example of what the Columbo style is like, I'd recommend watching [this clip](https://youtu.be/qHhXZjUCB1c?t=225), but the basics are that they're murder mysteries from the perspective of the culprit, you see all the details as the culprit makes the 'perfect crime' and the mystery is in trying to figure out how the seemingly bumbling detective Columbo will even notice that something is wrong, much less prove who did it.

  A large majority of isekai stories take place in magic/fantasy settings, due to the overlap with litrpg themes.

  For a change, I'm looking for rational/rational adjacent isekai stories trapped in an otherworldly anomalous/paranormal setting. Not necessarily horror, but maybe unsettling in an uncannily familiar way.

  Think something like stepping into the [infinite IKEA of SCP-3008](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3008) and getting trapped, or accidentally noclipping into [The Backrooms](https://youtu.be/H4dGpz6cnHo). Falling through a one way portal into some non-euclidean pocket dimension, wandering lost through an endless library of eldritch books, finding yourself stuck in the [great plane of garbage](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4jzc06/biweekly_challenge_plane_of_garbage/), travelling The Long Stairs from WTC. That sort of thing.

  Stuff I've already read/reading with similar themes: 

  - [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/29358/dungeon-crawler-carl-book-5-the-hunting-grounds)  
  - [The Daily Grind](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/15925/the-daily-grind) 
  - [u/M59GAR multiverse](http://forest.wolfnexus.net/wiki/index.php/Multiverse_unofficial_reading_guide)  
  - Various shorts from SCP wiki with this theme (another good one is [SCP-3333](https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3333))
  ```

  - u/BavarianBarbarian_:
    ```
    The entire Practise of [Finding](https://pact-web-serial.fandom.com/wiki/Finder) from Wildbow's Otherverse setting focuses on accessing and exploiting strange realms grouped under the term "the Paths". They are usually small-ish, more or less linear dimensions accessed through random rituals, and obey quite unpredictable internal logic. In one realm, you're not allowed to look at the ground; in another, you can only move while the giant clock is ticking. Making it through a Path usually gives you one or more from a set of different boons, which can range from minor (occasionally finding pocket change in your clothes) to really quite powerful, like magic items that allow for teleportation.  
    Without spoiling too much, that Practise and some of its assorted realms are a focus of [Pale](https://palewebserial.wordpress.com/about/), but if you only want to read some spoiler-free Path descriptions, here's one for the [Forest Ribbon Trail](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ti2MftECN9PloDlHdjTGlMbwXPxf0GGOyNl-c4OYKCs/edit), and one for [Falling Oak Avenue](https://old.reddit.com/r/Parahumans/comments/hp8xmw/pale_reflections_stolen_away_4/fy8jyl6/).

    Could someone give a pitch for this? I went to the wiki and it sounds *interesting* but I couldn't find anything that actually described what it is.
    ```

    - u/fish312:
      ```
      It's a series of anthological short stories written by u/m59gar in r/nosleep circa 2015 that explore (fictional) excursions into anomalous places, e.g. a cave that makes an identical copy of anybody who walks through it. Or a door to a parallel post apocalyptic reality where everything is covered in a toxic moss. Or a world covered in supernatural darkness.

      Basically SCP before the SCP universe became a thing, but written from a first person exploration perspective through a series of reddit posts. They eventually tie everything together into a unified multiverse.

          Scp was a thing but not quite in the current state as a coherent universe, more like a bunch of random spooky tales. I remember series 3xxx starting in 2016, so there must've only been 1 and 2 before then

    Ok, I don't have an answer for you, but that Backrooms video has 5.9M views & was apparently uploaded 10 days ago. Am I missing something, or is there a way to hack the upload date? Is it actually that new & just blew up really fast?

    EDIT: Just watched, that was great. I would love to know what that building was originally used for, how they altered it for the shoot, what special effects they used, etc.
    ```

    - u/fish312:
      ```
      The backrooms as a concept has been around for quite a while but that video is new, and probably the best interpretation I've seen so far. If I'm not mistaken, the entire video is CGI.

      Would love to read a novel set in such a universe.

  - u/Revlar:
    ```
    Sonny Boy might fit the bill. It's an anime from last year, complete at 12 episodes. Not particularly rational but an interesting execution of a weird isekai concept. Some people consider it to be pure nonsense but I got a kick out of it and the music is stellar (though you won't hear any of it until the end of the first episode). The first episode starts in media res, with a school building suspended over nothing in a black void and every student of one middle school class in their final year living in it.

    It owes a lot to Drifting Classroom, an old award-winning manga with a similar school-wide isekai-into-nothing, but Drifting Classroom seasons its weirdness with a lot of dark shit. Still worth a read, but Sonny Boy beats it in my estimation.
    ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Maybe An Outcast in Another World? It's litrpg, but the setting is pretty uncanny and artificial (in a good way). It's not that rational though, the protagonist is mostly an emotional guy, and while there's munchkining it takes a backseat to the lore of the world. 

    There's [Meet the Freak](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38100/meet-the-freak), where the isekai is to a world with very different weather and geology, as well as other characters being isekaid as well. I didn't enjoy the protagonist too much, but he does act pretty rationally overall.

  Recent-ish works on RoyalRoad I liked enough to sub to their Patreon this year (in no particular order):

  * [Apocalypse Parenting](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/47434/apocalypse-parenting). System Apocalypse with an interesting premise (the MC is a stay-at-home mom with children rather than some kind of a typical for the genre loner unburdened by "friends" or family). It makes sure to deliver on that premise as well—characters and their struggles feel very real. It's somewhat of a slow burn, but not super slow. 100k words in, characters are still in the "starting location" of sorts, but there was significant progress both in terms of the LitRPG stuff and interpersonal relationships. It actually reminds me a lot of *Dungeon Crawler Carl*, but the protagonist is completely different, and the story is much less of a biting satire. Also, I really like the prose here compared to the sad norm of amateur RR works.

  * [Hive Minds Give Good Hugs](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/45048/hive-minds-give-good-hugs). It's from the same author as the oft-recommended here *Vigor Mortis*. The MC is sorta-isekai'd (explaining it further would spoil the plot) into a body that can create her own hive mind and tries to survive on an extremely hostile alien planet. Features a lot of realistic biology, interesting ideas, and unhealthy amount of creepy adorableness; the one issue I have here is similar to Vigor Mortis—the protagonist is super overpowered, and the tension is mostly due to the world being very unkind to her; she's still leagues above anything or anyone around her.

  * [Paranoid Mage](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49879/paranoid-mage). From the same author as *Blue Core*, but, fortunately for me, with absolutely no sex (both so far and on the horizon as I've read ten chapters ahead on Patreon). I don't really want to spoil the plot by going into the detail, but it was best described by one of the reviewers: "Was expecting a 'defy the heavens' sort of MC when I read the description. Oh no, this is so much better. With a little bit of luck, a healthy amount of paranoia, and an american amount of distrust for the government, this MC is an absolute champ so far." It's competency porn, pure and simple—both characters and worldbuilding are rather bland, but they are take the back seat to intelligent plans and careful experimentations. If you liked parts of HPMoR and MoL where the protagonists munchkined the heck out of magic, you would very likely enjoy this as well.

    As to Paranoid Mage, do you feel as though you're missing something? I shelled out a bit to read ahead myself, and >!even with his conversations with Hargrave, the specifics of destroying five vampire nests makes me wonder what 'special advantage' he's got.!<

    I'm also a bit concerned about the world building. It's very well done, in that an ignorant MC can keep the audience ignorant, but it seems like we're missing something there that prevents him from being found. And not just in the purely magical sense, but the technological sense as well - the methods they used for technological tracking seemed to boil down to "eh, oh well". Maybe it's cultural. I'm just worried that what we're missing is that he's a proper mary sue with a rational glaze rather than reasonable MC with a mary sue glaze. Some of that is "Is he worth the investment", but if >!Duvall really is the prime space archmage who sells most Houses their bits and pieces, as of the 17 update, you'd think she would mobilize a few things to find on her long awaited apprentice.!< Again, though, maybe that's just something we haven't seen yet. It just loops back to feeling like I've missed something important, and that there isn't even a hint of that in the text so far that I can see.

      **Spoilers through CH 17 below**, so unless you're willing to burn $10 on these chapters or wait 5 weeks for it to catch up, don't read them. 

      I think for me, I wanted to see him act much much more like he does in chapters 1 and 2. There's a ton of paranoia, planning, and a magical+urban escapism/**hunt** that just got the blood flowing. There was so much fear, as you point out because the MC is ignorant, we are too. 

      >!I think I liked that he was easily outsmarting these people who are out of touch with our world. Things like paying cash and getting some fucking farmers to fly him in random directions, that's brilliant. Going out a window, when the incompetent mage/protocols only call for warding the doors. It was a Pureblood from HP vibe, where he was able to get away rather easily but in a way that was interesting to read.!<

      My biggest issue is there's constantly things that chapter 1 Callum would **never** do. 

      >!1. Going in a straight line south and stopping at every single magical bookstore.!<

      >!2. Knocking off the first den was a bit too murderhobo for me. He does it, and rationalizes it to himself (by saying they were eating people/kidnappers), then later he goes through an entire scouting mission/5 minutes before the start of his next murder spree, he googles to check that they're actually bad news.!<

      >!3. leaving his vortex beads/screws literally everywhere he's been. He should have checked if the beads work underground, then he should be burying them if they do. He wouldn't know that an earth mage could easily find them until after he saw the earth mage in his attack, but that's what paranoia is.!<

      >!4. Sending the message about Clara, he later talks about "dropping" identities and not going back to them, but it's not something he would have ever done in CH 1. He was much more ruthless.!<

      >!5. Using the same vehicles for so long on the run. He's a teleporter who switched both means (air vs ground) and multiple vehicles in the first few chapters. But for the entirety of the Patreon chapters he's in this big fuck-off RV.!<


      >!As for what's missing the vibe I get is that he's obviously a powerhouse of a mage. Lots of in text qualifiers about how he's "pretty sure" that other mages do it better, do it for longer, whatever. Lots of downplaying. Which is totally fine, because that fits with his early paranoia. He's obviously going to get caught, or get in a fight, and it's not going to be pretty for the GAR agents.!<


      >!But scenes like him overpowering the tattoo, or him intuiting the vortex beads to hide his magic, or fencing the "obviously special" gold plates with no consequences (yet). They're a bit too "Mary Sue in a rational glaze". Another great example of extreme paranoia; his parents obviously moved to a town with an active or potentially active gravehound to cover up who they are. That is a level of planning and paranoia that the early chapters mimicked.!<

      Overall I can easily see why the first 7 chapters have landed this story at the top of RR's rising stars. The author is easily able to inject fear and paranoia into his writing, which seems to be the point based on the title :). 

      I have no comments about the grammar or technical quality of the writing. I didn't notice anything egregious, but that's not saying much since I wasn't looking for it and I am known to read literal garbage. 

      It's well worth the time for readers here, despite my post kinda reading like I'm shitting on it haha. It wasn't technically *my* $10, since I used a gift card, but I still gave it up and I'm not mad I did. See also: I've just written like 350 words about it instead of working.

  This is probably the first time I've had cause to recommend something three weeks in a row, but I've hit a hot streak of amazing S-tier content lately.

  I finished watching Blue Period this week.  It's about a high-school kid who becomes fascinated with art after coming across a painting in his school's art club.  Sounds like the setting for a pretty standard coming-of-age anime, but it's executed brilliantly.  This might be one of the best anime I've seen in quite a long time.  I might be particularly inclined because I used to make art years ago, and it captures something about the nature of artistic inspiration and technique like nothing else I can remember.  It also has some very compelling, fleshed-out characters, with a lot of plot development and moments that felt very fresh.

  The Last Graduate by Naomi Novik is the sequel to A Deadly Education, which I read a couple months ago.  I thought the first was pretty good, but nothing remarkable.  This one though, I enjoyed a lot more.  I still think some of the problems with the original carry over, like the sheer oppressiveness of the setting (which may be intentional, but like - if you have a fantasy setting with magic and make it something I feel worn out over inhabiting, it detracts from the enjoyment of diving into it while reading).  But this book has something I always *love* when done right, which is pretty rare in what I've seen (and is also a spoiler for about halfway into the book), >!making the conscious choice to do good on a level that's nigh unimaginable in the setting, especially when you didn't really believe in that to begin with.!< Plus, at least the main characters are pretty well-written, with romance I'm either growing too old to not enjoy or that's executed well enough to like.

    ```

    - u/jozdien:
      ```
      I agree, kinda.  This might sound like shaky reasoning, but there's this thing that stuff I mentally label rational-adjacent like Asimov does where characters are trope-aware in subtle ways, like thinking about how a new development could lead to the fulfilment of an ancient prophecy in a way that would be apparent if you actually thought about it for a couple minutes.  Many books rely on the reader not doing that to have the book be one level above the reader at that, but Asimov (and this) make the reader's level the trope-aware one and go beyond that.  It's very refreshing to read.

  Non-fiction, but I found Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer an interesting read. It recounts the experience of a journalist training for the American Memory Championships.

  Weird "seems like a crack fic" rec that I think this subreddit will really appreciate regardless: Orochimama ([SB](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/orochimama-naruto-si.858340/#post-67916635), [RR](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/49746/orochimama)): Just prior to the start of Naruto canon, Orochimaru takes over a new body. Canon diverges at this point, because the SI's soul swoops in and replaces Orochimaru, sorta. 

  The end result is that you've basically got a woman with the values of a modern American cougar / milf but Orochimaru's ninja skills waking up as the chief badass in charge of the highly dysfunctional Hidden Sound village, and deciding to change the world with the power of compassion no jutsu. While shamelessly flirting with everything that moves. 

  Why do I think this will appeal to /r/rational? 

  * Base building: canon Hidden Sound was basically a Potemkin village built around generating human weapons for Orochimaru, and falls apart the moment he stops thinking about it. The first arc, and a running undercurrent in every arc thereafter, is the MC trying to rebuild the village into something that _doesn't_ treat the Geneva Convention as a checklist. 
  * Genre savvy / canon extrapolation: the MC has a pretty good grasp on Naruto canon and uses it to her advantage, without rubbing it in your face; the author does a good job extrapolating the sparse Naruto world building into something resembling a working universe (e.g how the fuck did some rando merchant get Zabuza to take a contract?). 
  * Rational analysis of motivations: side characters spend a lot of time doing this towards the MC, with fun reactions and analysis, because these paranoid ninja simply cannot accept the MC's "friendship is optimal, actually" worldview.  Everyone is absolutely shocked when it turns out that early canon Naruto is actually the best at predicting her.

    That thread rustles my jimmies because the story description at the top contains a grammatical error.

    >Countless Cultivators struggle through the eons, hoping to close just one each of that gap

    "each" should be "inch"

    Usually grammatical errors in the description are indicative of tons of errors in the body of a story, so I don't bother reading further. However, the premise is interesting enough that I'm willing to give it a second shot. Can anyone who has read the fic comment on whether the grammatical error trend holds true in this case?
    ```

    - u/SpeakKindly:
      ```
      There were ten errors in the first 12k words, but only one of them was remotely confusing (the rest were more like writing "it's" instead of "its").

      Having read other works by the same author, I don't expect the grammar to be an obstacle. The obstacle I expect is that at the most interesting point, the story will be abandoned.

      I do completely agree with your assessment that an author who can't hold it together for a four sentence advertisement should not be trusted to write competently. This, however, is simply imperfect while being entirely readable. It's above the rock-bottom standard of fanfiction, at any rate.
      ```

        ```
        I usually give a lot of leeway with fanfiction; 'imperfect but intelligible' is often ok with me, which is why I'm hoping to get opinions from those who have read it. A mistake falls into the 'not intelligible' category if I have to scan a sentence twice to figure out what the author meant.

  I watched the National Theater performance of *Man and Superman* with my grandparents a few weeks back and it is incredible for being older than they are. The writing, humor, and characters hold up despite the intervening century plus of social change, but so many little things ring true. If nothing else, seeing a small portal in time to when "Rich Out-and-out Anarchist" was a fully normalized political position is fascinating. 

  Cons: It's a three hour play that's entirely talking. Long musings on the nature of Man and Woman, arguments over the meaning of life and love. The recording I saw was considered great because Ralph Fiennes could keep your attention purely by dialogue.

   The characters are also purposefully less-than-sympathetic, but it can occasionally seem unclear what was purposeful at the time and what assumptions have changed in 100 years. (The start of the plot is a man's death leaving an adult woman, with a living mother, requiring a guardian). Still, fully recced if you have any desire to see "traditional" old plays.

  I'm re-reccing a few things from previous threads:

  [Dark Matter](https://archiveofourown.org/works/30153540/chapters/74285358), a post-Infinity War Spiderman fic where Dr.Strange has Peter absorbs the soul stone during the grapple with Thanos, then magics him into being reborn in Gotham in the DC Universe. Very good use of the Batfam, and a lot of clear set-up for a larger plot involving both universes.

  [Genocide Man](https://www.genocideman.com/), a great romp through a post-genetic-modification world where a few superhumans are in charge of hunting down the genetically modified to prevent another war. Great mix of mystery, high-concept sci-fi, and pretty art.

    Omnicrafter was abandoned, Magic Smithing is fucking awful, Dungeon I/O was abandoned, it's a hard knock world for crafting stories.

    [Brockton's Celestial Forge](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/brocktons-celestial-forge-worm-jumpchain.70036/) sounds like a perfect fit.  It has a *very* strong focus on crafting, and you're seemingly okay with it not having much of a plot.

        Be warned that Lord Roustabout will take 12K words to describe "Tattletale looks at the MC" and 90% of the fic is technobabble. If that's what you want, then it is perfect, and it is well executed.

          Seconding this - it’s a great read with significant crafting and introspection, but the plot does move extremely slowly. Most MC chapters at this point have something happen, followed by unlocking new tech, talking through the ethical/personal/social/technological implications of that power. The word count from the implications then helps unlock new tech, implications, etc. IIRC he’s a month into his career as a cape at 1.2m words (more than all of HP).

        Thirding the prior warnings about pacing -- Celestial Forge stories, and especially BCF in particular, are known for their **glacial** pace.

        The one exception, and the one CF fic I've genuinely enjoyed, is [The Light of the Forge](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-light-of-the-forge-rifts-celestial-forge.934831/). You don't need any particular setting knowledge for this, though there is an appendix/glossary in the threadmarks which can be useful.

  Does anyone have any recommendations for quests, fanfics, or rpg channels that have well thought out and detailed world building and/or systems? I went to read a few quests based on recommendations and I was frankly astounded by the absurd amount of detail in world building a few of them had.

    Well, you could try Banished Quest on [suptg](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com). The author wanted to make a 'do whatever' quest and created a fantasy world. It's not bad. Very long, but died before it ended. MC is a wizard recently exiled from his people, a set of iranian/dunmer cultural hybrids. It improves rapidly after a few threads, as the writing is nearly unrecognizable by 20. It's pretty polarising, but the world's detailed. Somewhere in there is an economics spreadsheet for a single town met at the beginning of the quest. 

    Also on suptg is Void Quest by Vedibere and Homeless Mutant Quest by CrustyJones. Both are dead. Void Quest is an original scifi by a rather talented writer about a human ship waking up in deadspace. The epilogue had a lot of information on the world, even if there's a few missing threads. HMQ is a lot more subtle with its world building. It's almost all background. It's a marvel mutant quest where the discrimination is dialled up to an intermediary stage of Days of Future Past, but with less silliness and it predates the movie. But the changes are very well done and quite subtle for a comic book adaptation.

    All are dead. Soma of Banished quest is a flake and writes half a dozen unrelated things. Vedibere also wrote a fun wuxia quest, now dead, on AK. And CrustyJ is dead of actual arse cancer. Lore is that the deadpool movie is what carried him off. These are in the TG archive, not the QST archive.

    Elsewhere, there's a LOTR city builder called Westernesse on SV where the author is pretty seamlessly integrating his own lore where necessary and even writes in a Tolkien style. Albeit with less breakfast and walking.

    The Games We Play by Ryuugi, it's a rwby fanfic and the OG Jaune Gamer story (I think). Might as well be a whole nother story with character names from rwby with how the worldbuilding and powers are. I really enjoyed it, even though it suffers a bit from dragon ball power escalation syndrome.

  Read civceo based on a recommendation here. Rather enjoyed the first 5 books. It's not great, there's quite a few cases where I'd make different choices than the MC and I do feel that sometimes things turn a bit too easy for him but overall I liked it.

  However, reading in the 6th book, there's a plot based on inflation and, well, I might not be an economist, but it doesn't make sense at all.

  Spoiler for those who don't want the 6th book to be spoiled but I'm curious about people's reaction here

  >!The theory is that there was an organisation that had a monopoly on trade and enforced that with exclusive contracts with champions preventing them from trading with anyone else (and using violence to bring any champion to heel who didn't want to follow those contracts)!<

  >!That organisation had very high margin on anything they traded, so they'd buy resources cheaply and resell them for a high margin, which makes sense given that they had a monopoly (so neighbours wouldn't even be able to trade between each other for resources and had to go through them).!<

  >!All currency in that world is based on gold coins. The author's assertion is that once this organisation is disbanded and free trade happens, there's inflation. I guess the theory is that there was always new gold being added to the world somehow (no idea where that influx of gold comes from)  and that the tradesmen where siphoning it away through their monopoly.  Once the tradesmen no longer exist, the amount of gold increases, creating inflation... So, I can get behind that even though I don't see where the additional gold is entering the system... The tradesmen were set up by the gods it seems as an obstacle to players so I can suspend my disbelief and accept that instead of spending the gold they gained they just made it disappear and never spent it...!<

  >!Anyway, the next step by the MC is to create a  currency  pegged to gold. My first thought is that if it's pegged to the value of gold, it doesn't help at all with inflation. It's a bit unclear because the writer then says that the exchange rate with gold continuously varies when his citizens are asked to convert their gold to that new currency... So I'm a bit unsure!<

  >!Finally, the MC then gives a massive amount of gold to an enemy (I haven't continued reading there) so as to cause a massive amount of inflation with that enemy while the MC is protected through his currency...!<

  >!Well, this is where it's a bit confusing, even if there is inflation, inflation would happen for everyone but for the enemy who just received a massive amount of gold would be much better protected from inflation.!<

  >!The enemy doesn't need to also spend all of this gold, he can slowly spend it to prevent overflooding the market...!<

  >!The idea from the writer is based on Mansa Musa flooding cities with gold causing a recession https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa\_Musa (which is super interesting in its own right) but a better parallel to this would be if the MC were to go to his rival's country, buy as much as possible using gold, then leaving with all those purchases. That would increase the amount of gold among the people, reducing its value while still giving a lot of merchandise back to the MC. This is different, because all that gold would be distributed between the population, it would be much harder to control hence the devaluation.!<

  >!The difference is like giving a massive stockpile of diamonds to de beers who then can artificially restrict the supply of diamonds driving the value up (or at least stabilizing it) or dividing that same stockpile of diamonds across people of an entire country which would cause the value of diamonds to collapse.!<
  ```

    ```
    You got like ~3 books further than me, I stopped when >!He gets “out” of a war with the guy to the south who’s got some big bad ass military but is stuck on an island via trade or some other ass pull.!<

    The whole >!”I make the dollar but backed by gold” doesn’t change anything regarding inflation, and in fact that currency is still backed by gold, so nothing really changed. Seems like a weird “I want to write this” vs “this makes sense” !<
    ```

- u/p-d-ball:
  ```
  I'm new here - and loving it so far!  I cannot stand plots that are driven by stupid characters making bad decisions that no one would make.

  So, I kind of think that a book I just published might fit this genre (an isekai progression fantasy).  The main character is doing their best to figure out how to deal with the problems they encounter, and a lot of the book involves them learning the culture they find themselves in.  The second and third books in the series will explore the MC's application of modern knowledge to the medieval setting they're now living in.
