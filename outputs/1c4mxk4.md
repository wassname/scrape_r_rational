  Four recs and a self-shill feels like a good trade.

  First up is [Float Like a Stone - An Iwa Story](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44699062/chapters/112463296), a Naruto SI. 

  Blurb:

  > Illogical? Maybe. But since when did reincarnation make sense? A better question; of all the nations in this godforsaken world, why the hell was I reborn in Iwagakure no freakin’ Sato? And right in time for the Third Shinobi War? Seems like I have two options. Become Iwa’s answer to the Yellow Flash, or pray for a second reincarnation. At least I have the power of the Gamer on my side…wait. I don't? GOD DA— [OC, Subversion of the Gamer Trope]

  Not the slickest description, but don't let that put you off. If you can get past the occasional use of Japanese words (E.G: the protagonist occasionally saying "Gomen" and shudder-inducing shit like that) it's a genuinely entertaining story about an SI making her way up the ladder in Iwa's ruthless society, with chakra theorycrafting abound. It distinguishes itself from your average Nart SI in its choice of setting alone, and worldbuilds Hidden Stone quite well, with some fun OCs. It's going in a particularly fun direction recently, with the SI >!squaring off against and developing a rivalry with Namikaze Minato, the Fourth Hokage and future father of Boruto's father!< The SI's power progression is very believable and feels *earned*, which puts it in the upper tier of Nart SIs by default.

  Also, I can't praise [The Winter of Widows](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/the-winter-of-widows-si.1140307/#post-98262901) enough. (ASoIaF SI, set just after the Dance of Dragons) 

  Blurb:

  > When she'd awoken to a new life in Westeros instead of dying a horrible death, Ursula Mires had almost done the sensible thing. Only a year away from being sworn to the Faith as a Septa and relative independence in a cloister, she had made peace with her life. What little she could remember of how the Dance went had been shared secretly with her father and kept him alive. House Mires survived the civil war and should have gone on happily without her, until at the start of winter tragedy struck. Now the only heir to a floundering House she wants nothing to do with, Ursula finds herself in a similar position to many ladies after the war. It is a season the maesters will call 'the winter of widows'.
  > 
  > Only Ursula knows what's coming for them, and she's not certain they'll survive.

  Fascinating political intrigue, *realistic* uplift (no canals, no guns, no cheats, just a lady pointing her people in vaguely the right direction and letting them innovate what she needs), fun characters (particularly Honorine Tully and Septa Nyscella), and superlative dialogue and prose by fanfiction standards. This is honestly my favourite ongoing fic in any fandom. 

  Next up is [Precocious Witches and Where to Find Them](https://archiveofourown.org/works/50506063/chapters/127594417), a Harry Potter SI.

  Blurb: 

  > It wasn't enough that she was reborn an orphan with adult memories. No, Sylvia also had to be reborn into the bloody Wizarding World. Now a witch on her way to Hogwarts she'll have to decide whether or not to put her knowledge to the use. But really, what did she owe these people, anyway?

  It's a Slytherin fic that does teenage pureblood politics without being lame. Though I'll freely admit it has a couple of silly moments, I think it's overall one of the better takes on the concept I've seen. The protagonist is believably developed, constantly having to fight for her place and status in her House, and her decisions take the plot interesting places. Thinking about it, this one would probably be the least popular here for reasons that'd prevent you getting past the first few chapters before it becomes egregious later. So if you make it through the opening, you'll probably enjoy it, I think. 

  For something completely different, there's [New Wave](https://archiveofourown.org/works/44908894/chapters/112996786), a Batman AU. It's not based on any particular continuity, so no knowledge beyond the basics of Batman needed.

  Blurb: 

  >  Some lunatic in a bat costume is running around Gotham clowning on fools, but local delinquent Stephanie Brown has way bigger problems. When her father and friends start joining mob wars Steph knows she has to do something about it before Gotham collapses. If that means joining up with rich dudes playing dress up, pasty nerds with hacking and photography habits, and throwing on a costume herself, then that’s just what she’ll have to do. Even if Batman works alone. She’s convincing.
  > 
  > In which Stephanie Brown rocks the radical nineties and becomes the first Robin, ruining Batman’s life and giving Tim Drake a hobby.

  So yeah, it's an alt!Robin AU, and it's fantastic. Easily my favourite Batfam fic. Great and funny writing on every mechanical level, character development, worldbuilding, and all that. It's a hilarious representation of the 90s, and a love letter to Steph Brown, a character who's repeatedly shafted by DC. Best of all: it's finished. Maybe not entirely to the tastes of people on this sub, but I'll take any chance to shill it, because I love it.

  ... and might as well self-shill, while I'm here. 

  [Late to the Party](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/84049/late-to-the-party), a fantasy isekai story with a little twist I've been writing for Royal Road's writeathon challenge:

  > The desperate people of a world assailed by chaos demons are forced to turn to their last resort: summoning the five prophesied heroes to save them. Unfortunately, even after all their careful preparations, something goes wrong. Only four heroes arrive.

  > One hundred years later, Lucas Brown wakes up in a ruined, decrepit castle with no idea how he got there.

  Check it out if you feel like it.

  Edit: It's early days yet, but my intent is to have the protagonist explore the magic system with a rational approach and display his intelligence in doing so, and I'd like to think the worldbuilding will make enough sense to pass muster. I want to build a cast of likeable, intelligent characters who make understandable decisions based on their circumstances and personalities. If I had to level a critique at my own work, it's that it's taken a while for the protag to meet other characters, which I usually hate in other isekais I read, but I think things will pick up from here.

    The Iwa SI seemed interesting, but 13 chapters in she's still a 4yo and we've just been introduced a full class of characters, My Hero Academia style, and I really can't stand the pre-teen classroom drama that I can sense incoming. Cringe is the right word, indeed. 

    Would you mind telling me how long this school arc lasts? The inner chakra exploration was intriguing but I'm not sure it's worth wading through the rest of it.

      I can't recall the exact chapter the academy arc finishes off the top of my head, but it's somewhere in the thirties, I think? I thought the academy arc was better executed than most, but if you don't like it, I think it might be okay to skip ahead to the graduation exam. I'm not sure exactly how much info will be missed if you do that, but the best parts of the story are post graduation imo.

    Disrec Float Like a Stone. The writing style was not bad and I struggled through a lot of chapters, waiting for some action to start. What I got was a lot of chackra theorycrafting infodumps instead. Then out of the blue story turned into suffering porn with idiot balls handed left and right. I was actually relieved because it was an unambiguous signal to drop it for me.

  Recommending a few fanfictions I have had the pleasure to stumble across over the last couple of months. 

  [Outsider’s Resolve](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/naruto-the-outsiders-resolve.1050442/)

  >   Make the best of what you have, they said...

  Looks like a standard SI on the tin but it puts its focus in places that are unusual for naruto fanfiction. Taking place about half a decade before the start of canon, Outsider’s Resolve explores Kohona as a military organization, character’s are focused on their career’s, their promotion prospects, their reputation as a ninja and the internal politics of Kohona. 

  The Main Character is Takuma and while his previous life isn’t very important to the fiction beyond a few important elements, he is depicted as being savvy, singularly focused and rather pragmatic and he needs to be all three to navigate a richly conceived Kohona without any backing, allies or (many) advantages

  It is a very human, very grounded and rational look at the Naruto world. 

  [Obito-Sensei](https://archiveofourown.org/works/23465968/chapters/56255923)

  > During the fateful mission to the Kannabi Bridge, Obito is too slow, and Kakashi ends up paying the price with his life. Years later, Elite Jonin Mangekyou no Obito is placed in charge of a very familiar genin team, determined to keep them safe in a world at peace.
  > 
  > Or:
  > 
  > Obito surviving wrecks everything, in twenty steps or less.

  It is billed as an AU, what if Obito survived the mission that killed him rather than Kakashi (though the AU is as much about Obito not being where he is in canon as much as his presence in Kohona) but that isn’t really the measure of Obito-Sensei. Obito-Sensei looks at the plot and themes that Kishimoto configured into Naruto canon and rearranges them in a way that pulls out some of the bullshit and then injects a dose of realism in its place. 

  If Outsider’s Resolve asks the question ‘what do ninja want’, then Obito-Sensei asks the question ‘what do ninja villages want’ and more darkly, ‘what are they willing to do to get it’. 

  Featuring Sakura as the protagonist, though, the fic uses more POV’s as the story goes forward, it starts more of a standard-ish naruto fare before taking a broader and broader view. A deeply enjoyable piece of fiction. 

  [Just Deserts](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/38085/just-deserts-revised-edition-mha-oc) 

  > Hisoka Higawara struggles to understand those around him, but he's learning quickly. One day, he makes friends with a girl named Nanami, and his life will never be the same. My Hero Academia. MHA. OC. Sand Manipulation Quirk. Complete.
  > 
  > Revised, restructured and rebuilt from the ground up, Just Deserts gets a new coat of paint. Enjoy.

  A My Hero Academia fiction that follows Hisoka Higawara, an OC with sand powers. This one is difficult to talk about as it is essentially split into two plots that run tangentially with each other, intersecting at points but separate for most of the fiction. The first is the canon storyline altered by Hisoka’s perspective and actions, the second is a mystery focused storyline, still with Hisoka as the only perspective, with original characters and scenarios that I would not want to spoil.  

  For the moment let us focus on the main character, Hisoka is depicted as a sociopath (this is done quite well to a layman’s eye) with struggles with empathy and boundaries, he also has a very powerful quirk, this combination is a challenge to Hisoka but also the society he is born into. This is explored heavily in the canon portion of the fiction and keeps what otherwise might be a stale retelling exciting.

  As for the mystery portion, the arc is presented early on but I won’t say anything more about it other than it is rather good and is real draw of Just Deserts

    ```
    Thank you for sharing the link to Just Deserts on Royal Road. I was a big fan of the original version on Spacebattles and wasn't aware that the author had started a revised version.
    ```

  - u/six4head:
    ```
    I'm 50/50 on Outsider's Resolve. I've been following it, but mostly because I find Takuma a decently interesting protagonist with a generally believable growth curve and hard-earned jutsu. He's built on suffering, and while he is rewarded he suffers and works hard to get his rewards. About the only thing I dislike about him is that he's maybe a bit too socially savvy.

    The writing is serviceable but frequently very dry. Nothing about the language pops, it's functional. 

    The worldbuilding is... difficult. It seems stuck between wanting high doses of realism in NartWorld3000 but also simultaneously overestimating the abilities of ninja and underestimating what that world might look like. I would complain about the levels of rational in the world, but what's weirder to me is how boring the world is. The current arc is an infiltration mission in an enemy village dealing with local drug lords and politics, and my eyes almost glazed over at the banality of it all. We understand why it's important; it's part of a larger narrative involving a ninja war, but the care-o-meter is stuck firmly to the extent that the reader cares about Takuma trying to get a battlefield promotion to chuunin.

    I'm hopeful that as it begins to dovetail with the Canon Events it'll get more fun to read.

    > Outsider’s Resolve


    I would give this a moderately strong **de-rec**.


    First and foremost, the quality of the writing is quite poor - lots of small but significant typos, and just a general awkwardness of prose that makes evident the author's lack of proficiency with the English language. 


    While I sympathize (and empathize, even) with an author for whom English is not their first language, the clumsy writing forces the text into a level of "present-ness" that's more of an obstruction than an enhancement.


    While that could be forgiven (and indeed I forced myself to look past it for a time), there are what I feel to be fundamental errors in world-building that I did not find to be justified by the text: (spoilers ahead)




    >! The existence of organized crime in an anime world where characters have significant personal power just doesn't work without a lot of adaptation. In the real world, where humans are functionally fungible with respect to physical capability, it's perfectly reasonable for parallel power structures to exist - a mook with a gun is more or less identical to a spook with a gun. But in the Shinobi world, where a powerful ninjas can decimate armies, flawlessly disguise themselves, and read minds, you can't just plop down the real-life mafia and act like they perfectly fit. If course, there's the natural anthropic response - "wait a minute," you might say, "clearly the existence of such a system means the world is different enough from canon to account for it!" And sure, maybe in a few hundred thousand more words it might be revealed that this is yet another Danzo plot or something - but based on what I've read so far, I don't have the confidence left in the author to give them that benefit of the doubt. !<
    ```

    - u/Ricardias:
      ```
      The quality of the writing is absolutely fine for fanfiction in my opinion. I wouldn't have recommened it otherwise. 

      As for the organised crime, I didn't jive with that aspect immediately but ultimately the people involved and behind the crime are all shinobi trained or have a shinobi trained sponser. 

      Plus, while Naruto ninja's have incredible combat abillties their cognitive abillties aren't too far from baseline. The difficulty with prosecuting crime is finding and proving a case, not whether the criminal has more or less firepower, as it almost always less in a real life scenario.
      ```

      - u/lillarty:
        ```
        Doesn't Naruto have multiple different documented ways of forcing truth from people via magic? As the other person said, they seem entirely fine with extra-judicial killing, but even if they weren't I find it unlikely that random non-shinobi would be able to resist the mind magic specialists they employ. 

        Also, I started reading Just Deserts and it's quite good thus far, gets a rec from me as well.
        ```

      - u/sephirothrr:

        Verily.



        > The difficulty with prosecuting crime is finding and proving a case, not whether the criminal has more or less firepower, as it [sic] almost always less in a real life scenario.

        This is a world where an entire clan was extra-judiciously executed for conspiracy. I suspect their opinions on "due process" are rather different than ours.
        ```

        - u/ReproachfulWombat:
          ```
          I have to agree with sephirothrr here. The quality of the writing is too low to keep me engaged. The first couple of lines are really important for hooking in readers (nearly as important as the title) and there are at least three grammatical errors, one spelling/word error and an issue with repetition (he repeats the word 'thoughts' four times in a line and a half of text).

          Pass.

          Obito-sensei and Just Deserts are both very good though. Strongly seconded.
          ```

          What governments do behind the scenes and what they practice in the open are typically two different things, and there are many real world examples of this being true. 

          Law exists to prevent violence, this is all the more important when that violence is potentially the superpowered magic kind.
          ```

          - u/sephirothrr:
            ```
            > Law exists to prevent violence

            No - in point of fact there's plenty of violence allowed within the legal system. Law exists to enforce social order by codifying morality. However, it should be self-evident that if you have a setting where interpersonal power relations are fundamentally different than they are in the real world, you would necessarily have fundamentally different moral frameworks. Consider what it means to have a setting where it is (even more) explicit that all men are not created equal - the power of the President of the United States resides in the social structures that enforce his will; the power of the Hokage resides literally within his flesh and blood.

            Also, you're laboring under a (yet again) fundamental misapprehension that proves my point: the shinobi world is not a democracy, regardless of whatever various "village council" arcs in fanfiction would tell you - it's a (collection of) military dictatorship(s), but where the leader is literally Superman. The "law" is whatever the Hokage says it is. The only way an entrenched crime organization could exist under this rule would be if the leader was either complicit or unaware; by the former I am uncompelled, of the latter I am incredulous.
            ```

              >The only way an entrenched crime organization could exist under this rule would be if the leader was either complicit or unaware; by the former I am uncompelled, of the latter I am incredulous

              Thinking about it, Naruto *does* have organized crime in it already, and they reveal the only two ways that I could imagine it working in the setting. The first is Gato, a civilian businessman/crime lord who tried to take over an entire nation. He was somewhat successful while his operations were beneficial to the shinobi around him, and was unceremoniously killed the moment he grew overconfident and thought he could have a shinobi killed to avoid paying him. The other example is Orochimaru, a monstrously powerful and brilliant shinobi who decided Unit 731's research methods were too tame and is raising up his own cadre of shinobi. His group generally only continues to exist despite being hunted because of his personal strength.
              ```

      - u/Izeinwinter:
        ```
        The problem is that the Ninja *are* crime families. With super powers. A non-empowered mob is going to come to a bad, bad, end right damn quick. Naruto in general is just depressingly grim dark if you give it much thought because of this: Chakra is one of the very most flexible and powerful magic systems in fiction.. and it's a monopoly of a bunch of criminal murderering syndicates.

  I have only read 3 chapters and it only has 5 chapters as of right now. The rest of the manga could go off the rails for all I know; what I'm recommending is the first couple of chapters. It was fun to think about and run the imagination from a floor plan alone.
  ```

  - u/SpeakKindly:
    ```
    This is lots of fun - but also frustrating, because it left me imagining ways that it could have been even more fun.

    The big flaw here from the point of view of solving a mystery is that if you find one elaborate story that fits all the facts, that doesn't mean your story is all that likely; you haven't considered any alternatives. Now, the true answer of "really, we can't say anything for certain" would ruin all the fun of the storytelling. But imagine if we got *two* or *three* completely different elaborate stories that fit all the facts! We would have twice the storytelling, plus we could compare how the hypotheses are doing later on when we get more information.
    ```

    - u/IV-TheEmperor:

After that, despite it being a horror manga I was more relieved than anything else.!<

  I watched the *Fallout* TV series this week, and I'm almost finished (one episode left):

  TLDR: It's ***Good Stuff.***

  # General

  For a bit of background, my experience with the franchise has been playing a bit of Fallout 4, reading some fanfiction, and otherwise internet-osmosis over the years of reading comments sections rave about New Vegas lore or whatever. I know the core elements, the general framing and themes, but I wouldn't particularly call myself an enthusiast or really even a "fan" of the franchise. Despite this, it's still fantastic TV. The characters are great, particularly the Ghoul and Lucy (Maximus is meh), the settings are all top-notch, and the music is just \*chef's kiss\*. 

  Additionally, It absolutely nails all the core elements about the Fallout setting: everything from how it depicts humanity at it's lowest to subtly (or not so subtly) sneaking in the fact that everyone in the fallout universe is absolutely, unconditionally, insane (all in their own unique way, of course). Even the "Pandering to the base"/"Fan service" -moments, where specific elements/callbacks to the game series are dropped in, these moments and details aren't overdone to the point where even non-fans realize something weird is going on (this is particularly noticeable in the new set of Star Wars movies).

  # Rated-R

  Another thing of note that I really like, is that this show was "allowed" to do storytelling where no punches are pulled. It's rated-R, and thoroughly so, as the Fallout setting *demands*. Everything from very fast escalations to ultraviolence to nudity to ultraviolent nudity: it's all in there, and even better, it feels integral to the story. In other "Rated-R" shows like notably *GOT* or, to a lesser degree, *The Boys*, the "mature" elements often feel a bit gratuitous. In *GOT*, the sex scenes and very frequent topless shots of the stars don't feel so much as storytelling, but rather just audience titillation, while *Fallout* manages to use these freedoms to enhance character, plot, and the viewer's understanding of the setting. 

  I guess this is one of the positives of streaming services. Even despite the recent trend towards enshitification of streaming as a whole, I think it's good that there's big enough of an audience and distribution system so that shows like this can be produced, without needing to adhere to the often puritan restrictions on what can be shown on "public" TV. 

  # Lucy

  Lucy is just a great character, especially because she's just so damn competent yet still "flawed" in various ways. She's skilled, tough, doesn't give up, and when it comes down to it, she's capable of adapting to the frankly monstrous, inhuman, and all-round-terrible situations she's dealt on the wasteland with grit and an enviable lack of squeamishness. 

  Her character arc, beyond adapting to the brutality of the wasteland while trying to keep her morals intact, has more elements too. For example, she sees herself--and has been raised as--essentially an embodiment of the "white man's burden". Her mission, and the general mission of the entire vault, is to maintain a stock of healthy, highly educated and highly skilled individuals, so that one day, they can return to the surface and rebuild the good ol' USA with them in charge (obviously) because they know better and meritocracy FTW. Without spoiling to much, this cornerstone of her self image and the image she has of the Vault obviously gets challenged through the course of the show. 

  # Summary

  I highly recommend the *Fallout* TV Series: particularly to those who are familiar with the franchise, but even for those who aren't, going in blind will undoubtedly also be an interesting experience. For /r/rational specifically, I'm not sure I'd call it super rational, however it generally has competent, smart, or complex characters doing things in line with their character, which I think qualifies it for "rational-adjacent". 

  Have any of you watched it? What did you think?

    >it generally has (1)competent, (2)smart, or (3)complex characters (4)doing things in line with their character, which I think qualifies it for "rational-adjacent". 

    I feel like this is mostly a rather inaccurate description of this show's characters. I won't touch on anything else about the series for now, but I'd like to make an argument just against this statement in particular:

    *(copying main cast from wiki)*

    * Lucy MacLean, a young Vault Dweller
     * #1 not competent (even if understandable for her background); 
     * #2 the way she got those organ-harvesters (and nearly herself as well) killed was not an action of a smart person, even when making room for her naivety / inexperience. It was an action of a comic-relief NPC. Similarly with failing to take basic survival resources with her once the harvesters' base got "captured". She doesn't treat the surface as a dangerous and harsh environment even after being forced to drink poisoned water for survival. She has an NPC's / casual gamer's attitude;
     * #4 (IMO) incongruent behaviour for her character profile and background — e.g. certain events should've had a much stronger impact on her psychological well-being and ability to carry on and remain balanced. Things like the initial raid at her vault; her having to personally cut a person's head off; her again having to, in a close succession: witness her captor suddenly kill a sophont, then start taking bites form the corpse of that now-dead sophont, then being ordered to personally butcher / dress that same corpse (and doing it); etc;
    * Maximus, a squire of the Brotherhood of Steel — #1 / #2 was mostly limited by the circumstances forced upon him, but again some blunders at plot-railroading scenes, like during the fight with the gulper, the bridge-Fiends encounter, etc;
    * Hank MacLean, Lucy's father and the Overseer of Vault 33 — the way he allowed his vault to get infiltrated and raided already makes him an NPC;
    * Norm MacLean, a Vault 33 resident / Lucy's brother — this was probably one of the few characters that displayed at least somewhat near-human intelligence in the whole series;
    * Dane, a member of the Brotherhood of Steel and Maximus's closest friend — same as with Norm, though was also mainly just used as a plot device and not given enough screen time to do anything worthwhile with that INT;
    * the Ghoul — felt to me like this was just an expied Deadpool. His attitude would've made sense in a Dp movie, but here he just displayed incompetence and idiocy whenever plot needed railroading, and then some.

    And to skim over the secondary cast: Titus (#1–#4) was an utter idiot and pretty much just a walking plot device; the two showcased Vaults (#1, #2, #4) had pathetic security (so pretty much NPCs there in general); the conspiracy (#1, #2, #4) was pathetic; Moldaver (#1, #2) was a prop (e.g. striving to get the MacGuffin to the point of already having the expensive hardware prepared for it, but having no proper plans about how to defend against the Brotherhood and other serious factions when they'd try contesting it); etc.
    ```

      Thanks! I liked the TV show but yes, the characters are anything but competent and a lot happens because the plot requires it.

      There's also multiple plot holes:

      * Overseers at vault 31, 32 and 33 regularly communicate with each other, how could they have not noticed that everyone in vault 32 died in the past 2 years (before the raiders came in)
      * Vault 32 and 33 supposedly meet up every 3 years (Tri-annual). How could they fail to notice that they didn't recognize a single person?
      * If Moldaver loved Rose (as it seems implied by her behavior with the feral ghoul that was Lucy's mother) wouldn't she have ensured that her children wouldn't die? Especially since the children used to live in Shady Sands and were kidnapped by their father
      * How was vault 32 cleaned up? It was cleaned up overnight but couldn't have been done by members of vault 33, so did they revive people from vault 31, have them clean it up and then sleep again?
      * Why didn't Norm just threaten to bash Bud's robotic head in to force him to open the door?
      * As mentioned Modlaver having no plans whatosever for what to do when the brotherhood shows up is just suicidal
      * I did have a few others that bothered me when watching but already forgot them...

      It's very frustrating because it's a nice tv show, the world is rather loyal to the franchise, music is well done but I think if the writers had spent more time on actually making the world consistent and making sure the characters are smarter and actually make choices that make sense.

  Are there any stories that interestingly blend very different genres/themes/perspectives or even writing styles?

    Can you give a couple of examples of what you're looking for?
    ```

    - u/Tiraon:
      ```
      Concrete ones mostly not, maybe tv show Firefly as it manages to be both a western and sci-fi. Generally though I am looking for contrast, simple example would be a setting that is both sci-fi and fantasy and balances this right or a story told from viewpoints of completely alien(to each other) characters.
