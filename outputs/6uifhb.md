## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Yesterday, I watched the entirety of [Sword Art Online Abridged](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU) (about 2.5 hours covering the first arc of SAO) and I can recommend it as not just a parody of the original show (and MMORPGs in general) or a hilarious dark comedy that stands on its own, but also as a unique and compelling story in its own right where the characters have a surprising amount of depth and development. 

  I haven't watched the original SAO, nor do I plan to, but I had a really good time with Abridged and my only regret is that there isn't more of it. It starts off as a fairly typical, though very funny, abridged series where the main characters are crazy and everyone else is an idiot, but as it goes on the characters go through some genuinely interesting development and legitimately emotional moments that are subtly foreshadowed.

  I'm not entirely sure how I got invested in the snarky asshole Kirito and closet psychopath Asuna, but the fact that I did is a testament to the show's quality. Their developing relationship is somehow both horrifically dysfunctional, unironically charming, and leads to them both growing as people. It's not *amazing* development, but it happened to unlikable character archetypes I've never seen before in a way that's actually kind of believable.

  Even if you don't get invested in the characters, though, it's still a good show. The comedy consistently got a laugh out of me, their editing of the original animation is excellent, the music is awesome, and they filled in the most infamous plot holes of SAO. I think the quality of the reimagining of the characters brings it up to the level of *great* beyond just *good*, at least by the standards of abridged series, but the comedy is enough by itself.

  - u/GaBeRockKing:
    ```
    Oh man, SAO abridged was awesome. It's the good parts of SAO (the premise and animation) minus the bad parts (the characterizations.) Honestly, it's pretty much straight up better than the original anime by every metric.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      The creators recently [announced that they're making a second season after they abridge My Hero Academia](https://www.facebook.com/SomethingWittyEntertainment/posts/534512113339844), so I'm both happy to see that they're continuing with SAO and interested to see what they do with a show that I like.
      ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      Then added in a bunch of comedy that reminds me of Archer and somehow used that comedy to fuel the new characterizations and development.
      ```

  - u/XxChronOblivionxX:
    ```
    Oh, preach it man. I thought the pilot of SAO Abridged as spectacular, but as time went on it became a legitimately great story. Every character gets improved, I actually give a shit about Kirito, people in general are no longer suicidally stupid, and the big reveal is set up across the whole story. 

    For those who have finished it, some definitely recommended viewing material from Explanation Point -> **[Fixing What's Broken](https://youtu.be/46jzSn9SLlg)** and **[Kirito and Asuna's Beautiful Dysfunction](https://youtu.be/flcX6OXh37s)**. Some really great stuff.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I agree with everything you said, though I think most of the side characters are Darwin Award contenders even after taking the explanation of why no one knows how to play into account. The difference here is that it's done on purpose and their eccentric ineptitude is funny.

  I didn't get the chance to start work this week as I was hoping. The move went smoothly, but internet wasn't installed until Wednesday, and in the meantime there were boxes to unpack. 


  I did, however, get a chance to try out Prism at the recommendation of /u/Tandemmirror.  I’m only an hour or two into the game, but already so many of the more annoying parts of the game have been sanded down to smoothness.  Some of the tricks and solutions were taken from later games, but not all have been, and while playing I was struck with the distinct feeling that this is what I remember gen 2 being like, even though it’s nothing of the sort.

  We’ll see how I feel about it once I have more than one badge under my belt, but until then I think I can recommend it to any fans of the canon games.  That said, it *is* really just an iteration of canon’s design (so far).  It doesn’t deviate too much from the core formula, values are tweaked but not overhauled, and the primary concern seems to have been preserving the feel of the original games.  With a half exception of the last point, this project shares none of these goals.  Still, it’s neat to see other designer’s approach to the problem of canon.

  ----


  Playing Prism did give me a bit of an insight.  /u/InfernoVulpix is also checking out the game at the same time I am, and he had a great moment during the second rival fight where his team had been swept, all except for a lone Cyndaquil who was itself on its last legs, who used a move learned earlier that fight and evolved as soon as the battle was done.  Vulpix observed that “I could spin this into a dramatic anime episode if I wanted to.”  

  We had both just prior discussed the merits of keeping Cyndaquil on our teams (it’s not your starter, minor spoilers, sorry), but after this fight Vulpix couldn’t possibly throw it out.  It was very much the sort of thing that happens in the anime, the sort of human-monster bond that the canon games claim to emulate but at their core don’t encourage.  

  I feel like in canon these moments are far too few and far between.  Usually what goes in your team is based entirely off of what you feel like getting--which means in my case that I am almost always defaulting to my hero team of old (Houndoom, Ampharos, Alakazam, Feraligatr, Machamp, Skarmory) instead of trying out new things.  There’s no *bond*, no actual simulation of being brothers-in-arms.  Hell, I feel closer to my faceless soldiers in XCOM than I do in Pokemon, and that’s not accidental.

  I think by having a more unforgiving environment, more lethal situations, and an overall higher difficulty, these sorts of ‘anime moments’ are going to be encouraged, not reduced.  In fact, the popularity of the Nuzlocke challenge helps confirm this, I think.  I don’t think that people are attracted to a harder difficulty, they’re attracted to the stories that emerge from overcoming obstacles and the camaraderie that they feel with their little virtual pets.  This isn’t possible to cultivate when you stomp the game with your overleveled starter, restarting at the pokemon center if you somehow impossibly overreach.

  Anyway.  Even if the game goes downhill from here, I think I’ll have counted the time spent on Prism as well-spent.

  *This isn't really an issue at the moment, but I'm posting it here in case it becomes a problem for me in the future and in case there's someone else on the subreddit who might benefit in the meantime.* 

  When I was suicidal, I had an unexpected issue: 

  Someone else, upon becoming aware of suicidal thoughts, might go, "I should talk to someone, and ask why suicide shouldn't be on the table." 

  On the other hand, when **I** would recognize that I was considering suicide, I would have that same follow-up thought--but follow *that* up in turn by pointing out to myself that I very obviously have at least one reason to not kill myself or I wouldn't be talking, I'd be doing; and so either I'm looking for excuses because I don't think those reasons are good enough or I'm just searching for the opportunity to whine at somebody, and fuck *both* of those possibilities, either one of them is enough to increase my self-contempt past its present point. 

  So, hilariously, during the period that I was suicidal I was probably more likely to kill myself than if I had been less self-aware. 

  Anyone have suggestions about dealing with this? The first thing that occurs to me is that, maybe, I need to believe that it's okay to need to vent about stuff that literally makes me want to kill myself, even if I have reasons to not kill myself and even if I know that it's just e.g. a chemical imbalance that's making these things look so bad. I'm really hoping, though, that somebody has a Third Way that doesn't involve what I can't help but mentally label as "whining," however inaccurate that term might actually be in this context.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    > and so either I'm looking for excuses because I don't think those reasons are good enough or I'm just searching for the opportunity to whine at somebody, and fuck both of those possibilities

    *Meta level answer:* If your long complicated trains of thought ("... and therefore I shouldn't seek help") conflict with your basic observations ('Okay, but I really feel like I need help"), you should probably assume that the long complicated reasoning is broken, and you shouldn't suppress the basic observations.

    *Meta level minus one answer:* If you're having suicidal thoughts and high self-contempt, it probably means your brain really shouldn't be trusted. When that happens, the Accepted Rational Procedure is to talk about your feelings (if only as a rubber duck method), seek second opinions and not jump to conclusions.

    *Object level answer:* Killing yourself is really really __*extremely-mega-super*__ bad. Annoying people by whining at them is (at worse) moderately bad. And if you don't want to bother your friends, there are therapists whose job is more or less "getting whined at", and who would love to accept your money.
    ```

    - u/gbear605:
      ```
      The explanation for the meta level answer is that each step in the long and complicated train of thought isn't 100% but some lower percentage, so each step decreases the probability of accuracy.
      ```

      - u/CouteauBleu:
        ```
        That.

        Plus, when your ideas are really far removed from objective observations, it's easier for your brain to twist them in a given direction (in this case, self-hatred). Your brain (usually) can't lie to you and tell you to conceptualize the sky as "green", because reality is giving you sky to look at all the time.
        ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      > there are therapists whose job is more or less "getting whined at", and who would love to accept your money.

      Yeah, this is what I'll be settling on, I guess. It still feels like whining and that still heightens the self-contempt but whatchagonnado? At least the self-contempt isn't suicidally high, so it's easier to take that step (which I figure I ought to do, even though I feel okay right now, because there's a difference between "your problems are solved" and "your problems have temporarily abated" and this is probably not a judgment that I'm capable of making from the inside). 

      ---

      It's so weird to think that "Talk to a therapist" is even an *option* now, let alone an option that I'm willing to take. For the past few years, trapped in a small mostly-Mormon town as I was, literally every therapist was either part of LDS Family Services (a church-run thing) or endorsed crystal healing and gay conversion therapy. 

      And the LDS Family Services folks, I've discovered over the past ten years or so, are incompetent and untrustworthy, so I could never feel at ease around them. The closest I've gotten to having any sort of legitimate therapist experience in my entire life, come to think of it, has probably been through Scott Alexander's Ask Box. Being able to sit down with a competent therapist is going to be a pleasantly novel experience.

        I'd say let go of your pride. What's it ever done for you, mister ex-missionary?

        > Being able to sit down with a competent therapist is going to be a pleasantly novel experience.

        I also recommend trying to find other people with similar problems, and listening to their experiences. I'd recommend r/exmormon and r/relationships for starters.
        ```

        - u/callmesalticidae:
          ```
          > I'd say let go of your pride. What's it ever done for you

          It's about being someone that I can respect? Which just *happens* to entail living up to higher standards than I expect others to live up to. 

          But yeah. I know it's an issue. Especially since I'm in a pretty good spot right now, mentally and geographically, I'm going to take the opportunity to exorcise on these various brain weasels. 

          I know how /r/exmormon is relevant, but how useful is /r/relationships? I've never really checked it out.
          ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            > but how useful is /r/relationships? I've never really checked it out. 

            I mentioned it because I often lurk and sometimes post there. It's useful because it lets you see other people's problems and how they deal with them, and that gives you perspective on your own.

            For me, it's mostly useful as a reality check. I often read fiction and articles about philosophy and stuff, but those are all kind of disconnected from reality; this subreddit lets me see what people actually *do* in real life.
            ```

          - u/CouteauBleu:
            ```
            > It's about being someone that I can respect? Which just happens to entail living up to higher standards than I expect others to live up to.

            Yeah, but there's pride that keeps you from doing bad things and there's pride that keeps you from admitting you need to fix yourself. "Pride, of an odd sort that drove someone down instead of raising them up" to quote Wildbow.

            (sorry to kick you while you're down)

            I'm discovering this too, so I haven't really figured it out. But the way I see it, part of growing up as a rational guy is to realize that your don't need to win everything the hard way for your victories to be worth something. Like, choosing to do things in the way that puts the most weight on your shoulders just for the sake of pride... I think I've done it, and I was setting myself up to fail. Suck up your pride, and do what works. The big shiny pile of utility doesn't care how hard you worked to get it.
            ```

            - u/callmesalticidae:
              ```

              Oh, absolutely. My comment about "Which just happens to entail living up to higher standards than I expect others to live up to" was meant to demonstrate that I'm aware that I've got problems. I apologize for the lack of clarity.

      I take full advantage of the Meta-1 answer. It functions even at my worst moments because, as HJPEV noted in Azkaban, it works even when you are incapable of experiencing positive emotions.

      Apparently my psychiatrist had never heard of it before, and thought it was amazing. So there's that.

  - u/ulyssessword:

    >  I very obviously have at least one reason to not kill myself 

    You should get some redundancy.  How much do you value your life?  How unchanging are your preferences/reasons?  If your answers are anything other than "No value, and completely unchanging" then you should play it safe and develop things so that you will survive one reason changing.

    Of course, this doesn't touch the main issue of being suicidal which is that you don't value your life very much.  This can help prevent/slow a descent into that mindset, but can't pull you out of it on its own.

    - u/CouteauBleu:

      Yeah, now that I think about it, "Inventing reasons for not having redundancy" is probably in the Top 3 failure mode for LW types.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    For your specific situation, have you ever visited /r/exmormon? It's the Reddit community for people who escaped the cult, and it is AWESOME! I have no connection to Mormonism and I hang out there sometimes because it's an entire community of loving, supportive, mostly-atheists who have all escaped from their own personal hells. They will listen to your rants about how awful things are in LDS.inc and support them because they all know exactly what's going through your head.

    Perhaps most importantly, they can point you in the direction of counselors in your area who can help your specific problems, AND they can arrange public meetups so you can do your "whining" with people who really do understand. Some kind of social network re-established, I know leaving the cult often results in total isolation.

    Whatever you do, know that what you feel right now, all of the betrayal by parents and trusted authority figures, all the fucked up things they told you about sex, all the pain and confusion and suffering...all of it is completely normal for people who have gone through what you have and there are tens of thousands of people who know exactly how you feel. And most of those people? They know from experience that things do get much, much better.

    Be well.
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      Thank you. 

      To clarify, while the Morg has definitely fucked with my head in ways that I'm going to need to take time to untangle, my most fundamental brain weasels have to do with bipolar-II (or something adjacent to it). 

      I'll shoot a line down on /r/exmormon just in case, but probably what I'm going to do is at least start with the services provided by my graduate school (since they're free and not run by wackadoos) and go from there. It'll be nice to be able to get a baseline from that, if nothing else, before I begin to look elsewhere. 

      Thank you, again.

  I finished reading [Red Sister](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25895524-red-sister) and I really enjoyed it. The setting was possibly the best part for me. It's set in a ice world which was colonized by four different "races" of humanity, each with their own magical/physical ability. With the aid of a solar mirror their ancestors were able to create a corridor of suitably temperate weather around the equator. The rest of the world is basically just glaciers that are constantly encroaching on this shrinking corridor. The knowledge that the mirror has been slowly falling out of its orbit and that the death of everyone on the planet is inevitable is widespread. 

  I've tried the authors other stuff and didn't really like it, but this is on another level. If you're looking for some good fantasy to read, give it a try.

    A combination of factors.  One, the Tobias chapter is *really hard to write,* because ... WTF do you *do*? Two, my work (which is always insane) got a little insaner around 7/5, 7/10, and then they kind of peer pressured me into a forced vacation because they all thought I was going to burn out and I didn't do any writing during that.  Three, I have a (non-life-threatening) medical situation I'm dealing with.

    I have high hopes of getting an interlude based on the u/CouteauBleu thread within the next four days, and reasonable hopes of getting Tobias out within the next ten.

    BTW it looks like the order for the near future is Tobias, Ax, Marco, Rachel.

  So I've recently started trading on the cryptocurrency market earlier this week. I use Bittrex, which has a very low barrier of entry, and I've done alright. I invested $200 initially and I'm now at $260.

  Does anyone have any advice/ideas on how to most successfully invest? Obviously $200 is a very modest investment but still! If I can turn this into $1000 by the end of September, I'd be very happy :)

  I'm accepting any and all tips/suggestions. I'll also answer any questions you guys have about that sort of stuff, though I must emphasize I've only recently gotten into it.
  ```

  - u/Spreek:
    ```
    The key thing to remember is that crypto experiences rapid boom/bust cycles. If you are going to do well actively trading, you need to be able to handle both. Everything is rosy in the bull market, but panic will quickly set in when the crash happens.

    That's why it is important to really understand the tech behind everything you buy and have the ability to avoid falling into unfounded hype or panic. For many, a passive buy/hold strategy based on the bigger cryptos may be a better option than trying to find the next pumped altcoin.

    PS:

    If you ever put any substantial sum in crypto, follow good security practices. Minimize funds on exchange at any given time, 2FA for everything, hardware wallets/cold storage, etc.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      So when you say minimize funds on exchange, you mean to store most of your money on hardware wallets right? Doesn't that make trading more tedious as you have to put withdrawal orders and deposit orders through every time you wanna re-invest?
      ```

  - u/Turniper:
    ```
    I've been active in crypto for about 6 months now, following the field since like 2012 (Back when I was a high-school student without any money). I've got substantially more money than you in there, ~40k at the moment, which is probably about 30% contributions, 70% gains. I use GDAX for ease of use, and Kraken/Etherdelta/Shapeshift for currencies that GDAX doesn't support. Currently very heavy on Ethereum, with an eye to transition more into Monero after Metropolis rolls out in September. My main tip would be to stick with the established projects unless you have a good reason to do otherwise. Plenty of ERC20 tokens and coins without a clear use case (Or, without a reason to be highly valued, I'm looking at you Ripple), have burned people in the past. NEO/GNT/XRP/OMG all got hugely overvalued for a while. More will bubble and burst, but the core projects, with an actual use case, are almost inevitably going to rise. Bitcoin used to be a solid investment, but I'm not so sure anymore. At the end of the day, use your best judgement, invest what you can afford to lose (Completely, to zero. Crypto is better than it was, but still insanely volatile), and for the love of all that is holy, do not ever trade crypto on margin. The fees remain obscene and the swings can easily wipe out even a relatively well capitalized position.
    ```

    - u/Kishoto:
      ```
      Wow, that's awesome! You're really doing good there :) 

      I'm generally just trading willy nilly and following graphs, trying to buy low and sell high. I may invest more down the line but I just don't have the spare capital right now, unfortunately. Currently have my meager investment split between CVC and GEO. Now for some noob questions from me, if you don't mind :)

      Have you been using your profit for anything spending wise? Or are you just re-investing it consistently?

      Disagree with EY on this one. I feel like a lot of rationalists are privileging the hypothesis that the statues do no harm, and thus do not spend enough (any?) time investigating whether people for taking the statues down (notably including the people of the town/county who elect leaders who vote democratically to do so)  might actually have a reason to do so.

      It's not about feels and it's not about virtue signalling. For many it's about a claim on reality: that the continued presence of the statues contributes to continued veneration of what they were *built to represent* (hint: it wasn't "history"), which contributes to entrenching a culture of bitterness, bigotry, and *false* history. Not to mention feelings of continued hostility against the black community.

      Like... Southern states are literally rewriting school history books to whitewash America's past mistakes and misrepresent the ideals and reasons for the Confederacy's secession.

      Meanwhile liberals are supporting decisions to remove icons of a divisive and oppressive culture... But *they're* the ones being accused of trying to erase or rewrite history. 

      It's nonsense. No one would be having this argument about Germans choosing to remove Nazi iconography from their culture, but we privilege Confederate veneration because somehow a proto-country that fought for slavery is considered not as bad as a regime that fought for genocide and world domination.

      I don't mind if people think Hitler was worse than Robert E Lee. I mind if they think the gap between them is so large that Lee somehow gets a pass.

      And sure, rename Columbus day too while we're at it. Consistency is not an issue here.

      - u/EliezerYudkowsky:
        ```
        It's not that I think the statues do no harm, but that I think rather differently about subjects like these, and I tend to see a lot of humor in the 'normal' way of thinking.  If there was a statue of Hitler on a street full of Eliezer Yudkowskys, they'd leave up the statue and decorate it with appropriate warnings, not try to tear down the statue.  They'd point it out to their children and talk about how easy it was to get people to put up statues of things, and so they should be cautious about being influenced by what other people venerate.  Why remove the lesson?  Why pretend that the history of people putting up statues was other than it was?  If people can't think through the lesson clearly and are so easily swayed by statues, maybe tear them all down to be sure.
        ```

        - u/DaystarEld:
          ```
          Ahhh. Yes, this makes more sense if society is more or less all on the same page: when we live in such a divisive one and the culture that raised the monument is still successfully pushing its narrative to their children, I think the social effect of the statues reinforces that narrative too strongly to ignore: particularly since we can't actually decorate it with warnings without essentially having the same cultural battle. 

          Also the lesson is still being taught, and history isn't being ignored: this just removes the opposition's ability to normalize their narrative, *and* removes the constant psychological harm to African Americans, who are predominantly on the same page about what the statue represents: a reminder that they live in a county/town/state that venerates someone who fought to keep them in chains.

          On top of that, it takes up valuable statue real estate which we can otherwise use to venerate better people, like, say, Andrew Wiggin. As long as we're wishing :P

        In all politeness, that is exactly what "feels" and "virtue-signaling" mean.  Whenever someone says things like "feels and virtue-signaling" to you, what they really mean 90% of the time is, "I am a nihilist about your morality; I believe yours is false and may in fact believe all morality is arbitrary; I refuse to be moved by moral appeals from within your system, or even from you personally."

        A great portion of the arguments these days amount to people saying, "I'm blue, you're orange.  We have different utility functions, moral realism is false, and therefore moral 'discussion' is only attempted mental subversion."

        Confused about your "disagreement" here. One of the things EY says is "maybe it's time for us to ask: should we take down all the statues? Are they doing us any good?". That isn't "privileging the hypothesis that the statues do no harm" . Maybe there's a reading of your comment that makes sense wrt this but I haven't found it. Maybe you should say in your own words what EY is saying that you disagree with.

          "All the statues" there is referring to, literally, all statues commemorating everyone, I believe, hence the "statues of the future" joke. Which while amusing, confuses the point: people are not supporting Lee's removal because he's not perfect, MLK cheated on his wife and no one is calling for his statues to be removed. Equating them even as a joke is failing to acknowledge the difference. Lee specifically led a war to defend the institution of slavery. It goes beyond "not extraordinarily moral for his time."

          My interpretation of his latest position on this is influenced by reading his other posts and comments on Facebook about it: maybe he has since changed his mind.

      If there's one thing I really appreciate about /u/EliezerYudkowsky, it's that he literally has so many weirdness points to spend he can say exactly what he says and get away with it.

      And btw, Eliezer, if you check FBI bias-crime stats, far-right (KKK, neo-Nazi, etc) hate violence is the most common kind.  The datasets I've seen include even things like the Earth Liberation Front, but it turns out that left-wing political violence was repressed to all hell in the '80s and hasn't regressed to a higher mean yet.

      The "doesn't want to do what he's pressured to do" part seems dead on to me.

      The whole incident created a strong "the right did something wrong this time, the right needs to apologize" narrative, with caveats and people remarking that not all on the right are like that (but not too loud or it might be confused with siding with *them*), basically the same "Muslims need to apologize" narrative we have with every Islamist terrorist attack.

      Trump, being Trump, is having none of that, and is being the equivalent of the guy who says "But Christians do hate crimes too" after 9/11.

    Not that I agree with their methods, but it's kind of annoying seeing so many people equating the anti-fascists with the fascists, when the fascists' primary goal is ethnic cleansing and antifa's primary goal is preventing that.

    As a non-white person, it feels like there aren't that many people willing to just condemn racism and racists outright, without false equivalences. Being a minority in any country means that you're never going to be 100% secure and safe, but just a few years ago it seemed like most people in the U.S. would have our backs. I genuinely thought a very large percentage Republicans would vote against Trump because his racism was unacceptable, but it turns out that it just wasn't important to them. I'm not black, but it disgusts me that Confederate generals, traitors to this country who fought for slavery, are venerated in public spaces. Those statues could be moved to a museum, but even if they were just destroyed that would be fine. I see a lot of Republicans and Independents taking neutral positions on this and many other issues brought up by this presidency, and I'm frustrated that people are tacitly supporting white supremacy. The idea that the neo-Nazis are a fringe group to be disregarded itself shows that the problem is very real, in that the majority of people in this country aren't willing to recognize the difficulties minorities and the oppressed face in this country. For every one neo-Nazi in this country there are a thousand who are willing to overlook it. Everywhere I see people downplaying issues related to intergenerational poverty, hiring discrimination, police violence, incarceration rates, laws designed specifically to target the poor and homeless, etc. etc. And so many people want to pretend racism doesn't exist anymore, and that BLM is equivalent to the alt-right. It's not Trump or the GOP or even the neo-Nazis that are the problem in this country, it's the average American citizen. I'm reminded of this MLK quote. 

    > "First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to "order" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;" who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a "more convenient season."

      *I KNOW, RIGHT!?*  I would have figured literal Sieg Heiling neo-Nazis would be enough for people to draw some moral lines in the goddamn sand.

      But it appears that for many people the core principle of liberal democracy isn't that we draw big red lines around human rights, to be protected at high cost, but instead that we *avoid drawing any red lines*, that we allow literally anything to be re-litigated should the litigant "sound reasonable" or use big words to express their ideas.

      >It's not Trump or the GOP or even the neo-Nazis that are the problem in this country, it's the average American citizen.

      I swear to fuck it's the goddamn suburbs.  No, seriously.  I went all the way out to the Burbs this past weekend to attend a friend's LAN party.  Three things surprised me: how homogeneously "white" everything was, even compared to white people in cities who have distinct neighborhoods and cultures, how much of a fucking bubble it actually is (their *sub shop* was a carbon copy of all other suburban sub shops in human history... I don't know how someone accomplished this), and how *ridiculously high* their standard of living is.

      Like, my friend pays less on his condo mortgage than I do in rent, and he gets three floors and a basement with really nice carpeting everywhere, perfect insulation, clean everything, no mold or rotten wood at all, central heating and air.  The only downsides are maybe not getting the ISP you want, having to drive everywhere (God that *sucked*), and living in a homogenized bubble that makes your whole life feel utterly interchangeable with all other lives.

      Nobody gives this a name of its own.  I think average (white?) people basically just think the vast majority of everyone lives like that, and then wonders why anyone's complaining when everything is so nice and easy.  I partly don't like actually living the way my friend does, but I also seriously wonder how anyone can feel comfortable isolating oneself so thoroughly from, well, the rest of reality.

    So... I may not be in america

    And my observations can be not acurate since i havent researched the subject to a heavy degree but if you want to know my opinion on this...then here you go.

    The whole situation conjured out of a stupid argument about a statue. For me its kinda important to remember and admit the history od the country whether it was good or bad. On the other hand is it worth it? The statue obviously needs to be taken care of once in a while snd its just a huge hunk of metal anyways. 

    Sure the actions of the neo nazis were obviously bad but i am perplexed by how much of a hate boner for trump people can have. He said that violence was comitted on both sides which is true since both antifa and the neo nazis came there to seek a fight even tho only the nazis run over someone with a car the contempt should still be given to both parties for inciting violence. People jumped to conclusions how trump wont call out the racist groups which he later did anyways calling out KKK and the likes.

    I would just like to note that i am not a trump supporter nor i am in america so my opinion is of an outsider juat looking at the situation. I generally think that trump is a jerk and kinda unfitbof a president but hailing him the next hitler like some ppl do is a little bit extreme.

    Herw you go...just sone opinion from a stranger

    And sorry for any mistakes cuz i was writing on mobile.

    - u/Kishoto:

      You have some decent points. Trump's most certainly not Hitler 2.0. He's not as competent, for one. But, in all seriousness, I don't think he's as intentionally malicious as Hitler was. Unless his persona is a masterful deception on Quirrelmort levels, anyway. 

      As far as your other points, you're doing two major things here that's misrepresenting things. You're minimizing the issue of the statue and its importance by writing it off as "a stupid argument about a statue". Historical monuments are important to a good majority of people. National pride (which is where the neo-Nazis seem to be pulling their passion from or at least some twisted version of it anyway) is important. Like really important. And the statue being taken down was a symbol of their pride being taken down by people they already felt were "the enemy". Hence their initial protest. On the other side, most non-Nazis were of the opinion that the statue should go down and they were also of the opinion that **being a nazi is bad.** Hence their counter protest. The nazis didn't really make things better when they had a pre-rally march chanting Nazi slogans and carrying torches, a la KKK, the night before. Thus, when the rally time approached, things were already heated and violence was practically assured. Especially considering that the nazis arrived as a militia of sorts, with shields, guns, tear gas and other assorted things. There's obviously more to this than that brief synopsis but I'll leave it there for now.

      Secondly, you're drawing a false equivalency. What you're saying is a lot like when people say "Well, yea, it sucks that she was raped. But she shouldn't have been walking down that dark alley in a short skirt at 1 AM!" in response. They're not condoning the rape, not explicitly, but they're shifting the blame onto the victim. And, yes, her decision was obviously unsafe. But by bringing it up in the discussion in that manner, you're almost saying her bad decision to walk down that alley was equivalent to his bad decision to rape her. Which is not the case. The nazis were by and far most responsible. They organized the rally, which is their right. Even if you're saying hateful shit, you have that right as an American. But when you show up in the streets armed to the teeth, when your people exhibit military-esque maneuvers that indicate hours spent practicing (which somewhat proves intent), you've gone too far. I'm not going to pretend that every counter protestor was a saint. Some had guns, some had chemicals, and some probably came looking for a fight. But it's undeniable fact that the core groups of the rally *all* came armed and ready whereas the vast majority of the counter protestors came armed with nothing more than words. 

      So when you say both should be denounced, you're making it seem as if their crime is equal. Even if that's not what you *mean*, that's what it seems like when you don't go out of your way to make it clear. And if that is what you mean, that their crime is equal, then I suppose we can't really proceed in their discussion because there's a clear discrepancy here. :P

      Overall, I get what you're trying to say. But it's important that you don't oversimplify things, lest you do exactly what Trump wants you to do and equate racist neo-nazis with the people that fight against them.
