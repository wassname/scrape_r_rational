## [RT] Gu Master (Xianxia)

### Post:

I've read a number of xianxia stories and I have to say, Gu Master (Reverend Insanity) has them all beat. Compared to it, all the other xianxia I've come across read like they were written by 5-year-olds. Gu Master is incredibly rationalist, so I figured this would be right up this sub's alley. Also, was wondering if anyone has any suggestions for similar stories?

Things Gu Master does really well:

* ***Tons of stratagems*** - Lots of characters are engaging in stratagems, not just the MC. The MC is just better than them (and luckier) in many ways. This really shows the amount of thought that was put into the plot. 
* ***Lots of powers*** - The variation in abilities truly puts Harry Potter, Worm, and Dungeons & Dragons to shame. The wiki lists out something like 800+ powers and the story constantly explores new ones, so it never gets old. Lots of creating new powers, nurturing resources for powers, etc, and goes way beyond the standard elemental quartet. Tons of power interactions. And the MC's array of powers is constantly changing, meaning we get to see new types used. The variation allows lots of strategies and storylines and makes for a fun read. Unlike your traditional xianxia where it seems every spell is just "magic strike" with new names. 
* ***Setting-dependent selfish behavior*** - Many characters wind up doing things that are selfish but in ways that make sense for their setting. For instance, people in righteous path do things within the "righteous path" framework for good reason including observing all the formalities and paying lip service for just behavior, while people in demonic path just do whatever they can, reputation be damned. People change targets and goals and switch loyalties depending on what makes the most sense (especially the MC).
* ***Reasonable reputation effects*** - Later on in the story, the MC accrues so much reputation that everyone important starts trying to go after him or trying to find out more about him, and has to pass himself off as somebody else most of the time. None of that xianxia bullshit where no one ever recognizes the MC despite all the amazing things he's done.
* ***The value of information*** - Everyone recognizes the importance of information and goes out of their way to get it. Good and bad information gets characters killed about as often as brute force strength. Makes you wonder why all the characters in xianxia never seem to bother to find out even the most basic info. 
* ***An actual epic feel*** - The way power resources, tiers of powers, etc. are introduced and shown throughout the story really makes it feel like the tiers have weight to them, which makes it come across as more epic. The story only has 9 tiers and introduces them early on, and the MC can spend hundreds of chapters staying in one tier. Unlike most xianxia which run around with something like 9x9 tiers but where the authors clearly only added the latter 5x9 tiers when their works turned out to be major hits, and where all the tiers could literally be the replaced with any other tier.
* ***No obnoxiousness*** - And to top it off, there's none of that obnoxious "arrogant young master" behavior that seems so rampant in the genre.

  Here is a counter-recommendation for rationalist readers. 

  The worldbuilding in Gu Daoist Master makes no sense and doesn't even try to. Just try to picture what the world looks like. The Gu world is divided into 5 regions that correspond to an ancient chinese cosmological concept, the central plains and the four cardinal directions. Even if the Gu world is supposed to be a flat plane and not a spheroid, what is east of Eastern Sea and west of Western Desert? Is it just an invisible wall, like in a Bethesda game? The world can't be spherical either since there is nothing to suggest contiguity between Eastern Sea and Western Desert. The author never goes into this and I suspect he doesn't really care either, even if it really matters to the coherence. 

  Ever read Methods of Rationality? Gu Daoist Master would give the Potterverse a run for its money. All of a sudden the author will introduce something totally wacky and gamebreakingly OP, like an online auction house for immortals that clears transactions instantly, or dimensional pockets that accelerate time like a hyperbolic time chamber. Just thinking through the implications of any one of these fully (interest rates? arbitrage? bueller?) would shatter the worldbuilding to pieces. Combine them and its munchkin city. 

  I really like Gu Daoist Master. It aspires to a literary, mythic quality that few others dare. I enjoy Fang Yuan's insane gambits and the rollercoaster battles of wits he is constantly in. Characters are all Level 1 or 2 Intelligent. And the author has no rose-tinted view of his own society. But I find it very hard to recommend to /r/rational

    Writers are allowed to posit a setting as crazy as they want, it just makes it Not The Real World, it wouldn't make it irrational. The way it's shown, it's entirely self-consistent.

    > online auction house for immortals that clears transactions instantly

    We have that in the real world and it isn't worldbreakingly OP. RuneScape has the Grand Exchange and that isn't gamebreakingly OP either. There's not necessarily any arbitrage opportunities to exploit, nor is there any fixed income securities market in this story (which you'd need in order to work interest rates). I agree that Treasure Yellow Heaven just came out of nowhere and was then taken for granted, but to be fair, IIRC, it was introduced pretty much as soon as the MC was actually able to be a participant in it, and is then shown consistently thereafter.

      I would accept this if he had actually *shown* something. But it's completely unclear if its a discworld on top of a giant turtle or not. Even pratchett had that answer right in the title and on the cover. 

      >We have that in the real world and it isn't worldbreakingly OP.

      I feel like this is an amazing statement that depends on what your baseline comparison is and whether its "MMORPG" or "pre-industrial agrarian economy"

    I think I disagree, at least with your specific examples.

    The shape of the world is admittedly not something that's explained, but I don't think it's inherently nonsensical. It doesn't contradict anything else in the setting, and I actually suspect it'll be a plot point eventually.

    The "online auction house" takes a cut of all the sales, which shuts down most shenanigans. The "owner" is >!basically an AI that's immune to bribery, with one specific weakness that gets taken advantage of later in the story, which is that !<>!its utility function is basically to acquire pieces of Yellow Heaven, and if it's given a large piece (incredibly expensive) it will shut down the site while it absorbs it.!<

    The time chamber shenanigans *are* munchkinned heavily where possible, but the >!regular heavenly tribulations!< and >!exact natural lifespans and extreme scarcity of Lifespan Gu!< logically almost entirely shuts down most possible munchkinry in a believable fashion.

      It completely is! So much attention is given to the difficulty of travel between regions, the nature of the magical boundaries and their layers, and hence the monopoly power of polities/entities that can facilitate cross-regional trade, the incredible scale of organizations that can accumulate treasures from the entire world, and the sheer OPness of Fang Yuan's teleport. 

      So I think it's worth asking a basic question about what the "edge of the world" looks like. 

      Even if this is a world without a pythagoras, surely this should have occurred to Fang Yuan, a reincarnator from Earth. 

      >The "online auction house" takes a cut of all the sales, which shuts down most shenanigans

      tbh even if it was a X00% markup on the market value the sheer nature of instantaneous transportation of goods from anywhere to anywhere with just a fee is frankly, insanely economy breaking. And let's not even go into how it is supposed to work because afaicr that was handwaved.
      ```

      - u/Flashbunny:
        ```
        I suspect it's going to be handwaved as something he already knew the first time around, and it's not come up in the story because, well, he already knew about it and there's nothing relevant to do there. I'd like to know the answer myself, but not having it be revealed yet isn't really setting-breaking. Nor is it unbelievable for him not to have considered it in detail during his second life.

        The online marketplace has a minimum fee of immortal essence IIRC, which means only Gu Immortals can afford to use it. A single bead is more money than almost any non-Immortal will ever see in their lifetimes.

    Ironically your comment about it's world building being based on chinese cosmology willy-nilly is what makes me interested, since combined with the Gu magic system, it makes for unique and very aesthetical worldbuilding, which is part of why I love Lord of the Mysteries.

  Got turned off by that "evil protagonist" tag on novelupdates. Not my cup of tea, thank you very much.

  For a xianxia novel with advantages you listed, I can suggest Forge of Destiny. Top 20 on Royal Road, and even that is inderrated imo.
  ```

    Read the first 5 chapters of Forge of Destiny and... very underwhelmed. Protagonist hasn't got a clue what's going on and the story shows them learning the basics but it feels slow. No conflict yet, nor anything that so much as hints at conflict, so it feels slow. Just characters being rude and tactless does not conflict make nor is it particularly interesting. Like, in the first 5 chapters of the most recent story I wrote, I already showcased the setting, explained the characteristics of the magic system including some rationalist exploits, introduced twice as many characters as this one, involved the protagonist in multiple stratagems, had the character go through multiple skirmishes and a major battle, and make some very difficult choices that clearly showcased the protagonist's ability, worldview and moral system.

    Curious what you like about it from the later chapters, so can I better decide whether to keep reading it?

  I am reading it raw and I have to say it is truly incredible. At the End of each big chapter it always feels like everything are losing control and our MC barely survives because he is ruthless and smart. It's a well written fantasy.
