## [BST][WIP] Rational Yu-Gi-Oh!

### Post:

My ultimate goal in writing this is to make someone try to explain to someone else "Hey, there's this James Bond/Yugioh crossover fanfiction called License to Duel BUT WAIT it's actually good!" and not be able to convince anyone.

~~I will keep the spoilers mild. I'll just say slightly more than will be revealed by the end of the first "act".~~ Just redacted pretty much all of it so there can be more reader puzzles.

I've watched a lot of Yugioh, and believe it or not, there's a good story in there somewhere. I'm going to make a more or less minimal set of changes to make Yugioh into a good story.

Mostly it's going to be Bond thrown into the Yugioh world rather than the other way around. To be completely honest, the main reason he's in the story is because I like the title so much, but the story is at an early enough stage that I'm sure I can find a compelling reason for him to be there and good stuff for him to do.

[REDACTED]

Cons: I have no idea how the actual card game works except from what I've seen and I kind of like that.

Any feedback/munchkinism/plot holes you can tell me are very welcome.

  Yes. Don't know anything about the source material, but yes.

  How the card game works: The first thing you should know it that it doesn't. The game doesn't work.

  You know how they printed it as a physical card game? The show breaks the rules at least once per episode, usually more. Cards have More Powers As the Plot Demands, and Yami/Yugi has the canon superpower that his deck is always stacked exactly how he needs it to be (That's what "the heart of the cards" is. No, seriously, that's *exactly* what it is.), so his *deck* also has More Powers As the Plot Demands. Later seasons (once they stopped following Yugi) mostly started following rules, but even those are essentially made up as they go along.

  I intend to make it structurally both a Yugioh arc and a Bond movie. It will fulfill the tropes of both in a satisfying way. There will be a Bond James Bond, there will be a shaken not stirred, there will be a chase scene, there will be a Bond girl or two, there will be ridiculous feats and gadgets, there will be spy stuff, saying the title, a big villain speech, friendship, card games, mysterious ancient egyptian stuff, and more.

  I intend to start the story with Yugi tagging along with his grandfather on an excavation, somehow getting separated, finding the puzzle, and Yami sort of trying to kill him to test whether he is worthy of claiming the Puzzle. Yami doesn't tell Yugi the puzzle gives invincibility, so it's more of a test of courage.

    My only question is: who's the protagonist, Yugi or Bond? Who gets more focus? And if it's a mix of both, is it Yugi and Bond together, or what? I can't see Bond as much of a father figure for... anyone, actually.
    ```

    - u/TimTravel:

      They're going to working independently for the first arc without much interaction. In the second arc, Bond will be doing investigation stuff and helping with the civil war while Yugi primarily deals with fighting the shadow realm monsters. I certainly don't see Bond as a father figure. I'm thinking they'll be mostly ally-ish.

      It'll be more focused on Yugi. Bond is a dead end in terms of character development. He has to stay archetypal in order to still be Bond. Honestly it would be a lot easier to just get rid of Bond and have it just be Yugioh, but, then I couldn't justify calling it "License to Duel" and I love the title as is. Maybe if I just sit down one weekend and marathon 6-7 Bond movies some more ideas of how to use him will come to me.

  I don't really have any feedback other than that I would read the shit out of this.
