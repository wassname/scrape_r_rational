  I quite enjoyed that. Also, [obligatory link to Zombies: The Movie](http://lesswrong.com/lw/pn/zombies_the_movie/).

  If it's just one gene it should be pretty easy, at least in a decade or two, to use gene therapy on anyone who didn't have it. Also, isn't self-awareness different from qualia? Self-awareness is just awareness of your own thoughts and existence. I don't think anyone who didn't have self-awareness would be able to operate on the same level as ordinary humans. Even some animals can pass the mirror test and all humans pass the mirror test after infancy.

  The obvious lesson from this is that zombies are evil and should never be trusted.
