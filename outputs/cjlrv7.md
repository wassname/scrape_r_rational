  >We’ve really got to get out of here” he said

  Missing comma.

  Oh, Haley is going to come back to such an unpleasant surprise. 

  >“Listen, there’s another contingent coming in from France, they apparently made contact with the English last night and they’ve got something they want you to see, they say it’s urgent-”

  Close call.

  It seems like Haley has set up some contingencies she doesn't trust herself to know about -- that, or she's already been colonized by an antimemetic SCP or such like.

  I'm looking forward to seeing how Haley's romp in the Vault-Tec future goes. Maybe she can bring home a Pip-Boy.

  Edit: you fixed that missing comma right off, cheers.

  One more (pinging /u/FormerlySarsaparilla since this is an edit):

  >“ VOLO INGENIUM

  Space before VOLO.

  Edit edit: Misspelled SarsAparilla, whoops

    Close call indeed. I didn't even catch that little bit. Although, it seems like her peace-ing out really had things kick off. My hope is that the infomorphs can somehow find a treatment for the meme virus since it originates from their world. Volo Ingenium is gonna turn into a hell of a free-for-all.

    On another note, hooo boy Sean is about to get into some magical private school level drama soon! Time to see what his unleashed magicalness can do.

  So has Sean taken control (or will take control) of *The Cauldron Stirred*? The fact that we're getting an outside perspective that's still black text makes me think so, not to mention Hermione being a voice of reason in regards to Harry/Snape. Or, more mindbendingly, Sean had control the entire time. Maybe he escapes that world and confronts Harriet before she even has a chance to narrate it, and he actually ends up narrating the entire thing (bonus comedy points if Harriet isn't even into slashfic in the first place). I wouldn't put it past this story to introduce a causal loop like that.

  I have no idea what to make of the shift to black text on the last line for the soldiers stuck in Volo Ingenium. If anything, I would've expected the shift as soon as the portal shut down.

  Honestly, /u/FormerlySarsaparilla, if your goal was to create the most meta piece of fiction ever conceived, I'd say you're getting there, and I love it.

    Confession- the black text for that final line in Matt's interlude is not a shift to Sean's narrative, it's a CSS error. I got overzealous with my find-replace while highlighting the next section. Embarrassing and dangerous in a story where the subtleties of narrative control are important!

    But I *am* super happy that people are starting to pick up on those shifts.
