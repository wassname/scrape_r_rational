## Mother of Learning as a gift?

### Post:

Hi, I posted here about a month ago about looking for the perfect rational fiction book for my bf's birthday (https://redd.it/dfw4rx)

After going through a lot of books, I decided that Mother of Learning might be the one. However, it's a web series that is available to read online for free, and that doesn't make a great gift. Is there any way to buy it as an ebook? I know he'd love it, it just sucks as a gift. I noticed a lot of rational fiction books are freely available online, so I guess this question might extend to be more general - how do I gift a free webseries/ebook?

  /u/nobody103, any thoughts?

    Not much to say. I intend to look into publishing after I finish the story, so there might be fancier options to read the story later. But for now, the story is as it is.

      Hey, had a question. Will you be releasing the last 3 chapters as separate Patreon posts? I'm ready to celebrate years of entertainment with my wallet, so let me know the plan. Also I know the appeal of 103 releases is horribly tempting, but what I'm not-so-subtly implying is that you deserve the patreon money for every chapter!
      ```

      - u/nobody103:
        ```
        Eh, doing that strikes me as kind of scummy/greedy. I love money just as much as the next guy, but I am not that starved for cash. One update, one patreon post, and we'll see how things go from there.

        Edit: Err, just realized this might sound a little harsh. I'm not condemning you or anything, I know you mean well, I'm just explaining my reasoning on the matter.
        ```

        - u/nytelios:
          ```
          I strongly disagree with the scummy/greedy label, since these will be (I assume) separate chapters and you've always had a per-chapter patreon. It's not like you're springing a predatory surprise on your patrons - though an advance warning would be nice in case anyone didn't plan to pay in quick succession. Also, money is money, especially when it's honestly earned. I think a lot of web serial authors write for the joy of writing, but it's perfectly acceptable to profit off of your hard-earned work. And don't worry- I'm not so touchy. Just sharing my two cents because I thought it was inequitable for you to lose a hefty sum out of generosity.

          If you're looking for a cover, PM me, I'm having a scene from the book commissioned and I can send you a draft for input before it's done.

      I hope you do.  I really want my girlfriend to read this but she doesn't like reading on a screen and prefers physical books.

      Great job though, this is one of my favorite stories of all time.

  You can use the fictionpress link for the series to create an ebook containing everything until the latest chapter. You can use http://ficsave.xyz/ or ff2ebook.com for that purpose.

      In case you weren't able to get that to work or for anyone else: I've made a minimally-formatted [copy to chapter 102](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lq9K_M0KgNg2AEfMgSU4V9i0xdZGs8E2/view?usp=sharing) using https://github.com/kemayo/leech, which is an excellent program for extracting web hosted novels to epub (only requires using the command line which really isn't that bad.)

      /u/nobody103 : please confirm this is OK to distribute?
      ```

      - u/nobody103:
        ```
        It's okay to distribute, yeah. I've given permission for such converters before; so long as people aren't selling them or pretending they wrote it themselves, I'm fine with it.

  I don't think anyone has mentioned it yet, but the author of Mother of Learning said somewhere that he'll release the last few chapters of the story in a batch at some point in November or December. If you do patch the existing chapters together into an ebook, it might be worth it for you to wait as long as you can before doing so.
  ```

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    Unfortunately I can't wait that long. I might just give him the version as it is released now, and add a note that he'll get the revised one once it's finished! He probably (hopefully) won't read that fast lol
    ```

- u/cimbalino:
  ```
  If you can wait for maybe one more month you can give him the full book, only the last batch of chapters is missing and they will all be released together
  ```

    Nah, make 'em suffer along with the rest of us.

    ONE OF US. ONE OF US.

    ```
    Ugh, that's killing me! Unfortunately his birthday is before that, but so close until the book is finally whole and finished! but maybe I could find another book or something and recommend it to him after that.
    ```

    - u/cimbalino:
      ```
      The book is quite big so maybe by the time he reaches the current chapter the rest will already be released :)

      Alternatively, maybe "Harry Potter and the Natural 20" would be nice if he plays Dungeons&Dragons. Book 1 and 2 (Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets) are complete though the author stopped in the middle of book 3

    I am quite literally dying to finish my favorite story ever.

      So long as you keep coming back, you're fine ;).

  A gift does not necessarily have to cost anything :) And insofar as people might feel that gifts do have to cost something, you've clearly put in plenty of effort into vetting stories to find one he likes.

  Just send it the same way you'd send any ebook, but as a link

  You can always converted it to PDF if that makes it more official looking haha

  Or to make it even more  gift-y you could even add a page containing a love note at the beginning of the PDF to personalize it, or a page at the end of the PDF outlining the selection process and the second and third options and all the books that didn't make the cut, or idk add fanart or something.

  Or/And! You could donate to the author and tell your boyfriend that you did that

  - u/denirii:
    ```
    I considered becoming a patreon, yeah! Cause I also wanna support the author if they made something that a loved one will enjoy, it's nice nice to do idk.
    I love your personalised PDF idea, I'll definitely work on putting something together! I think I'm gonna include the books that didn't make the cut for sure, cause it's a shame not to. I just hope it'll make him happy üòä thank you so much for your advice, helped a lot! ‚ù§Ô∏è

  Give something else and just tell him about that as a bonus?
  ```

- u/TheFightingMasons:
  ```
  I‚Äôd live this in hardcover.
  ```

- u/DearDeathDay:
  ```
  Just send him the first arc as a stand-alone ebook/pdf, by the time they read that the rest may be out and if not they can read the other arcs while they wait. IIRC the story was split along somewhat novel-length portions, since it‚Äôs terribly long otherwise. (Amazing, but very wordy.)

    I'm not sure I quite understand - it kinda creates an audiobook out of a text file?

        Ohhh, yes, I think it might've been the word bespoke. Well, I'm glad I got to learn something today! Thank you for explaining it more thoroughly.

        I had no idea that's a thing, but I'm glad it is! Sounds pretty great that you get your own book printed, just one (and it doesn't sound THAT expensive either). I'll keep the idea in mind for the future, because this is more of an ebook/audiobook situation - he wouldn't carry a physical copy of a book around with him to read. But thank you for this idea, it's great!
