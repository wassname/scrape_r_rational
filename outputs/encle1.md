  I wish you hadn't titled this submission with the premise. The whole story is structured as a reveal for it.

    I'm afraid the premise was so clear to me at the end of the first scene that I didn't consider the author might not have intended it that way!

    Wish I could change the title now.

      Delete the post and repost it before too many more redditers see it?

  The concept is funny. That said, I thought the prose was kind of clunky and difficult to follow.

    Only responding to the first bit here: do you particularly dislike the grammatical structure? What do you prefer in its place? I don't *think* gerund phrases particularly stand out to me over other constructions, though I can imagine they'd wear out their welcome if I saw them *everywhere*. Maybe you're reading the openings of too many fanfics? XD

        As an author who uses this structure a lot, I think I endorse the point being made, hereâ€”I have a ping to try pretty hard not to do this twice in a row, or at the start of every paragraph, or anything like that.  It's important to mix up the length and style of your sentences.

  I found this delightful one-shot recommended in another sub and decided it qualified for here and deserved to be shared.

  I think, attitude-wise, this is the same Harry as in the Objectivist Harry Potter.
  ```

  There was another fic with this, it was sorta cloud cuckoo lander Voldemort Harry, forget the name but it was hilarious and well written, over the course of the story one of the background things was Dumbledoor getting ever more blatant with using the curse to get death eaters that he doesn't have enough evidence to convict.
