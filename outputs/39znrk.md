  Things might get a bit slow on r/rational, but I still come here for rational fiction and fanfiction, not to discuss politics, and *certainly* not to discuss modern US military policy and American ethnocentrism or lack thereof. Looks like this would make for a lively discussion, but I will be downvoting it to reduce visibility. 

  I'm posting, rather than just silently downvoting, in hopes of directing this subreddit away from things like this and towards other things.
