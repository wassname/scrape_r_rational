## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Is there a way to make a rational version of "your name" without it becoming kinda horrific? IDK I cant see body-swapping as anything but horror.  


  Edit: swapped shaping with swapping

    Did you mean body-swapping?

  **ROOM OUTSIDE OF TIME**  


  I was tinkering with this plot device/scenario:  


  You find an old doorknob. Whenever you press the doorknob against any surface, and turn it, it opens a door of the size and shape that you want. The door leads to a room outside of time.  


  \- only you, or inanimate objects can enter the room. No other people or live animals

  \- when you are inside the room, the time does not pass outside

  \- when you are outside the room, no time passes inside

  \- the room is 100x100x100m, with walls floor and ceiling made of infinitely thick concrete

  \- the room has all the amenities (sewer, water, gas, electric) that seem to come and go towards infinity (there is no known end to the pipes and cables, and they never run out).

  \- the room is otherwise empty

  \- you do not age in the room, cannot die within it, and are healed within seconds from any injury (healed to perfect state not previous state)

  \- there can be only one door leading in or out.

  \- while the door is opened, the time in and out is unified. It only disconnects while the door is closed.

    If the sewers and cables go on forever that seems to be an infinite source of material, even if you don't strip the fixtures one could farm arbitrary quantities of food effectively immediately, this along with the endless water could allow you to support a moderate community with stuff you take out. It could also be used to supply an interplanetary voyage, even without using it for supplies it seems to violate conservation of momentum, by opening the door at the end of a rotating tether and moving a large weight out of the room for half the rotation and back in for the other half one could get free energy and thrust.
    There's an incredible amount one can do with a nigh endless source of time, one can learn new skills, work on things without the stress of deadlines, take time to become at peace with things, of course one does need to socialize but having the door would help on that front by giving more opportunities.

    The healing aspect might be the most valuable, you'd be able to perform experimentation otherwise banned on safety grounds.

    And of course performing arbitarily large amounts of computing in moments is valuable.
