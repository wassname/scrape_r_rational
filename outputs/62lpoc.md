## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Today I saw yet another video making fun of the Westboro Baptist Church, which reminded me of that SSC article where Scott says there are orders of magnitude more people being afraid of the KKK, than actual KKK members.

  So I researched it, and found out the WBC had... ~70 people in 2007, probably fewer now, all from the same family (clan? familial network?). I think this is the religious equivalent of the dumb reality show star who gets and stays famous by saying dumb things all the time, and that we really, really ought to ignore more on a global basis.

    That's pretty much dead on. The WBC makes it's money by being controversial, getting people to physically attack them, and then suing those people. They *need* the publicity, because otherwise they'd just be annoying, not "dangerous."

  I recently set up a dual boot, windows 10 (came with the computer), and ubuntu. At first, ubuntu was amazingly fast, but I figured once I got everything set up that it would slow down. 

  It didn't. It's still fast, and my system isn't struggling to keep up like it was with windows. Ubuntu has it's own annoyances (like having to work your way through technobabble for even the simplest of problems), but I'm happy with it so far.

  With windows, even after disabling almost all startup programs, gutting [windows telemetry](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/632984/how-to-completely-stop-microsoft-compatibility-telemetry/) (highly recommended), and making sure I was clear of viruses, windows was still *cripplingly* slow.

  It's amazing that the same computer can run so much faster just by changing from one modern operating system to another. Where are these speed gains coming from? I honestly can't figure it out.

      I don't know precisely how uninformed I am, which leads me to believe that I'm uninformed enough to answer your question.

      It really reminds me of this occasion a few years ago when I saw a monkey in a zoo hit the uncanny valley by using its hands in a very human way; it invoked an "oh shit, that's basically analogous to us, this is well on the path to intelligence" feeling.  The difference being that monkeys aren't getting vastly better at dexterous use of opposable thumbs every year, while AI *is* getting vastly better at cognition every year.

      I'm not stupid enough to think that this program as it stands could acquire any type of real intelligence, but I do think that it's a lot closer to human intelligence than it is to the best software and hardware of thirty years ago.  Based on things like "processing power derived from number of neurons" it's easy to fall into the trap of saying that this program is dumber than a single ant, or something like that.  But I don't think that's the case; it seems to contain some of the critical insights that get you intelligence.  If the intelligence explosion of the future is analogized to the appearance of the human species, then these RNN programs are, like, early mammals.

        Woah, that *is* a good analogy.

        That's a pretty good way to put it, with one caveat.  The excellent results you see these days are almost all for *supervised* learning: we supply a training set in which the "correct answer" has been marked, and we then optimize the parameters of the RNN so as to minimize its prediction error over this training set.  The RNN thus acts as a sort of continuous circuit which represents some function.  We then hope that the function the RNN has come to represent after optimization is a good approximation of the imagined Platonic "reality function" which actually maps data to correct answers.

  So I spent the last week working on finishing up the voxel exploration, and I think I’ve gotten what I need from it.


  I realized shortly after last week’s update that I had, somewhere along the line, messed up the arrangement of the chunks in the prototype.  All of them were hex-axis aligned, meaning that to move in a “column” of chunks, you actually moved diagonally, as in the gif I posted:

  http://i.imgur.com/r7zSRLB.gifv

  The chunks however need to be staggered in such a manner so that if the player moves straight up or down, they remain within the same column of chunks, like so:

  http://i.imgur.com/xi53M9h.png


  At some point I had reached the end of my math understanding rope and gotten /u/Xavion to help, which completely saved my bacon. In taking the new and improved math code, however, I completely failed to realize that the new chunks were now hex aligned and no longer offset (it was a trying time.  I was more focused on the fact that it worked *at all* at that moment). 


  So most of my dev time this week was spent fixing the formulas to properly offset each row by half the chunk’s width--most of that was spent with the variables in a spot that through sheer coincidence worked 90% of the way but failed in esoteric edge cases.  I *did* eventually get it fixed, but ugh, it took far too long to track down.


  At any rate, once I finally got the chunks organized properly, I was able to fairly quickly confirm (I think) that the cylinder wrapping won’t work the way I’d like it to.  The idea was to make it so once you crossed the North Pole, the world would be flipped--imagine going from Russia to North America via the North Pole, you’d expect, if you kept moving south, for Canada to be “upside-down” from your perspective.


  Ideally this would be faked by extending the map’s vertical borders from the range “0 to Y” to “-Y to Y”, with a negative Y just being a reference to positive Y, and meaning that the player was facing south instead of north.  The map would handle the flipping or rotation smoothly, and all that would be needed is a single layer of buffer chunks that would be the north and south poles.


  Unfortunately in practice I don’t think this works out.  I had drawn up a few different mock ups in preparation for exploring this, and they had seemed to confirm that it would work, but alas.  There isn’t any way (that I could find) to have the chunks be flipped vertically, preserve relationships between chunks, preserve relationships between hexes within the chunk, *and* not result in some portion of the map having you drive north from Canada only to arrive back in Canada somehow.


  Oh well.  It would have been nice, but I suppose I’ll have to settle for having a torus-shaped world.  If anyone is able to work out the math and prove me wrong, however, please let me know!  It would be nice to have an almost-spherical 2D map.


  ----


  And with that, I’ll call *this* prototyping phase done.  I didn’t actually deliver working executables that contained everything I wanted, but I *did* get the data I needed from each one, so...I guess that’s a win?


  Tonight I will be setting up the three repositories that we will need (XGEF Framework, Mods, Game) and start work on hashing out the specifics of the engine’s design.  I’ve got a [50 page design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SlYaK6vZ0OmkQsuVOMCIOMb6nPIU9I1vKMTFMEL0Wk8/edit?usp=sharing) to work off of, better understanding of some of the more finicky bits, and the support of a very helpful following.  

  Guess it’s time to get this show on the road.

  It occurs to me that the ideal forum probably would have these three attributes...  
  \- Each comment can have multiple children. Conversation threads can be followed even after they diverge (e.g., two people reply to the same comment).  
  \- Each comment can have multiple parents. Conversation threads can be followed even after they converge (e.g., one person replies to multiple comments).  
  \- All comments are easily searchable by full text and permanently archived. Conversations can be found and read long after their original production.

  Consider...  
  \- On Reddit and Voat, a comment can't have more than one parent. Conversation threads can't converge and be consolidated. If I want to reply to multiple people with one comment, I have to use username alerts for all but one of them.  
  \- On XenForo and vBulletin forums, a comment can't have *any* children. You can follow a conversation thread *backward*, but you can't follow it *forward*!  
  \- On anonymous imageboards, archival is temporary, incomplete, unsearchable, and/or conducted primarily by third-party sites.

  (I don't at all understand the popularity of Discord.)

  The choice of where a link should be placed in text often is quite interesting. Take [this Slate Star Codex post](http://i.imgur.com/BbksgtS.png) as an example...  
  \- `Related: Leave voters prefer`...: I would have placed the link on `Related`, `prefer`, or `prefer their steaks well-done`. Putting it on `prefer their steaks` seems a little disjointed, to me.  
  \- `Also in European polling news:`...: I would have extended the link leftward to include `are`, at the very least--or just put it on `Also in European polling news`.  
  \- `Jared Rubin on why`...: Why not include the entire sentence in the link? Or at least add `during the Renaissance` to it?  
  The list goes on.

  At the beginning of this very section, I had to choose between placing the link on `this Slate Star Codex post` and placing it merely on `post`. I feel as if placing the link solely on `post` would have seemed like... an affectation, maybe? I don't know.

  (At the end of that last sentence, I had to choose between `don't know` and `dunno`, too. Endless decisions!)

  (And all this is without even getting into whether `<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644"><em>Time Braid</em></a>` or `<em><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644">Time Braid</a></em>` is preferable...)

    I dunno about this idea of "one sort of forum that's best for all cases".

    For instance, I've had some great experiences with simple bump-able chronological feeds for low-urgency technical discussion... on the other hand, lots of folks like Reddit's algorithm, which sorts (by default) by a decay function of "yeah you should look at this" votes rather than recency of participation. You *can* implement both, but since the culture of the forum will be dictated by the default view that the software selects for a new user, you can't get the full benefit of both.

    More to your point, I have divided views on... parents and children, by way of some thoughts on quoting functionality. Specifically, I feel that while copy-paste quoting functionality is *convenient*... well, people actually use it. And I think that copy-paste quoting is generally inferior to (say) paraphrase-quoting, since C&P quoting affords misunderstandings based on the double illusion of transparency. On the other hand, of course, C&P functionality does have advantages (say, in speed), and there are domains (say, with many discrete, easy-to-understand statements) where either of these concerns may take precedence. (This is an old view, which I did not re-evaluate as I wrote it down, so if I need to change it... well, I'm not surprised!). Thus, we cannot say that one setup is strictly superior to the other, and I expect this induces interesting conclusions on the ideal parent / children capability functionality of a message board program...

  Essentially, the host takes damage and you the reader are to counter the damage they receive. The story is the host learning to live with the adaptations you vote as they about their life of conflict, some times desired some times not so much.

    I recently ordered a dewalt cordless wet/dry shop-vac. They take electric drill batteries.

    The trade off with a conventional vacuum, the kind you push along the floor, is dubious. It's less good for mass cleaning floors, but better for reaching into crevices in furniture, or doing the first pass on cleaning large spills, or detailing a car, etc. It seems to have a lot more suction for the price than most the vacuums I've used. If you're house has a lot of carpets, go with a traditional vacuum. If not, a shop vac like the dewalt portable one might be a good choice. It cost me cad $115.

    A sweeping robot is good if you have a  shedding dog with hardwood/tile floors, but it's not a substitute for cleaning. It just gets rid of the excess hair.

            I spent a surprisingly long amount of time pondering what my flair should be. Wanted something related to rational fiction but that wasn't one of the four dozen options we had to work with. Dragon's Egg naturally sprung to mind. Now I think of it, I wonder if there's a thread about it on here? Not sure if it counts as Rational though, but the extreme focus on neutron star physics is really cool.

                Wow, that's amazing!

                I found out about it on Wikipedia when I was going down a rabbit hole in high school, and I thought about how badly I wanted to read the book because it seemed so good. Unfortunately none of my local libraries had it. One day when I'm in university, I'm reading about the book on Wikipedia again and there's a button to search local university libraries for it. I find out it's in another university's library in my city. 

                Trembling I manage to put a request for an inter-library loan for it (I was worried on some level that they might say "this is a novel and not at all related to your degree, request denied!" but they didn't). It arrives about a week later and I read it, all the while thinking how lucky I am to have been able to track down a copy. After reading it two or three times I return it and then do the same thing with *Starquake*, which I have to inter-library loan from *New Zealand*. 

                Eventually I managed to find a bootleg Kindle copy of dragon's egg (at the time it was not on Amazon, I am pretty sure I've bought an official copy from Amazon since because the bootleg copy didn't have the pictures in the appendix) and bought Starquake for Kindle. 

                I've never gone through so much trouble before or since to read a book, and if I wanted to read it today I would have gone to www.booko.com.au and looked it up and probably bought a second hand copy for under $10. Isn't technology wonderful? (And I must have first read Dragon's Egg circa 2009?)
