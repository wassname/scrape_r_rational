  Is knowledge about Persona necessary?

    In the same way that reading Harry Potter is needed before reading Methods of Rationality.  It would help, and you would better understand the significance of some of the events if you knew the original plot (which is an excellent piece of work), but you don't strictly need it.

  Yeah, this is definitely interesting. Think it'll probably be one of those things I look forward to updating as thoroughly as HPMOR.
