  >Then we cut away to ESPLIN NINE-FOUR-DOUBLE-SIX

  So... GARRETT's still in a COMA and thus can't really be writing this, but I was getting very concerned until I got a bit later and realized that this is definitely NOT IN-UNIVERSE due to referencing things like CHAPTERS.

  You just killed me.

  > He then SKYPES WITH HIS BIOGENETICIST, who is helping him do all sorts of CRAZY BIOENGINEERING in exchange for PROTECTION FROM METEORS, which is IRONIC given what JUST HAPPENED to VENTURA

  Wow, I never made that connection.

  > it’s the mind of MARCO’S MORPH ARMOR, and eventually the REAL MARCO has to MURDER it by demorphing, which is DARK and GRITTY and REALISTICALLY TRAUMATIC

  > This is the sort of thing that deserves ATTENTION and CAREFUL THOUGHT but idk if they gave it EITHER of those things.

  Oh wow, fourth-wall-aware Garett is savage.

  Haven't read the recap in full yet, but I'm grateful for there being one. You have so many delightfully twisty plot threads that I'm sure I've lost track of several of them, given the hiatus. 

  Will hopefully find time for a full reread at some point when the story is complete, but this should tide me over to follow the plot as it wraps up.
  ```

- u/Lightwavers:
  ```
  I’d forgotten how unique each character’s voice was. I’m going to have to reread the entire work now. :)
  ```

- u/callmesalticidae:
  ```
  1. I love this recap so much. 

  2. Can we get recaps from all of the other characters too? >:P
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    That's a lot of work, and NOT REALLY A HEALTHY COPING MECHANISM.

    Um.  How about you nominate five chapters and assign five specific characters to summarize what happened in them?
    ```

    - u/callmesalticidae:
      ```
      LOLOL. Sorry. I wasn't being serious. I know it would be a lot of work.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        I was serious about the counteroffer, tho, if it tickles the same itch.
        ```

        - u/callmesalticidae:
          ```
          Ooh.

          Well, I'll definitely think about that then. TY
          ```

        - u/Frommerman:
          ```
          I'll throw in my vote on something mundane and fluffy recapped by Visser Three. Maybe one of the pre-pool chapters where the gang is just acquiring morphs? 

          >Wait. This planet has omnipresent, nigh-indestructible, multicellular microorganisms that children just happen to know about!? There is no way that is a coincidence!
          ```

        - u/callmesalticidae:
          ```
          I haven’t figured out everything yet, because I’m in the process of rereading the whole fic, but...if we could get a recap of the latest Marco chapter from Esplin’s POV, then that’d be pretty dope. I really want to see what Esplin would make of Marco.
          ```

    - u/Meriipu:
      ```
      cinnamon buns, dolphins

      Esplin, Ellimist/Crayak, Chee

      but not really though
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I thought the emphasis on caps would lose its impact in such a long document, but it was great seeing them continue to stay relevant throughout.

  Thanks for writing such an engaging summary of the story, and it's awesome to have you back!
  ```

- u/tjhance:
  ```
  get HYPE
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Garrett wouldn't see Marco demorphing his other instance as murder because he doesn't believe (whether correctly or incorrectly) that continuity of consciousness requires causal continuity of computational states. (I.e. if you morph into your past self that was acquired yesterday and stay past the time limit, you'll only lose two days of memories instead of blacking out forever and being replaced by another person.)

  That *sort of* makes sense, because if you change your state into a state from two days ago and *keep matter the same*, it seems you'll only lose your memories, and the continuity of matter isn't relevant to the continuity of your consciousness, so Garrett *just might be* right. But that means he wouldn't consider demorphing the other Marco as murder.

  (Another way to motivate the same conclusion would be to consider *first* changing someone's state into the state from two days ago, and *then* replacing their matter with the matter teleported from the Z-space backup. This achieves the exact same result with one extra step in between, and neither step seems to destroy your consciousness.)

  Edit: My "another way" is actually the same argument in different words.

  Edit2: Great chapter, by the way! I love how everything was kept in Garrett's character.
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    You're absolutely correct about Garrett's beliefs; that's a place where I popped out of character a bit.

    ```
    Quick, make the top-level post for it and reap all that sweet, sweet karma
    ```

- u/etarletons:
  ```
  I feel like the Garrett chapters keep having more ALL-CAPS in them, which gets distracting after a while. I liked how it was used in the first Garrett chapter, and in this one it seems like a comic book thing where some words are in bold to denote speech-like emphasis.

  That said, <3 R!Animorphs <3

    ```
    > There’s another INTERLUDE where a YEERK thinks that it is MAKING FRIENDS with a LITTLE GIRL but it turns out that this is NOT A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AT ALL.

    FYI, now that I am a mom this made me CRY, A LOT, thanks.
    ```

    - u/TK17Studios:
      ```
      FWIW, it made me cry, too.  IANAM, but.
      ```

  - u/etarletons:
    ```
    Oh, also:

    > because the person who invented the MORPHING POWER put the default setting on MUTE.

    I think this should say "SLEEP" instead. IIRC, the story's already clarified that morph-minds are lobotomized rather than gagged unless they get activated.
    ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    This one had more because I was also doing the movie-script thing; it's not representative of true Garrett, who is somewhere in between the first two Garrett chapters.
    ```

- u/sharikak54:
  ```
  Typo: STOPGAP MEAURE :)
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Thanks; fixed.  =)
    ```

    - u/Quibbloboy:
      ```
      Similar note, it switches from past tense to present tense around the time he’s summarizing the first Esplin chapter (coincidentally, isn’t that the Esplin chapter that was narrated in third person while all the others are in first?) which feels unintentional - perhaps a byproduct of the ambiguous tense of “we cut”
      ```

- u/philh:
  ```
  Woop!

  Lots of details I'd forgotten (or in some cases, maybe just not understood at the time), so I'm glad we got this. And also, like seemingly everyone else, I love Garrett's voice.
  ```

- u/noggin-scratcher:
  ```
  It is approximately TWO YEARS LATER,  and I have FINALLY REREAD up to the point where I PREVIOUSLY LEFT OFF.

  I've been busy, I guess. Psyched to see how this proceeded/ended.
  ```
