## [HSF]Extraterrestrials on Earth

### Post:

Rational Assumptions (Settings for the plot):
1. Humanity's unnaturally short history of civilization can only be explained by extraterrestrial intervention.
2.



Premise:
  The pioneers of Earth were a rather immature group of et's, competing without an end.  Their eagerness to exploit Earth led to severe strain on the relationships between their races.  The thin strand of relationship between the races soon broke off, and for the first time in their history, inter-racial crime has been committed.
  This unprecedented event brought much emotional outrage for any of the races.  The lack of familiarity between the races brought fear and xenophobia.  In this short time of extreme tension, a couple of the most influential races of the circle brought up an idea, to flip Earth's role in the relationship between the races.  Earth was to be an experimental grounds, for them to learn the secrets of the civilization to be able to increase their survivability.  
  The "experiment" was to create a new race, that would grow to be the true owner of Earth.  Depending on a race's degree of investment and influence on Earth, they would be able to influence Humans and the Earth to suit the needs of their values and beliefs.  If the Humans mature enough to become a productive member of their circle, the resources invested on this project would surely have done its worth.  Of course, the main focus of this project is the means, not the end.  Turning attention from diplomatic strains to collaboration will prove priceless.  The project quickly started, without giving any time for any race to even think about war.  The project was designed to last beyond any foresight.

 
1:
The project quickly showed off its magnificent effects.  The circle began countless collaboration projects to design the future of Earth and the Human race.  Even the most xenophobic race and the least interested race contributed to the project.  Given the motivations, various fields of study advanced dramatically.
  This extraordinary environment brought mankind very unique characteristics:  Due to the inconsistent, diverse interventions from countless sources, the inhabitants of Earth grew extremely diverse civilizations.  The extreme diversity brought mankind much adaptability and survivability, but also some uncomfortable characteristics such as violence and bonding, derived from their highly competitive environment caused by high diversity.  Secondly, the unnaturally short history of mankind resulted in lack of rationalism and philosophies; any human structure's gap between the low's and the high's settled in extreme measures, resulting in very low population utilization for use of productivity.  At first, these unique characteristics defined mankind, which appealed to any race.
 
2:
  After countless years, the project was nearing an end.  The seemly only problem left was the low population utilization.  However, the highly competitive characteristic covered this characteristic with the Cold War, and human civilizations were seemingly motivated to develop the rest of their diverse worlds.  Then, all of a sudden, the nuclear war happened.  The human civilizations have all crumbled to dust.
