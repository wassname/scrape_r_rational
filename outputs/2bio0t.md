## [RT] The Parable Of The Smart Birds

### Post:

Once there were 3 classes of birds of a feather: Dumb birds, Smart birds and Genius birds. There was also a genius bird of a different feather hanging around. All summer the genius bird of a different feather went around to the smart birds of a feather telling them how ridiculous it was to fly south for the winter — that these atavistic instincts were a terrible legacy from “the bad old days” and gave very sophisticated-sounding arguments that the smart birds of a feather couldn’t quite understand but understood quite well that they’d better pretend to understand lest they be accused of being dumb birds.

Fall cometh. The dumb birds fly south to the derision of the smart birds. The genius birds of a feather think, “I’ve heard the arguments about flying south for the winter being only for dumb birds, but where really do these feelings come from? Could they have survival value? Could the genius bird of a different feather have a conflict of interest?” Even before thinking the answers through, the mere doubts raised were sufficient to motivate flying south. The smart birds of a feather, hearing these doubts raised by the genius birds of a feather proceeded to attack them as “dumb birds”. They felt superior to the genius birds of a feather. Some genius birds of a feather were even injured enough to stop them from being able to fly south.

Winter hits. The smart birds of a feather die. The injured genius birds of a feather die. The genius birds of a different feather turn out to have an adaptation to cold weather. Spring comes. An evolutionary dynamic reveals itself…

  Hrm. I'm not sure I buy that this is actually wise. I'm not even sure what the lesson of this is supposed to be, but I bet that if somebody explained it to me I could come up with an equivalent but opposite-in-lesson just-so-fable that would sound just about as convincing.

    The lesson is actually not so much about rationality, but social dynamics between different social classes.

  I fail to see the rationalism in this fable. It seems to be just another example of the fallacy of tradition, written to denegrate people who dare challenge tradition. You could just as easily label the 3 classes happy birds, sad birds, and lazy birds, and use the fable to "teach" that trying to cure depression with change, or improving efficiency is bad for you.

    Did humans avoid trying to cure depression with change in the environment of evolutionary adaptation? 

    >  ...or improving efficiency is bad for you.

    Many ways of improving efficiency are very bad. Do you think we'd have an overall better society if it became normal to take modafinil, and leverage your lowered sleep needs to work 18 hours a day? [Algernon's Law](http://www.gwern.net/Drug%20heuristics) says that, if you can't identify the reason people couldn't use this intervention in the EEA, or the tradeoff that would have been disastrous in the EEA but is fine now, *you're* the sucker.

  I'll have to say this is the first time I've seen the word [Parable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable) used to describe what is actually a Fable. Usually it's the opposite mistake. From wikipedia:

  > It differs from a fable in that fables employ animals, plants, inanimate objects, or forces of nature as characters, whereas parables have human characters.
