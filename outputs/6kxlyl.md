  Is there a class system of sorts, and these are some lower tier demons trying to steal delicious snacks from the higher-ups?

    Doubt it. That being the case, they could have immediately eaten the kids - and there could be some serious consequences for defying demons in positions of power. Why risk having their snacks taken away again?

    It's quite possible that they are legitimately good, or - if they're not - then that other demons out there are. Appearing monstrous doesn't necessarily imply anything about their personalities; it's even technically possible that the plantation demons are a repugnant and disliked minority of demons (though that's unlikely). We've only seen a very small snippet of the world and the demons so far.
