## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*

Or generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  So a while back, I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4etflz/d_what_do_you_do_in_a_foreign_world/) thread. tl;dr, it proposes a portal fantasy scenario where you have a few gimmes (you speak/read/write the language, you get a free multitool plus whatever's usually in your pockets, and existing debilitating injuries/sicknesses/syndromes are cured), but where you notably *don't* get the gimme of immediately having something to do and people to do it with; there's no grand destiny, no mission from the king, no summoned-hero shenanigans, no coincidental run-in into loyal companions, no easy-entry adventurer's guild, no chance to save a mysterious woman from being assaulted, no farmer immediately willing to take in some random stranger, etcetera.

  Basically, a sandbox Isekai set to <Homeless> difficulty.

  But this is the worldbuilding thread, so I'm going to go in a slightly different direction. Namely, **How can a world be created such that, despite the previous constraints, people looking for adventure are still likely to find it?**

  That is to say, how can a world be set up where the protagonist can achieve most of the trappings of Isekai (adventure, companions, abilities, waifus) through character action, rather than narrative fiat?

  This is of course a very broad question, so if you want, you can think up a specific example of an Isekai setting having those qualities.

  As an additional gimme (the previous thread was just *slightly* too hard) the Isekai process also makes you pretty fit. Not like, bench press 500 pounds fit (unless you could already do that), but like, "run a seven minute mile" or "work all day in construction" fit.

    You need a few key factors for adventure:

    * **Low population density:** When there aren't many people around, the odds that you're the right person for the job tend to go way up. Additionally, the odds of there being threats to people (wolves, bears, big cats, etc.) tend to increase when there's fewer people to deal with said threats.

    * **Young civilization/new world:** An area of unexplored wilderness is an area of untapped resources. You might literally discover a gold mine in your travels if the area hasn't been previously explored.

    * **Disaster aftermath:** Following some massive apocalypse (disease, climate, war, etc.), many places may be left abandoned, potentially with valuables left unclaimed.

    * **Equality or low tech/magic level:** Technology and magic tend to accumulate in the hands of the wealthy, creating a caste of elites who solve the world's problems - for a price. With low tech/magic, the world's elites don't have much more to offer than anyone else. Alternatively, if the elites are kept relatively equal with everyone else (perhaps by law, or by culture), they still won't be able to offer more than an average person can.

    A good historical example would be the American pioneers following the revolutionary war. The New World had relatively untapped resources and the combination of disease and war had wiped out large swaths of the population. The tech level was comparatively low, equality was comparatively high, and the frontier was virtually uninhabited. There was hardly a better time and place for adventuring.

    I recommend the [Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.wordpress.com/), which does this really well. The main character, Erin, arrives in another world, with just the items she had on herself (no multitool). She barely manages to stumble into an  abandoned building, and becomes an [Innkeeper]. That would be in brackets because it's a class; the story has a leveling system which also handled really well. As in, not only the main character has this but everybody in the world, and grinding doesn't really work since you mainly seem to level when you go beyond your normal limits somehow. You get levels based on what you are doing. 

    And there are monsters, which she fights to survive. Or invites into her inn, in the case of goblins. Her inn is close to a city populated by Gnoll (hyena-people), Drakes and Antinium (ant-people), so those make up most of her other customers. Well, that and a [Necromancer].

    There is still plenty of adventure. Some of it she goes looking for (sometimes because she has to in order to find food), and some of it finds her and is really more of an attack than an adventure.

    And she isn't the only one from our world who has been transported there. All over the world, people are appearing. Depending on where they are, some do follow more traditional tropes, but a lot go off the traditional rails for Isekai, such as becoming a [Runner], delivering items between cities on foot. [Or](#s " a [Clown]. Or a [Doctor], in a world with healing potions - it's surprisingly useful. Or an [Emperor], ruling over all of one hut, because the guy remembered the story of Emperor Norton from our world.")

    There is a lot more to this story, because it is very long, and I can't really talk about much of the really awesome things because spoilers.  Anyway, to answer your question... make the world dangerous, and there will be adventure to find. Make it even more dangerous, and it will find people regardless of whether or not they are looking.

    > plus whatever's usually in your pockets

    Completely irrelevant thought: as a woman I don't use pockets, I use a handbag. Does the "whatever's usually in your pockets" concept extend to handbags? Because I usually have all sorts of things in my handbags that people probably don't usually have in their pockets. 


    (... like, I have some modafinil in there. And it's not because I'm a cool rationalist who takes nootropics: it's because my partner has a prescription for it that he's always forgetting to fill so me having an "emergency stash" for him gives him some time to fill a prescription in the meantime)

    ... For most fantasy worlds, the average first worlder gated in is going to very rapidly turn into a 12th century communist rabble rouser, because the entire social structure is anathema to everything you believe in. Yes, even if you are very conservative. That is a potent plot engine, and also very hard to survive doing. 

    Heck, one of my favorite plot-hooks is that your main character is not such a portal victim... but a native who finds the *writings* of one, who had enough grasp of the risks involved to realize they were almost certainly going to die before they managed to overthrow feudalism.

  [The Masquerade](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Masquerade) is trope that I’ve always found interesting and sought to rationalize despite how increasingly implausible the Information Age has made it, but now that fake news, conspiracy theories, and anti-intellectualism have become social problems I can’t ignore I’ve been thinking it’s time to retire the trope altogether from fiction that isn’t horror or social commentary.

  However, I did manage to find an interesting take on it while listening to *The Orpheus Protocol* RPG Podcast. The game takes place in a world of Lovecraftian horror, where the explanation for why no one knows about the Mythos is because some psychics ascended into the collective consciousness and are erasing knowledge of the supernatural to protect humanity from memetic hazards. That doesn’t stop evil cults from forming to summon alien monsters, but it keeps them a secret.

  The only other example I’ve seen of something like this is the information-consuming Voidfish from the more lighthearted *The Adventure Zone*, which also just happens to be an RPG Actual Play podcast, that created a global mental block to keep people from fighting over the Macguffins. I think this is an idea that has untapped potential and want to hear about other interesting things can be done with it, without making me feel uncomfortable in ways the story doesn’t intend.

    Some of the most thoughtful examples I've seen of supernatural masquerades actually come from semi-comedic urban fantasy novels, oddly enough.  In [Monster](https://smile.amazon.com/Monster-A-Novel/dp/B004W5KGXU/) and [Chasing the Moon](https://smile.amazon.com/Chasing-the-Moon/dp/B0052HLPZU) by A. Lee Martinez, and in the [Freelance Familiar series](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0787845MC) by Daniel Potter, magic in the modern world exists in the open and is incredibly common, but most people hallucinate natural explanations for supernatural experiences, and can't form long-term memories of anything that contradicts the hallucinations.  So, for example, you might have a friend who's an elvish wizard, but think of them as just slightly odd and new-agey.  And if the wizard accidentally summons a demon, you might run away or call the police, but remember it afterward as "that time a bear wondered into the neighborhood".

    A couple of ideas I've had in this vein:

    * Before the year 1666, nobody doubted the existence of the supernatural.  Every town had a hedge witch and pixie grove, dwarves ruled most of Scandinavia, and the devastation of the 30 Years War was the product of a rapidly escalating magical arms race.  When the hellish legions of the Black Death broke into our reality through a London portal in 1665, a cabal of wizards including Isaac Newton barely managed to hold them off.  This event, however, convinced Newton that the only hope for humanity would be fundamentally alter the nature of reality- to make it predictable, systematic, and unresponsive to the whims of individuals. 

        So, the Royal Society captured and dissipated the energy of a dark god to cast a spell over the entire solar system- a spell that rippled both forward and backward in time, which they called The Enlightenment.  The world and it's history became far simpler; dwarves and elves became human, wizards became doctors and scholars, and the dragons fled to hidden dimensions.  For three centuries, the suddenly predictable nature of reality has led to an incredible flourishing of technology.  Recent experiments in quantum physics, however, have begun to find cracks in the spell, and threaten to shatter it entirely.

    * Magic is an integral part of modern civilization.  Computers and cellphones work through a combination of circuitry and tame spirits, vampire rights are a hot-button issue in every election, and the annual hippogriff migration draws huge crowds.

        However, there's a rare psychological condition that causes sufferers to be unable to consciously perceive or accept the paranormal.  They may avoid running into the horse half of a centaur, but if you ask them to describe what they see, they'll always describe the centaur as a member of their own species.

        With the right luck charms, these unfortunate people can live full and independent lives, but until recently, there hasn't been a treatment.  Now, however, a new drug has entered pan-human trials that may offer hope...

      I really dig that first concept, especially the way you write it. I encourage you to give it a try.

    Personally, I'm still looking for works about the time directly after the masquerade finally shatters. Where the world is uneasily coming to terms with the mystical and bizzare, when magic can finally be put under the microscope, when everyday life is rapidly, irrevocably changed.

    I wrote Horizon Breach (see: my flair) as a partial exploration of that concept (Earth learns about Log Horizon magic) but as a novice author, I made sure the "shock" of the event was intentionally blunted, both by my own conceits (very few magical people on the planet at one time, confined to a specific geographic region, with clear-cut goals), and the established setting (the "magic society", so to speak, already knew all about the non-magical society, so only one had to adjust).

    I'm also reading [Should the Sun not Rise](https://shouldthesun.wordpress.com/2017/09/03/prologue/) which, aside from being good on its own merits, has a magic society that is imminently expecting the masquerade to break and therefore not stringently enforcing it as much as they used to, but still operate under it for now. It's fairly close to what I want, but still not quite on target.

    If anyone has any rec's, please reply with them!

      Not rational at all, but *True Blood* starts with the concept of synthetic blood being easily available, so vampires start "coming out of the coffin" and become known to and "accepted" in wider society. 

      That said... there's more supernatural creatures than just vampires and we eventually get to incestuous werepanthers, so I'm not about to say that it doesn't jump the shark quite spectacularly.

  Given at least a few people here seem to actually have a good understanding of quantum physics hopefully someone answers this question. Anyway the question is, in a universe with physics is the same except parity (and only parity) is flipped how would things be different?        

  The one thing I do know from research is that the weak force is the only force [which breaks parity](https://goo.gl/igJ89r) however the effect the weak force behaving slightly differently would have on the rest of the universe I can't begin to guess at.

  Still even if the effect is small common sense would tell me you can't change _even one seemingly tiny thing in physics_ without it drastically altering phenomenon at the macroscopic level. After all even if the difference in the weak force due to different parity is tiny it's still going to be vastly greater an effect in size than say _gravity_.

    I'm no physics savant but I would tend to agree with you when you say that even a small change to particle physics would change our world as we know it.
