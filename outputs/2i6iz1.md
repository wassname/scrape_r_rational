## [RT] Will you help fund a commissioned horror story?

### Post:

In [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2hoef9/any_good_rational_horror_stories/) /u/Timewinders asked for rational horror stories.  I said that I'd do one on commission; for the requested length (~5000 words) it will probably take me about 12 hours to do the plotting, any necessary research (there's always some), writing, and editing.  For that amount of time, I'd like to get $300.

/u/Timewinders has committed $50; would anyone here be willing to kick in to the pot?  If so, please list the amount and how you'd like to pay (PayPal, credit card, etc).  Also, list off any plot elements / characters / rational tactics that you'd like to see.  I can't promise to accommodate absolutely everyone, but I will do my damnedest to make sure that everyone who's paying gets what they want.

I'll do this money-on-delivery to make it more comfortable.  Please note though, I'm only committing to a length and a writing quality.  I can't promise that any given person will like the story.

  I'd put in $5 but prefer a more automated way to pay; from this I think it might be possible that you're shooting yourself in the foot by asking for a personal commitment. (Coming up against social anxieties, people feeling singled out/put on the spot, plus having to pay later is _more_ of a commitment, not less. It's not like anybody here distrusts your ability to deliver. [I presume.])

  I wonder if there's a site where you can run micro-kickstarters. Maybe something like a bounties site? I think Patreon is trying to go that way, but it's not really best for one-offs.

  [edit] I don't think Kickstarter has a minimum, and there seem to be a bunch of $100-$1000 projects. Not sure if that would be too much effort for you/for the occasion? I don't think every Kickstarter needs to be a professionally-designed _campaign_.

  [edit] Maybe wait and see if people agree with this comment or not. (People: if you agree, or disagree, please  comment! Your voice matters!)

    I agree.

    I'm broke, though, so my agreement may not have that much weight.

  I'd vote in with maybe $15 if you do it in some sensibly managed way, Kickstarter or Patreon would be ideal.

  As I told you before, Kickstarter or indiegogo are great for funding single specific short-to-medium term projects, and such an idea is perfect. You've got a nice portfolio to use for consumer evaluation too.

  If I were your editor, I'd with get at least a premise written up to sell the idea, and try for an indiegogo campaign.

  If that failed, or even if it succeeded, a patreon subscription would likely help you more in the long-term. If you have a lot of ideas, you could have subscribers make non-binding suggesting votes to give you a basic idea of how appealing each story idea is to the audience, and help you pick which to focus on next.

  I'll bump it up with another $10. And I (n + 1)th the suggestion that you go with kickstarter or indiegogo.

  Thank you to everyone who answered.

  I'm going to set up a Kickstarter for this; I want to spend a few days planning and preparing (most particularly figuring out the reward levels), but I am aiming to have it out within two weeks at the most, preferably a week.
