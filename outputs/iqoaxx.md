  Could we get a synopsis or any other plot/genre details? I'd be happy to leave a goodreads/Amazon review, but having something to spark people's interest here other than, "might appreciate," would go a long way.

  Edit: from the link
  >Of all the tribes that dwell in the hot ruins of far-future North America, the Hudsoni reign supreme, but even they fear and obey the godlike Devas. When the Devas warn of an old-world demon in the conquered city of Shikka-Go, Hudsoni war chief First Knife decides to deal with the threat personally.

    I got a little thrill out of realizing that Shikka-Go = Chicago.

    I'm starting to think I'm easily entertained.

      A lot of people have mentioned that thrill, actually. I didn't predict it, but I guess it makes sense that readers enjoy solving little puzzles like that.

  I'd review it. Is there anywhere I can kick you some donations in exchange? I'm sure you put a ton of labour into this project and you likely could use some cash. Who doesn't, these days?

    Aw, thanks! Pre-ordering the book would be the most help to us, but that might be to expensive. The individual issues are cheaper. And if you'd like to donate time instead of money, what we really need are people spreading the word. If you like First Knife, tell you friends about it. Simon, Artyom, and I also do text and voice interviews, if you know someone who has a podcast.

    But just a review would mean a lot. Hell, just this positive reply means a lot. I was a bit scared posting my request here.

    Thanks again. If you send me a PM, I can give you the drop-box link to the comic.

  I'm in.

  ```
  The art is pretty good and the setting is interesting but I wish a bit more happened in the first issue, I would need more plot to get hooked on it.

- u/GaBeRockKing:
  ```
  Oh fuck yeah, After the End CK2 but sci fi. Anything specific you're looking out if a reviewer, or just for people to go and post screeds about what they got out of it?
  ```

- u/DrFretNot:
  ```
  I will review it on my Goodreads account

  Edit: the link has the first issue (for free preview) if you want to check if it looks like something you are interested in.
