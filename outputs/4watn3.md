## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  If you are interested in learning more things about problems in the US criminal justice system (as u/kishoto talked about on [Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vmxdv/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d6116l9)), I recently read an article about a false murder confession [(link)](http://www.westword.com/news/how-to-convict-a-fourteen-year-old-of-a-murder-he-didnt-commit-8134479) that police got out of a fourteen-year-old. In addition to problems with trials and problems with plea bargains, we also have problems with investigation. There wasn't some grand conspiracy to railroad this kid; that would be relatively easy to fix, in a way. Instead, we have a much more insidious problem. The police probably think they had the right guy, and twisted things until they had the evidence needed for a conviction. Nobody gathered in a dark room and decided to put an innocent kid in prison. You can't point at a meeting and be like "here are the bad guys" because that's not how it works. Instead, there are bad incentives and bad procedures, and they predictably lead to bad outcomes.

  So, what happened here? The police coerced a confession out of him with aggressive interrogation tactics. In hindsight, knowing he's likely innocent, it seems obvious the confession is false. He had to be coached to get the details of the crime right right. Although the confession proper didn't make it into evidence, after he confessed they (perhaps reasonably) decided he was guilty and did their best to build a case against him. "Their best" is very good; the police build cases a lot, as it is part of their job. The problem with this sort of interrogation + confession is the same as the problem with people going for plea bargains, as I mentioned in the discussion /u/kishoto started: whether or not you take a plea bargain has mostly to do with how desperate and terrified you are, rather than how guilty you are. This is also true for terrified teenagers being interrogated and being told to confess. The guilty and innocent alike plead guilty to reduce their sentences, and so too can they be coerced into confessions.

  So, there are a lot of places you can run into problems with the system. Generally, and perhaps tautologically, the criminal justice system deals with criminals. Still, we want it to be fair and just. Besides the question of "is a 12 peer/juror trial a good concept" which should be addressed, but we have problems that happen before the trial. Plea bargains can have problems [(link)](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4vmxdv/d_monday_general_rationality_thread/d61fsc1). Investigations can have problems. Contact with the police in the first place can have problems. Even if all of this was fixed, sentencing is a problem going back decades [(link)](http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/flashbks/death/kaufman.htm). There's a lot to read if this interests you!

    I read a PDF somewhere that a confession alone has a powerful contamination effect on all the remaining evidence, even if the confession is transparently false.

    I wish I can find that PDF overview because it's pretty comprehensive. 

    Edit:

    One interesting reform idea I heard from a fictional story is that instead of appointing prosecutors to an office, they are actually part of the same pool and chosen randomly. For each case, a lawyer could be prosecutor, or a public defender. I think it would be great if we get rid of the much maligned political office for district attorney and such.

    Not totally relevant, but you should watch Memories of Murder. It's deals with torture and false confessions really well from the police viewpoint.

  With all the virtual and augmented reality tech popping up, makes you think of what other stuff we might see within our lifespans.

    Very exciting. Makes me think of the possibilities of getting something like the VR design center Tony uses on Iron Man. I've played a little with kinect and OpenCV and I think its possible to create measurement systems that are somewhat reliable.

    Its tempting to start a project based on this concept, maybe once I'm done with my thesis.

    These videos remind me a bit of the promotional timelapses for level editors like LittleBigPlanet or Super Mario Maker, where you get the impression that the tools are super-easy to use and bring infinite possibilities, and when you do try them you realize they're awkward and much more limited than the commercial promised.

    It's a lot of fun - but for me the best experience has been *[The Night Cafe](http://store.steampowered.com/app/482390/)*, exploring Van Gogh from an otherwise impossible perspective.

    Or *[The Brookhaven Experiment](http://store.steampowered.com/app/440630/)*, which is on an entirely different level to any horror movie... making for seriously useful training to keep a cool, calm, detached mindset in any (real) situation.

  As I mentioned in the worldbuilding thread, I've started on an Undertale fanfiction (probably non-rational). It's going decently, I've got about three-quarters of the first draft of the first chapter done, though I'll probably be waiting until I get the first few chapters done and revised before I post anything.

  There are two primary things that inspired this, both of which have plenty of spoilers for Undertale -- don't watch if you haven't played, play if you haven't, it's a fantastic game.

  The first is this [vocal duet cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2mTK1iuGqY), the second is [The Golden Quiche](http://archiveofourown.org/works/5296460/chapters/12226634) by the venerable /u/Sophiera 

  Highly recommend that fic to anyone who has any interest in Undertale, it explores and expands on the magic of the universe and is overall pretty fantastic. They also have a work of original fiction, [Crafting the Sun](https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Sun-Sophia-J-Teh-ebook/dp/B01H1QH652) published on Amazon which I haven't gotten around to reading yet.
  ```

  - u/Sophiera:
    ```
    Thank you again Cariyaga for the recommendations! It is certainly a pleasant surprise to be mentioned here.

    I'd like to add some more information about [Crafting the Sun](https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Sun-Sophia-J-Teh-ebook/dp/B01H1QH652) for those who prefer Sci-fi.

    In the simplest terms, it's a character driven Science Fiction novel of the robot future variety. It has a set lore and its own consistent world science. It's not hard-science (as in following our universe to its closest), but it still adheres to its own rules.

    I will be very thankful if other Sci-fi fans can spare a little money and time to check it out.

  Anyone intrested or have any thoughts on [Tabby's star](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.01316v1.pdf)  as mentioned [Gizmodo TL:DR or clickbait](http://gizmodo.com/the-so-called-alien-megastructure-just-got-even-more-my-1784883811) The star's observed output is decreasing in a strange way.  Current models don't explain the observed changes; potentially raising the probability that we are looking at a Dyson swarm or other mega-structure construction project. 

  I'm still working through the paper, and I doubt that's the best explanation but it's interesting.

    Thanks! This is the first I've heard of this.

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:

      You are very welcome.  Got distracted so I've only read the Intro and conclusion so far, the analysis will be a bit of a slog, not my field.  Gizmodo's spin is the exciting angle, as always, but the basic point that what looks to me, as a layman, as the most reasonable explanation doesn't work, so that probability mas must be distributed among the remaining ideas, which includes alien mega-structures, or something we just haven't thought of yet.
      ```

      - u/VanPeer:
        ```
        Reminds me when pulsars were first discovered and looked plausibly like artificial signals until the real explanation turned out to be more mundane. One can hope it's something more exciting this time. Could it be a combination of mundane causes, I wonder.

  Am I the only person who doesn't like Stranger Things? I don't think it's a bad show, I just didn't get invested in the story or characters when it seems like everyone else did. I thought it was just okay and figured people liked it just because it paid homage to stories they liked, but then [Chris Stuckmann](https://youtu.be/V8yMzgp_YuE) carefully explained why he thought the show stands on its own so I'm at a loss.
  ```

  - u/PL_TOC:
    ```
    People say this often and frequently, but I think standards are just a lot lower these days. One thing that stuckmann identified was something that nagged me as I was watching the series. The "homages". Sorry Hollywood, in my mind an homage is a quick reference to another work, like with a throwaway line of dialogue or a quick shot done in another film maker's style, NOT plot lines and character dynamics.
    ```

    - u/wtfbbc:
      ```
      The difference between the two types of homages you just referenced, is that not knowing about the other work would subtract from my enjoyment of this story in the case of a "throwaway line of dialogue", whereas plot lines and character dynamics are able to be enjoyed without understanding everything that came before. In the end, there's only a finite number of combinations of good plots and character dynamics, and [creativity inherently depends on copying](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/), so I'll give *Stranger Things* a free pass on both those elements.

      I'm fiercely enjoying it in my ignorance of 1980s anything, btw.

      But he did notice those, complain about them, and recommend the series anyway.

    I agree, I thought it was super predictable,  boring, had lots of cliches, and made no sense.

    How did this boy learn to control electricity? Did he use lights to spell out "run" while being in the same room with the monster? Why would he immediately stop responding when there's anyone else in the room? If that lady knew she sounds crazy, and that nobody would believe her, why on earth would she keep trying to incoherently convince everyone? Whats up with the love triangle plotline between the jerk and the American-Beauty-guy, was it even necessary? Did the evil doctor have any motivation, or was he just evil for no reason? Also, why don't these people ever communicate with each other? 

    That's just the most frustrating stuff that I remember now.

  Finished listening to The Martian and Ready Player One. If you haven't read The Martian yet - you absolutely should, it's amazing. Audiobook perfomance is also fantastic.

  Ready Player One had a few irrational/weird moments, but I have enjoyed it a lot.

  Can somebody recommend some great scifi audiobooks? I'm really into it now, have some free time, and a bunch of audible credits. What's the best stuff you've listened to recently? I'm looking for pretty much any kind of great scifi, except for too heavy/depressing/dystopian things.

    I recommend the Legion books by Brandon Sanderson. They're pretty mundane for the most part, it just has a weird premise and a hi-tech gadget as a macguffin, but I found them interesting and entertaining. I like the second book much more than the first, which was just a novella, but I had a good time listening to them both.

    Favorites from my library I re-listen to a lot:

    Look at everything else [Wil-wheaton](http://www.audible.com/search/ref=a_search_tseft?advsearchKeywords=wil+wheaton&filterby=field-keywords&sprefixRefmarker=nb_sb_ss_i_0_3&sprefix=wil) narrates, trust me, you'll like it or at least I have enjoyed Red-shirts and Lock-In, and What-If (though I already knew most of it by rote)so far.

    [Accelerando](http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Accelerando-Audiobook/B00J3542OI) Charles Stross
    *A Classic*  I'd also recommend Glass House but it is a bit too Dystopian

    The Quantum Thief, The Fractal Prince, and The Causal Angel  [Hannu Rajaniemi](https://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=Hannu+Rajaniemi)
    *One level is an adventurous thief tale with a rising Godzilla threshold, another level is a mostly fair mystery told in median res about what happened in the singularity, and a fair bit of physics porn.  A book that either disrupts immersions by smacking you in the skull with the setting vocabulary or makes you fight to tread water and figure it out before you get a definition* **Note: no glossary**


    The Expanse series [James S. A. Corey](http://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=James+S.+A.+Corey)
    *The closest a series can get to Firefly, while still observing Economics and physics IMHO.  The new Scify TV series is pretty good, but this is better.*
    [Late 3rd book spoiler "One hundred and thirteen times a second, it reaches out"](#s "If you get far enough you get a nice look at what the fall out of a war between transcendent beings at different Kardashev levels might realistically look like to early post nuclear fusion humans, without breaking the story")

    Seconded on Leagion, or really anything by Sanderson, but I was hooked on the Wheel of Time over two decades ago, so my bias probably needs reassessment.

    Just about anything by the [Robert A. Heinlein](http://www.audible.com/search?searchAuthor=Robert+Heinlein)  *Fair warning, rampant sexism, nationalism, cranky old men, good stories, and at least two good swings at solipsistic pantheon-ism.*  Oh and **The moon is a harsh mistress** has quiet possibly the best discussion of Rods from Gods as a military tactic, decent orbital mechanics, and badly anthropomorphic AI, though I was always partial to **The Cat who walks through walls, A comedy of manners**, but it is really the 3rd or 4th to last book to read if you want to read the full history as Myth series most of his works amalgamate into.
    ```

    - u/raymestalez:
      ```
      Awesome, thank you very much! Added the books to my reading list, listening to Accelerando.
