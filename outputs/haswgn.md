## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Here are some ideas I've been kicking around lately without much development other than contemplating them and writing down extremely rough drafts. If there are existing stories with similar premises I'd love to read them. 

  - Prehistoric societies dealing with cosmic horrors through eminently prehistoric intuition, cooperation, reverence and cunning rather than the modern sophistication, manipulation, disgust, and analysis which is more typical of the cosmic horror genre. It'd follow them step-by-step and detailing how the relationship progresses over the course of individual lives as well as generations. 

  - A superintelligent entity is reincarnated as a stray cat in Manhattan 1991, retaining a great deal of their cognitive abilities and some of their memories. The story of how they attempted to conquer the universe or pursue whatever grand goal they set their mind to. 

  - An alternate history where an early Proto-Germanic culture gained their equivalent of a Genghis Khan or Alexander the Great and as successful as the both of them combined. Essentially a world whose philosophy and politics are largely influenced by this culture instead of Greco-Romans. 

  - The atmosphere of Warhammer 40k but much harder speculative fiction built from the ground up. There'll be some level of handwaveium for certain aspects, the majority of the hardness will come from the anthropological aspects. The scale of the universe will be much more consistent and the weaponry will be dealt with much more realistically. No more, "impressive" shots from soldiers that are relatively amateur marksmanship. No more, "massive" wars that are eclipsed by the Eastern front in World War II. Even more traditionalist, romantic, and hawkish in its ethos. 

  - Hard speculative biology, religious missionaries in the far future trying to evangelize to [starfish aliens.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StarfishAliens) Roughly as alien in almost every way as sac fungi are to mammals, except both are technically sapient beings with some notion of spirituality. 

  - Similar starfish aliens trying to evangelize their religion to humanity.

  - A hard fiction story about a vigilante who is a kinesthetic genius. Going beyond just an extremely good tactile learner, being able to learn physical arts multitudes faster than most people.

  Feel free to give your thoughts and/or to steal them for yourself. Any one of these would probably demand a lot of research and creativity to truly execute well.

    **Superintelligent Cat** - This sounds like a great premise for a short comedy, but I don't think it'd work well for a longer or more serious work, since the protagonist is actively opposed to what makes the premise fun. Eventually they'll run out of problems caused by being a cat.

    **Harder speculative fiction 40k** - This sounds super interesting and fun as a setting, but I think it'd run into the same problems I have with 40k: I'm more interested in reading about it as a setting than in reading stories set there, because it's full of people who suck that I don't want to read stories about. But obviously there are people who still enjoy that, I guess.

    For any land-war focused space setting, I'd recommend avoiding interplanetary-capable starships entirely and instead using a Stargate style transportation method. It solves a ton of problems.

    **Evangelizing to starfish aliens** - Speaker For The Dead does this, and I think there might be more if it later in the Ender's Game series, but I lost interest in it shortly into the next book.

    **Being evangelized by starfish aliens** - This sounds like it has a lot of potential, especially if it's somewhat working.

  **tl;dr how can I be more woke as a writer**

  Writing question: 

  Current events have made me want to be a bit more diverse in my writing in all manner of ways. As a cishet white person, I'm kind of at a disadvantage in terms of that: like, I have 0 of the experience necessary to write a believable Sri Lankan diaspora character, and I know that writing narratives about Blackness or Gayness or Transness or whatever are basically not what I should be focusing on. I should be focusing on including "diverse characters" and using them as "normal" characters, and let people from those communities write their experiences in their own works. This is great for me as I don't have any particular interest in Sri Lankan customs, so wouldn't want to write a story that featured them heavily. But I could just have a character who "happened to be Sri Lankan", learn some basic stuff so I don't accidentally have her celebrate the wrong thing, and off to the races.

  Does anyone have any sources (articles, etc) that they recommend for how to be more diverse, or "do activism", in your writing as a cishet white person? What should be avoided? What are good ideas? What are types of diversity I haven't even thought of that I probably should?

  In that vein I'd like to leave this great resource I found for writing skin colour (which is also like the second result on google so easy to find again): https://writingwithcolor.tumblr.com/post/96830966357/writing-with-color-description-guide-words-for

  I recall /u/tk17studios describing Marco's skin as "penny-dark" in the recent A:tR update and that sort of thing can be really evocative and poetic. I know I struggled when I learned that using food terms (tea or coffee coloured etc) to describe peoples' skin is considered offensive by many, but this article helped me settle on new terms that performed the same description while offending nobody. I especially loved how this series really helped outline some of the beauty in skin colour: I think they say you can describe dark skin as "purple-black" and that's *beautiful* and not weirdly loaded or sexist like "dark chocolate" is.

    I should think that it depends on the origin of said POC, no? I'm wondering if I'd be weirded out by comments that POCs in the West might feel okay with, and vice-versa.

      I assume you're talking about the food descriptions of skin colour? Or something else? And yeah, I think everything depends on everyone, know your audience and all that. But if there's a broad group of people who find something offensive, it doesn't matter that the feeling isn't universal. Especially when it's something as easy to avoid and unnecessary as certain type of descriptions.

        I was thinking about things in general - but if somebody told me that I look like dark chocolate, I'll assume that (if its not somebody I know) that the particular person is Not Very Mature or is trying for a joke that happened to be Very Awkward.

          Yeah, the blog I linked to has some interesting context in an American-centric lens (I think on some posts that were linked to from that one). Especially women being catcalled with that sort of thing as a pickup line.
          ```

            Yes, I see

    Today I learned!

    I haven't dived deep in the Writing With Colour yet, but I wonder if the same food-term embargo does or should apply to hair colour?  My first guess is that hair colour isn't tied to racial identity the same way skin colour is, so it doesn't have the same fetishization baggage?

  In case anyone's curious; as of this morning, my mid-year NaNoWriMo is up to 47,235 words of a first-draft. I started just three weeks ago, on the 28th, so I'd say I've got the words-per-day part of my writing habits firmly in place. :)

  I'm reaching a point in the draft that I have little experience with, and is really giving my poor skills a stretch: trying to write a satisfying climax. But since my goal is just to write a complete novel, even if it's a terrible one, if I can't think of some good text to write... then I'll just write the best I can come up with, finish this, and then start trying to write the next thing, which will hopefully be slightly less terrible.

  If you'd like to help beta-read the first draft before I declare it complete, this is probably your last chance to offer constructive criticism; I'll be happy to PM the link to the GDoc to anyone who asks.

  I'm writing a short story about first contact and linguistics on /r/HFY. Everything's by the seat of my pants, so if anyone has any advice or suggestions to offer I'll be glad to take them. [link] (https://amp.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/gxt82z/xenolinguists/)

  I have two chapters done and expect to finish with between 4 and 8 total (inclusive.)

  I developed a fictional country as an exercise with obscure political and economic ideas that I'd like some feedback on. https://docs.google.com/document/d/17XdKfhcpd9xnfjPEwRIEQZXmxF42gW2ImOcqBrsyBp0/edit?usp=sharing
