  Interesting Amazon reviews, don't seem to suggest it's very rational. Contains spoilers.

  >! This is an interesting read for sure but it's also seriously weird. Spoilers coming so look away.

  > The MC hears about a game he can make tons of cash in to support his family. Ok reasonable, and hes desperate enough to try it. Again ok. Where it takes a super weird twist is when some rando dude hands him a magical invisibility cloak for a few rabbit hides. Then he uses that to sneak in to an exclusive and super powerful guild. Then he accidentally joins said guild. While there he makes plans to use his cloak to rob the place, but only steals one treasure map. Cause hes not a thief see? He finds the loot wich turns out to be a magical sword and amulet. Then gets poisoned after slaying a demon and gets robbed of everything. Including what he had in his bank some how. He tells a GM but apparently GMs have 0 power in the game they just greet new players. They cant even delete illegal items wich apparently the cloak sword and amulet all are. Weird right? It gets better. After his betrayal he gets locked in a dungeon as a traitor. Then meets the same weird dude who gave him the cloak. Weird guy says "hey kill a GM for me" mc says "no way crazy dude" then crazy dude curses him with a death spell. Wich apparently translated to real life. Because he logs out and the same game mark is on his hand as was in the game. So now he has a week to get revenge, get his items back. Kill the guild leader that kicked him out. Oh and murder the GM, who will also die in real life when he does. Thus making him a murderer. But hey it's all good cause in the end he makes a million dollars and effectively retires and just has to play the game now.
