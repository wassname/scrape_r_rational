  Right off the bat, Harry Potter having rigid rules of magic? i think thats confusing style for substance; sure you learned the magic in a classroom and it has a password instead of "just believe", but HPmagic does whatever you want whenever you need it to. The authors core idea is very good, and HP magic violates it pretty hard: there is no source of definition of magic anywhere outside of a few vague hints.

  (None of this is critical of HP btw, its vagueness worked pretty great for the story!)

    Harry Potter magic is very limited, in a sense. In canon, you never see tricks like using *wingardium leviosa* on a person to make them run faster and jump higher, transfiguring big things into small things and then back to serve as a deadly weapon, casting *accio* on a person's clothes or wand, *aquamenti* as a propulsion engine, etc.

    I think the lack of creative use of spells is not because canon characters are morons, but because canon magic really is restricted that way. *Wingardium Leviosa* levitates objects (to levitate people you use *levicorpus*), likewise *accio* can't move something someone is holding (Bellatrix tried with the prophecy orb and failed), and you can't just accio someone's wand, you have to use the very specific spell *expelliarmus*.

    There is an inherent functional fixedness on the Harry Potter magic system.

      That is true! And you definitely cant easily define "magic" along one mechanical/mystical axis, it has multiple "traits" that it can be defined by. However, while any one spell in HP might be limited, there is always *some* spell that will do any job, because the magic has no mechanics. if you cant accio someone's person, then there is a different spell to disarm them, because the limit on accio is just arbitrary; there is no "rule of force magic" that interacts with "physical contact" or even "abstract ownership". And none of the magic generally ever builds on itself; you dont cast expelliarmus by modifying an accio charm, or combining 3 channeling techniques or whatever, you just do a different wave and say a different password.

      There are a few rules (no bringing back from the dead, no true love potions, aka classic genie rules!) but in the main the limits dont fall on any structured line. That is the meaning behind my use of the phrase "rules of magic" at least.

        > but in the main the limits don't fall on any structured line

        I agree. The rules themselves are completely arbitrary and follow no meta-rules except the meta-rule of narrative convenience.

        Other weird examples are "no making food except by duplicating existing food", and the various trumps like "fiendfyre/basilisk's venom destroys horcruxes" and "love beats Avada Kedavra".
        ```

        - u/Memes_Of_Production:

          Haha yeah, the food one is just hilarious, its not like the magic world has any farmers anyway! So its not needed to like, preserve the world's power structure (which would be a fine reason to have an arbitrary rule when telling a story about social inequality).

          i dont know if you were a big HP theorist back in the day, but the "love beats Avada Kedavra" thing was a big point of debate. Most/many people thought that it cant be *just* love, since like every mother on the planet would die to save their children, surviving AK's should be fairly common. There was therefore a lot of speculation about love being an *ingredient* in a spell Lily cast, since she was supposed to be an awesome witch and at one point, Rowling said Lily's profession would be "relevant". So there was this big fan theory edifice around Lawyer!Lily who cast some magical contract spell or somesuch, and that this sortof "love as ingredient" thing would be learned by harry and be key to defeating Voldemort.

          That theory died a very sad death on the crucible of the later books :( Such was the fate of everyone who thought there would be a "secret" to magic, or at least a kind of magic, in later books (old HPfandom rant over!)

      No, Harry almost lost the orb to Bellatrix when she summoned it.

  I'd recommend Brandon Sanderson's Laws of Magic for this:

  1. [An authorâ€™s ability to solve conflict with magic is DIRECTLY PROPORTIONAL to how well the reader understands said magic.](http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/)

  2. [Limitations > Powers](http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-second-law/)

  3. [Expand what you already have before you add something new.](http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-third-law-of-magic/)
  ```

- u/Schpwuette:
  ```
  >And if I do give magic influence over characters and the story, I force it to become a character in its own right, to mitigate the dangers of deus ex machina. 

  I've read Brandon Sanderson's laws before, and I love all that. But this is the first time I've heard anyone say something like this! To treat magic as though it were a character... I think that might be a really awesome tool.
  ```

  - u/gze:
    ```
    Brandon also said this on his [First Law of Magics](http://brandonsanderson.com/sandersons-first-law/) essay:

    > On the other side of the continuum, we have hard magic. This is the side where the authors explicitly describes the rules of magic. This is done so that the reader can have the fun of feeling like they themselves are part of the magic, and so that the author can show clever twists and turns in the way the magic works. **The magic itself is a character**, and by showing off its laws and rules, the author is able to provide twists, worldbuilding, and characterization.
    ```

    - u/FeepingCreature:
      ```
      Let's try to replace "magic" with "character" in the laws!

      > 1\. An author's ability to solve conflict satisfactorily with characters is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said characters.

      That's just good characterization.

      > 2\. "Limitations > Powers"

      This one holds up straight off without referencing magic at all. If your character is the President and also a Karate Champion and an alien space princess they're cheap wishfulfillment ("powers"), but if you actually consider how their obligations under the presidential oath clash with their duty to their space queendom ("limitations") things become interesting.

      > 3\. Expand what you already have before you add something new.

      I don't know if this fits, but if we look at how Sanderson describes it..

      > Sanderson points out that [characters do] not take place in a vacuum, a good [character] should be interconnected with the world around [them]. [They are] related to the ecology, religion, economics, warfare, and politics of the world [they inhabit]. The job of the author is to think further than the reader about the ramifications of the [character].

      Sure sounds like good advice that way!
