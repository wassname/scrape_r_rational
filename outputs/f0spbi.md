## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You're a druid. Your druidic powers are quite narrow:

  * You can massively speed up any biological process of something you touch, though it will still take the same inputs and leave the same outputs, which will be your primary limitation. If you speed up respiration too much (for example), your subject is likely to asphyxiate.
  * You can intuitively alter any epigenetic or environmental aspects of a plant or animal's growth or function when you touch it, e.g. making a flower bloom early, making a plant grow away from the light, forcing an animal into heat, etc. These alterations will persist even after you're no longer in contact with the specimen.

  How do you best use your powers "for good" in world that approximates ~1600 AD Europe, assuming that they're cool with you having magic powers? Does anything change if you're in the modern day?

    Altering epigenetics is insanely powerful, more powerful than altering genetics themselves. It's the next best thing to flat out controlling the phenotype(like plantshifting wizard) Disease genes? Silenced. Genes not optimal for the environment? Silenced. 

    Genes for crop traits we want? Over expressed. We typically have to multiply there genes we want in plants to get them to make big fruits, with all kinds of issues, you get to skip that. You can also indirectly do genetic engineering by messing with Gene inheritance epigenetics.

      You could probably turn off the myostatin gene to create super muscular people and livestock.

        That's a good idea, and we have some real life examples! Look up "Belgian Blue Cattle" and "Bully Whippets", they naturally look like they are on steroids. It's not much of an advantage for cattle though, poor feed to weight gain, birthing complications, and the meat is unique for better or worse.

    Kick off the [Green Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution) all on your own? 

    Making [high yield varieties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-yielding_variety) would be easier since you can hurry plants through multiple generations in a single growing season.

    Step one: Obtain potato.

    Step two: Cook potato. I guess this is technically optional.

    Step three: Fill your mouth with delicious potato.

    Step four: Accelerate amylase activity to the max. 

    Step five: Spit out potato-like object.

    Step six: Dissolve in water. Strain through high-grade cheesecloth to remove insoluble impurities. This step and step seven are optional.

    Step seven: Boil off water, being sure to avoid caramelization. (This isn't too hard, especially if you keep the temperature near 100 Celsius.)

    Step eight: Sell sugar at high prices.

    Step nine: Some sort of EA stuff?

    Bonus if you can train a cow to hold delicious baked potato in its mouth for long enough without swallowing. Bonus bonus if you build a complicated geometrical structure in order to touch as many cows simultaneously as is possible.

    If I'm under-educated outside of the druidic arts, then I don't know anything about the economic implications of boosting farm output, but I probably know about environmental problems caused by increasing the nutrient intake rate of the plants without laying fallow or crop rotation.

    "I wanted to do good for you all. I wanted nothing but happy, healthy, well-fed people all across the land. So, my first step was to join the church. Being able to demonstrate miracles, I was able to rise the ranks quickly enough. Many highwaymen, despite their moral faults, were loath to rob a religious leader. When necessary, I  recruited local Knights to escort me through dangerous locales."

    "For the first harvest, I made a seed bank. I had the clergymen hire couriers to all the counts and lords, to ask for seeds of their local farm varieties. I spent the year growing plants in greenhouses, and multiplying the seeds."

    "For the second harvest, I sent out a wide variety of seeds to all nearby region I could reach. I travelled the lands, following the weather, visiting towns starving due to drought or erosion, and saved them. Food isn't the only issue, wood is another huge one. I kickstarted the growth of new groves and prescribed religious significance to it, hopefully allowing the trees to grow for a decade more after my passing through."

    "From the third harvest onwards, I again sent out seeds, but this time I knew which seeds grew well, where. I began a plant breeding initiative. I send out detailed instructions on when to lay fields fallow, and when to switch from one crop to another. Everything was going perfectly."

    "But I quickly succumbed to the perils of luxury, and grew lazy. Powerful nobles and clergymen were losing their ability to control the commoners. In my quest to achieve a greater good, I assumed goodness in the hearts of my allies, and I was blind to their plots. Propaganda campaigns were launched, and despite all the good I have done, the commoners were convinced that this good was through satanic magics, to evil ends. Instead of Druid, a new word surfaced for what I do: *"Witch"* spoken throughout the land with all the contempt a false priest can proselytize.

    "I have betrayed my fellow Druids, who raised me as a child and gifted me with these magics. I have betrayed the spirits of the land, who followed my guidance to make farmlands prosperous. I have betrayed the people, good people who just want to to what they believe is right. I have ensured that, everlasting into the future, magic will be reviled because it presents a threat to the status quo. I have failed. Forgive me..."

    *This is the true and original account of the final words of the First Witch as she and her friends gathered fag for their burning. The First Witch, who brought Satan's influence upon the Christian Lands of Europe, who almost took the whole world under her sway, but was stopped by the brave actions of the Pope Eternal.*

    You could use your powers as flood abatement / swamp draining / land reclamation.  Go outside during a storm and use the wind so it doesn't asphyxiate, and if it's by a river it's in plentiful water.  You might even use that ability to clear land.  Grow weeds until they die.

  You have five years where everyone will obey you. They will follow every one of your orders as if it was an internal desire that was maxed on their 'I care about this' stat. So pretty much anything physically possible they could do, of course if you tell them to stay awake they will eventually fail and other strenous things will degrade their body.

  Don't worry about orders being confused or anything like that, as soon as someone hears/finds out about your order to them they understand the order and the spirit of it and they follow that. So a hermit in the middle of nowhere might not follow your order but if you tell people to state it on the radio everyone will follow a radio order relayed via someone else and will know fake orders from yours etc.

  What's the best way to maximise utility post-you? How much could you do to improve the world? What would be the best use of everyone's collective time?

  Presuming that you use this ability after the 5 years are up how do you stop a counterculture developing from people's reactions? Your orders all cease working after 5 years, though if you told people to smoke they'd obviously be addicted by that point and would still have to fight against that and other habits that you could have formed.

  Alternative Challenge: How do you counter this ability, with foreknowledge and without? How would you exploit the system above to disobey the orders or limit the violation of your freedom?

    "Keep healthy, work hard, make friends, and let's all do our bit to make the world a better place for everyone."

    It will *not* be hard to spread the above message very widely, especially once people realise that spreading the message is a great way to make the world a better place.

    Of course, different people will have widely divergent ideas of exactly what 'make the world a better place' will mean. But that's okay; I'm not sure that *my* ideas of how to make the world a better place for everyone are better than anyone else's, either. And anyone who can make a persuasive case that their recommended course of action will make the world a better place for *everyone* will easily recruit people to their cause.

    I don't know what the world would look like after five years. But I expect it would be dramatically different.

    Counterculture? Well, after five years of everyone working hard for a better world, I hope that the results are good enough to persuade a significant portion of the population to keep it up (perhaps at a slightly less dedicated pace).

    --------------

    Countering this ability; hmmm. Without foreknowledge seems hard. With foreknowledge?

    I guess I could try to teach people about how to be a Literal Genie, in the hope of making the Power backfire on its user (or to make the User so afraid of backfire that he is too scared to use the power).

    Alternatively, I could try to start a social movement of extreme self-denial, that encourages only doing things that you *don't* care about; thus trying to cause the people who hear the orders to instantly disregard them. (This will only be an extreme minority of the population; but if I can arrange for this Cult to be most of the people that the User interacts with, perhaps I can persuade him that he has no power).

    Alternatively, I could try to use force to physically prevent the User from giving any orders in the next five years.
