## [D] The Sixth Day

### Post:

Not really a discussion post per se, but I was watching The Sixth Day with Arnold Schwarzenegger last night and there was one thing that really bugged me. ***Contains spoilers, but it's not really a movie you watch for the plot.***

The plot of the movie is that human cloning has been invented and then made illegal - it's still routinely used to make human organs and clone pets, but it's illegal to clone a whole human being under 6th Day laws. So far so good - I can completely buy that we'd make human cloning illegal.

Here's the big problem: not only can they do human cloning, but they've also got this device that sits over the eyes and emits a flash of light, which can apparently record the entirety of your brain in the space of seconds and then store it on a disk the size of a smartphone. The visual portion of this data can then be played back like a video.

**And no one thinks of the other applications of this.** Set aside for a moment how obviously impossible the technology of getting a person's entire neural map with a single flash of light is. Forget about how stupid it is to think that a person's memory can be read as though it were a video. Just try to suspend disbelief and think about the fact that in order to clone someone they're making a human-watchable recording of every memory that person has ever had.

First off, who the hell would ever agree to be cloned if they knew that their entire being would be put onto a hard drive? Even if it weren't human-watchable, there'd be nothing to stop an amoral person from making a duplicate of you in order to torture information out of you, aside from the high cost of cloning (I believe it was $1.2 million in the distant future - the movie takes place in the year 2015). With it being human-watchable?

* Every password you had at the time of having your memory read is now suspect.
* Every telephone conversation you've ever had has been made into a recording.
* Every illegal thing you have ever done is now on tape.
* Every legal but socially questionable thing you have ever done is now on tape.
* Every private act that you did in secret can now be watched by everyone, every time you masturbated or stared at yourself naked in the mirror, every embarrassment you ever suffered, all ready to be made public.

In the movie, they put defects into the clones so that they'll have something to hold over people, but they *already have access to literally every secret that person has ever had.*

And how in the world does it make any business sense to keep that technology secret? Why aren't they offering it for use in something unrelated to cloning? Even with the security concerns inherent in giving someone access to your memories, there would still probably be a way to use it in the courts. The criminal justice system could be completely overhauled once the memory recordings could be looked at, because eyewitness testimony would actually become reliable. Spycraft just got a whole lot better, since your spies can just download their memories and have no real need for a camera to take pictures. And as far as celebrity culture goes, you don't need to worry about leaked nudes anymore, you need to worry about everyone who has ever seen you naked, because those memories can be turned into pictures (and there would of course be the inevitable porn applications).

  This is very common in (stupid) sci-fi. The author comes up with this cool plot that requires certain technology. They then stop thinking about the real implications of their technology and just write the plot they wanted in the first place.

  Just look at In Time for another example. They can extend someone's healthspan indefinitely and all they use it for is oppressing the masses. This might not be completely unrealistic, but it's probably the most boring plot you could write with that premise.

    Yup, good Speculative Fiction makes only so large a tweak to the real world that the author can explore the truly interesting consequences of it. Bad SF is a normal adventure story or romance or whatever with a shiny setting, and a MacGuffin that happens to have a technobabble name.

    That was technically a Marxist author tract.  Badly-done scifi, excellently done metaphor for the intended point.  Not sure what to think.

      I personally found the metaphor a bit too on the nose. On the other hand, I was constantly screaming: "IF YOU HAVE THAT TECHNOLOGY, WHY DON'T YOU USE TO IMPROVE EVERYONE'S LIFE." so it did reach its desired effect.

      I've headcanoned that other parts of the world makes basically everyone immortal and has started space colonization.

  Now I feel really smart about not remembering my passowrds (I write them down).

    ```
    That still wouldn't help in this scenario, if you've ever looked at your password in written format they'd still be able to pick it out of the visual record.

    Unless of course that was sarcasm in which case, carry on.

  Always remember: Any character that's supposed to be smarter than the author is inevitably going to do something that seems stupid/irrational.

  - u/AmeteurOpinions:
    ```
    That's kind of a misapplication here. This is more a case of the writer's overreaching for a plot-device to support their cloning-based plot.

  This described a lot of how I felt after watching *Robocop*.
