  Everyone keeps talking about the artifacts I like to point out the other big thing that happened this chapter. Zorian is finally throwing himself into learning mental enchantments, soul magic, and blood magic. Zorian truly the most evil resume, but now he can gain even better mind powers. Plus didn't Tinami want a way to become psychic. The Tinami ship is still here.

      True true, but only soul mages will be able to tell if Zorian made any soul enchantments, the same for mind mages and mind enchantment, and that's only if they were good enough to tell (eg natural or extremely skilled mind mages). Finally he could just claim the blood enchantments are from his witch ancestry. I know he had issues (moral or practical) with experimenting with these magics, but now he can finally get the superpowers we always wanted him to.

    I am very hyped about all the mind magic foreshadowing in this chapter. Between Zorian pulling the stops, the 'live' hydra for him to study, and the Luminous Advocates helping him integrate it all, I feel Zorian is going to change massively in the next couple restarts.
    ```

    - u/Menolith:
      ```
      >'live' hydra

      You can probably drop those quotation marks in a few chapters when he figures out how to keep the hydra alive until they get their hands on the dagger.

        That's easy. It often leaves the orb on it's own, and actually killing it is more difficult than leaving it alive. Just let it run through the jungle, then grab the knife from the orb.

    I really want a spinoff where Zorian will be the villain and Zach will be the main character but set in their regular world. On which Zorian may have had his mind shatter after taking over his real body. A Dr. Doom vibe where he makes multiple golem copies of himself. It feels like a stretch though.

  TEMP MARKERRRRRRSSSSSSSSS, Finally we might actually see character development. Waiting forever for that. Also that was brilliant, delicious irony using Ichl's tactic against him.
  ```

  - u/notagiantdolphin:
    ```
    It's a little scary how much things will accelerate. The temp markers let them accelerate their own development by leveraging everyone elses. A few more restarts and they can probably bypass the wards on the treasury entirely, so they can teleport in and take the dagger.

    They can use that to mostly guarantee four of the artefacts. Zorian got into QI's memories, so he probably knows where he starts the loop. If they knife-soulkill the pyramid wasps/Sulruthm, QI and the hydra/chameleon drakes that leaves them able to pick them up at will. That gives them four artefacts on demand, and they need only find the staff.

        IT said he 'started' to root through them. So I'm assuming he got something, from tidbits to a few full term memories. And like I said, the knife-kill of QI assumes he did get his starting location from his memories.

          Soulkilling Quatach would have a huge impact on the restarts. So much so that any new knowledge about the invasion would be utterly worthless once they're out of it. They would have no experience fighting the lich, it's possible that any high-ranking members of the Cult of the Dragon Below they targeted would react completely differently without the lich's support, and any large-scale attempts at ending the invasion in some way or other wouldn't be guaranteed to have any success outside the loop.

          Granted, it would be a great advantage to start the loop with the Crown, but they would also lose a lot in return, not the least of which is the incredible potential of trading items for Quatach's knowledge. It would seem to me like a bad idea overall, even if they did happen to somehow have obtained knowledge of where Quatach begins the restarts.

          On an unrelated note, I look forward to seeing what methods Z&Z will implement to try to reduce the impact of the Ibasans being able to summon demons during the actual invasion in the real world.
          ```

          - u/notagiantdolphin:
            ```
            Sure. But they've managed to cancel the invasion at least once with their actions, so they might not need practice fighting him. If they *do* end up deciding to fight him outside then soulkilling him would be mad. Otherwise they're just removing an enormous threat.

            It is a trade off, but I just can't see QI as anything but their biggest threat and one that they might not be able to overcome safely so close to the restart limit. Zach has already mentioned soloing other liches; he managed to kill Old Oganj pre-ZZ era. QI? It took an over-engineered battlefield and what seems like one of the world's pre-eminent telepaths smacking around his brain. And even that wasn't permanent. But YMMV, since if they cancel it this time, while the military will be on guard they won't know when the next will come.
            ```

            - u/-Fender-:
              ```
              There are three times I can think of when they greatly changed the invasion schedule. The first time was with the help of the Cyorian aranea matriarch and the memory packet she transferred every restarts, while RR was still inside the loop. The invasion still occurred, but it was just so ineffectual that it didn't succeed at causing any great damage, to the point that it was practically cancelled while RR succeeded at convincing Quatach to follow him to attack a specific academy student who apparently was responsible. This scenario won't be able to be replicated, since the next time RR gets involved by giving all the passwords and his predictions, they will also have access to demons (greatly increasing the amount of damage they can create), and Zorian no longer has the matriarch's memory packet, which gave her specific knowledge of when and how to approach whom, and who was connected to the invasion, etc. They spent numerous restarts with a whole colony of mind readers digging through the head of all important people in the region without regards for their own lives, to get that information. And it's gone.

              The second time they affected it was before Zorian teamed up with Zach, when he launched an attack against Iasku Manor along with Alanic and regiments from both the Army and the Church. They succeeded, they defeated Sudomir, the dragon and the manor's defenses. They were able to get information on the invasion because Zorian had no regard to propriety or Sudomir's well-being, and did something that Eldemar's own mind mages would not necessarily be willing to do, which was to dig deep enough inside Sudomir's mind to notice that soul magic spell he'd cast on himself to force himself not to say anything about the invasion, and make him forget it. Without Zorian's direct involvement in this, this would be unlikely to happen, and the invasion would go as planned, minus a convenient forward base and midway teleportation point for the Ibasans. And even if Zorian did get involved in Sudomir's interrogation, the only result was for the military to investigate constantly deeper, until the Ibasans felt threatened enough to have to choose either to start the invasion right away, or to abort everything. They did the invasion, and the primordial was successfully summoned. In the real world, they would have the support of demons on top of this, not to mention RR's support with his knowledge of all the passwords, so this method is also not a good way to go about it.

              And the third time I can think where Z&Z affected the invasion, and the one I believe you're referring to, is when they launched an attack on the Ibasan base under Cyoria during Quatach's temporary absence, around 2 and a half to 3 weeks into the restart, to eventually leave with the teleportation artifact. The reason the Ibasans cancelled the invasion was probably because they judged that it couldn't succeed. They couldn't summon demons, they didn't have all the passwords to circumvent wards, they lost their best method to transfer a large number of people, and either a powerful group or the Eldemar government itself was perfectly aware of their presence, to the point that they knew when Quatach left and were ready to immediately launch an assault. The reason I think that trying to replicate this would not be as easy in the real world is because: 1) they would have the passwords, which would bolster their confidence in the attack; 2) they would have demons, increasing their morale further and greatly increasing the amount of resistance the base can put out, possibly slowing down Z&Z's team so much that Quatach has time to come back; 3) it would be past the midway point into the restart, and at this point, it's likely that RR could have neutralized a lot of important people, not to mention whoever else the Ibasans will be targeting during that time when they won't be confused as to why their summoning attempts aren't working properly. 

              In the real world, the first and foremost priority will be to neutralize Red Robe before he has time to make important connections with the invasion forces and before he notices that other time travelers have left the time loop. However, he has already shown himself to be careful when it matters, so this last thing will most likely be the first thing he does. Like before, he will probably begin his restart with heading to wherever he can find one of these robes, and then immediately invading the Noveda mansion to see Zach's state. If Zach is even awake by then, he most likely won't be ready to completely neutralize RR, and this will probably end in a stalemate, where both sides are perfectly aware of the other. And where Red Robe will probably assume that other time travelers have also successfully left the loop, if Zach succeeded at doing it. So he will be fully on guard, and what he does then, and how this will impact his advice to the Ibasans,  we have no way of knowing. So in the end, Zach and Zorian have to be ready to face anything whatsoever, including Quatach. Why wouldn't RR just convince the lich to immediately try to dispatch Zach, after all? 

              Therefore, kicking Quatach out of the loop wouldn't just represent a huge loss of potential knowledge and instructions from a great teacher. It would also make them lose extremely valuable battle experience, experience which they will most likely greatly need, in a simulation that ensures that Quatach will have not the slightest bit of knowledge of what has previously been attempted while fighting him by two (or more) completely unknown opponents.

              So in my opinion, it's just not worth it. Except maybe on the very last or before last restart, where they might do it just to ensure that nothing goes wrong in their attempt to exit the loop, and when they just won't have enough time left to learn more.
              ```

                ```
                >And the third time I can think where Z&Z affected the invasion, and the one I believe you're referring to, 

                That would be the one, yes. The only one where it was out and out cancelled rather than anemic.

                >So in my opinion, it's just not worth it.

                At some point QI's going to go "Wait, *I* taught you these skills." and they'll have the same problem as they had with Alanic. The one they tried to head off with Silverlake. He also remains one of the few things that can actively threaten them, but I will admit that depends on him not feeling like he can walk all over them enough that he'll use soul magic in combat. Or if he doesn't soul-suicide-bomb in a fit of desperation should they somehow end up on the high-end of his threat scale, or if he somehow finds out about the loop from the newly inducted loopers and his rat swarms). Yes, he can teach them a lot, but the risks are very high as of chapter 85.

                (Pure speculation: Or he might get curious about why Zorian wants to get his sticky fingers into the stabilization frame around his soul for 'study' because if anybody is going to be mad enough to ask him about it, then try and duplicate that, it's Zorian. I will admit to being disappointed they didn't ask for his disintegrator ray spell (or offer to trade Alanic's golden fire spell for it).)

                 I appreciate the write-up, I'd forgotten about the demonic problem - perhaps Alanic may be one of those unspecified higher ranks that can call on the aid of Angels. Or put in a 'good word' for them with the church on the topic of maybe having a few very faithful priests nearby to assist on the day - I don't think we know enough about spiritual being capabilities yet on either side except to point it out as 'bad'. That's probably the main hole in my reasoning otherwise.

                Ultimately I think this is more of a pure value judgement in risk management on our parts rather than something we could sit down and has out 50 pages of bullshit over and come out with a mathematically perfect solution. One we probably won't come to an agreement on. You see him as worth the risk to keep practicing on and learning from indefinitely/17 restarts, while I don't, and that's from having opposite views on most points and possible contingencies.

                Possible, but Q-I seemed pretty dismissive of him even then. 

                They might manage to catch RR straight out of the loop if he goes to kill the Aranea alone. I'll laugh myself silly if it turns out to be Ibery (or a princess using Ibery as some sort of cover identity, I guess. Whatever.)

    - u/TheConstipatedPepsi:
      ```
      Zorian in particular is about to get much much more overpowered, using the dagger artifact he can study the hydra while it's docile and become mentally unified with his simulacrums, then he can use mental enhancements to accelerate his thinking speed. If you stack this with some improved time dilation chambers stored in pocket dimensions, you get a n_simulacrums * mental_speedup_factor * time_dilation_factor total improvement over normal learning speed. I think he could get 100 years of work done in the next 19 restarts.
      ```

    - u/XeL09:
      ```
      i think a few restarts will be wasted before the acceleration gets intense.  ZZ need to continue to use QI as a resource (which they must to get the crown, and possibly dagger, at all if they didn't get QI's starting location from the mind attack).  QI definitely looks into ZZ after they try to contact him and get tutoring from him.  those that are included with temp markers will be sieves of information to the cranium rats as they certainly do not have the mind magic capabilities to prevent it.  Also, mundane means of the marked people accidentally giving away information is an issue too.

      the aranea, of course, could be included without issue, but the list of humans is much shorter.  i suppose some of the temp markers may be able to cast Mind Blank (for a whole month, no less, which may reduce the number that can be continually marked) but that comes with its own problems, as its been said that using Mind Blank for too long causes up to insanity.

      the non-aranea that seem fit within the specifications would be: xvim, who might be able to contest the cranium rats without mind blank and can probably weather holding it for as long as he needs, damien, his wife and his team, as they're too far away to be a liability at the start and can just cast mind blank on themselves while in the city, any of alanic (and those he vouched for)/lukav/ilsa/nora/kyron, who could randomly have the ability and silverlake, who is also far away at the start and whose abilities are still a bit of an unknown.

      i suppose the question is how many restarts will be wasted.  this next one could end with more soul damage after attempting to contact QI and his subsequent background check which could waste 5+ more
      ```

    - u/LieutenantPoly:
      ```
      Holy shit I never even thought about the dagger, but they can't soulkill QI because they don't know were he is at the start of the restarts, so they wouldn't be able to get the crown. They also want to use the hydra so no soulkilling it either, and lets be honest they're gonna have a kaiju fight between the hydra and sand worm atleast once.
      ```

      - u/notagiantdolphin:
        ```
        Zorian got into some of QI's memories this restart. We don't know exactly what he got, but I'm guessing he might of prioritized QI's starting location. Even if he doesn't do that, and they just keep killing the hydra instead of turning it on the others - that's two guaranteed artefacts. But QI seems a bit too dangerous to leave 'alive' if they can access the crown at the beginning of the restart safely.
        ```

        - u/LieutenantPoly:
          ```
          I think this time he was just feeling out QI's defenses, but if he did manage to get QI's location than absolutely he may try to soulkill QI. That being said I think his first priority would be QI's phylactery.
          ```

  - u/LLJKCicero:
    ```
    They didn't even need Alanic/Xvim/Silverlake to fight QI this time. I mean, they're kind of cheating by preparing so many traps, but still. They're powerful as hell now, little teenage archmages.

  Ooh. I wonder what his escape plan is? Make himself a nice pocket dimension inside Zach's soul maybe and pop out that way? Or just tunnel out as a soul. The first one will need some doing to avoid setting off the marker.

  I like seeing how blase they are about things. How the ability to control a god touched hydra is merely a bit of a giggle. And that they've come so far they can stand against QI as long as they're ridiculously prepared. Given how he was at the start of MoL, it's a great illustrator of just how horrifying the old bugger is. And it's great to see a part explanation for the Cranium Rats - bothering me for a while.

  And approaching QI was ballsy. Since he developed teaching in addition to his other skills, maybe that is an endgame for Zorian if he doesn't merge with his old self. Run off to Ulquaan Ibasa to learn from the terrifying murder wizard.

    Of course, it's because Zach can solo that bug! And I think Zorian could as well if he prepared enough. Also, interesting escape plan. creating anchor upon soul is innovative. Doable?
    ```

    - u/notagiantdolphin:
      ```
      >And I think Zorian could as well if he prepared enough. 

      He's had a few restarts to get into its brain, and he knows it well enough to seriously consider starting experimenting with his own mental wonkery in that direction. He could probably just order it to bite itself to death.

      >creating anchor upon soul is innovative. Doable?

      Maybe, but it isn't physical which would make it harder than 'just' anchoring a soul to a phylactory or a pocket dimension to.. anything. Perhaps it'll be an 'imprint' that stores Zorian's soul in a dormant state for later retrieval instead, similar to Sudomir's trap. Or spits him out whole with soul. Or it could be a gate anchor on Zach's soul that doesn't need synchronization to cast, because of the time difference inherent in one of them being in the Gate. Or some sort of quasi-soul bond that doesn't actually bond them, only allows one of them to teleport to the other at will from anywhere. Zach escapes, Zorian tags along. Or makes them into a 'two souled being' - one slots into the others mind/body, but somehow keeps Zach's soul there to regulate the life force when Zorian is in charge until they can escape. Or they might just be trying to become a regular possessor entity. Entirely too many possibilities, all of them a bit crazy. Or, hell, if the gods built the machine, it's known in setting that gods duplicated people on occasion, souls included. Maybe it's a possibility to let it run down and it'll just eject copies of the 'controller' since the loop can't end while it is inside. A failsafe.

      If they go the escape route instead of actually merging, I'm looking forward to an 'aftermath' story where we get to see Kirielle's reaction, his mother and Ilsa responding to two Zorians. And maybe Taiven responding to one with a supernatural affinity for how her mind works. And the Aranae. And - well, you get the idea.  ZZ could help the Aranae start their desired equivalent of a noble house by refining their magic and psychic 'vassal techniques'. They'd even have a ready-made ally in house Aope, as long as it didn't subsume the effort entirely.

  Aw, sweet, we finally get to see Blantyre. Sad that the part that we saw was so short though. I wanted to read more about the king and angry priest.

  And we got the crown! The mana pool and the temp markers! This is a game changer, especially if Zorian can get any of them to learn enough mind magic to put their memories in the orb. Then he can just remove the memories after the temporary marker runs out and put them back in his poor friends brains.

  Also, that arm. Brutal.

      Currently they rely on QI bringing the crown to them. If they exclude QI's soul from the loop they probably won't be able to find the crown.

      They need to use the tracker on him somehow. Bring the king into the time loop, so he can just let them take the dagger to resume tracking qiick at the start of the restart.

      ```
      Well they don't need to be strong enough to win, just strong enough to stop the invasion. Hell chapter 25 Zorian straight up stopped the invasion from happening in the first place with the Cyoria Web. If Zorian can prove that he's friendly with the real Cyoria Web, introduce them to Tinami, and gather information about people high up in the invasion, then they could stop it from happening. At that point they would just have to fight Red Robe.
      ```

        - u/LieutenantPoly:
          ```
          Well if you think about it QI doesn't seem the type to do that. Ultimately he doesn't want to destroy Cyoria, he wants to play kingmaker in the next Splinter Wars. Even if the invasion fails he could just wait for when Eldemar dedicates most of it's troops than attack the capital. The only reason he's even there is because of the Cult of the Dragon Below giving him extra muscle.

          He doesn't seem the type to get angry over something ultimately pointless, plus he would recognize people as strong as Zach and Zorian would be too costly to assassinate thus being to much trouble for their worth.

          And all of this is assuming he even finds out about ZZ. Remember that when the Cyoria Web and Aope family stopped the invasion, Zorian was actively going out and killing cranium rats, and QI never paid him any mind when he attacked the dance hall. My guess is he probably only thought Zorian was a prodigy that the aranea contracted for help. (aka some cheap mercenary)

          - u/kaukamieli:

QI is honorable, but honorable from centuries ago. He has no problem with torturing captured foes, or civilians, and his "I can barely keep up with this course schedule" approach is unlikely to be unique to dimensionalism. I don't think QI would have bothered with attacks that he knew he could stop if Zorian wasn't able to block them.

          If your teacher pulled out a gun and aimed it at your head and fired, then went "Surprise, it's just a lighter", would you call that a good teacher?
          ```

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            Alanic is a good teacher because he found something that Zorian needed to know outside the scope of what he was being asked to teach, and made sure he learned the lesson. Namely, if someone looks to be trying to kill you, and you aren't significantly more powerful than them, holding back is liable to get you killed.
            ```

            - u/Ardvarkeating101:

              Except Zorian *already knew that lesson*.  He explicitly already knew that lesson and told Alanic that he did.  Even if he didn't know that lesson, *you don't bring in lethal force when the other side isn't prepared for it when sparring*.  It's like having a martial-arts self defense class and then kneecapping someone.  It's ridiculous and would get anyone fired for trying it. 

              Fortunately Zorian's immortal and Alanic doesn't have a boss.

                That's the thing, Alanic wasn't teaching self-defense there. It was purely a test to see how long it would take Zorian to respond with lethal force when presented with apparently lethal force in an enemy. (Besides Alanic's divine artifact to heal burns, he also is able to control his flames such that they don't burn something.) For the purpose of Alanic's test, that last bit didn't even matter, it was more to assuage Zorian after the fact. 

                The main thing was that he didn't know that Zorian's method of attack (mental blasts that knocked the assailants unconscious) from that fight was purely practical and not overly merciful/naive.
                ```

  - u/LieutenantPoly:
    ```
    Well he's taught people before, and he has no reason not to give them their artifacts worth. If people showed up with priceless artifacts in exchange for lessons then they could be a source of more artifacts in the future, and QI seems to like his shiny things.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Also, pissing off people who are willing to give away multiple divine artifacts, simply to deny them knowledge that can't be used to harm him, is a bad survival plan. It's beneficial for him to foster alliances with powerful mages, and screwing them over doesn't really benefit him much.

      If it was a trade for something like combat or soul magic, sure, he could be potentially harmed by strengthening the competition, but pocket dimension creation is at best only mildly beneficial to comabt.

          “Machine Learning” = ML

          The time loop is an analogy for how AI can use machine learning to become disgustingly proficient in a skill or set of skills. Computers are capable of running hundreds and thousands of simulations in the time it takes for us to do one iteration of that event. This operates much like the story’s time loop as an extreme time dilation field.

          AI can easily gain the experience equivalent to thousands of human hours through this method.
          Example: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=92tn67YDXg0

  Does anyone else suspect that this the last imperial artifact?

  Also, including all those people in the loop could go wrong horribly.

    The king's staff being the artifact may explain why he's king if lizardmen run on toughest guys in charge rules.

Daimen's team is on Koth, the aranea are masters at mental combat, and Alanics people are probably various members of the church. Taiven and the teachers are the only ones under threat, and I think that once the teachers realize this is real they're gonna play things safe.

    It's a pretty big flag, yeah, but on the other hand we also know RR is good enough at mind magic to perform unstructured attacks \(which take decades of training, according to Xvim\) and alter Zach's memory... so he might just be good enough to brainwash a royal into handing him the dagger.
    ```

  - u/Cheese_Ninja:
    ```
    Yeah, which is enough to push me in the Tesen Zveri as RR direction a little bit, since he had influence with the crown. 

    Sneaking in to the treasury get the dagger seems near impossible, and breaking in to get it draws a whole lot of attention that didn't seem to happen during the soulkill chapter. Of the named characters, he's the closest to the crown and has some of the requisite magic skills for RR. Still not my favorite choice for RR, because at this point he feels like he would be ... "boring" maybe?

  ```
  I'm curious how powerful Zorian will be if he can utilize the crown's mana battery ability to its fullest. His main problem throughout the entire story has been his low level of mana. He developed his skill with magic to the extent that he is extremely efficient in his mana use with all/most of his spells, even to be point of improving on the simulacrum spell by adding golem bodies to make it more mana efficient.  

  This makes me wonder how he would compare to a fight against Zach, if Zorian had similar high levels of mana. To my knowledge Zach hasn't bothered trying to be efficent with his mana because he has always had a monstrous amount of it. It makes me think that if Zorian had the same amount of mana as Zach, he might be able to do twice as much with it.
  ```

  - u/Ardvarkeating101:

  Would it be possible for Zorian to reverse engineer the Crown?

  In Chapter 85 we saw Zach and Zorian obtain the crown.  

  As we have previously learned, one of the crown's abilities is to be a "mana battery" of sorts.  

  All of the divine artifacts have had abilities that non-soulmarked people can use. To my knowledge, the abilities these other objects have can be reproduced with magic.  

  The Orb contains a pocket dimension, Zach and Zorian are learning how to make their own pocket dimensions.  

  The Ring has the ability of soul-sight, which Zorian has already acquired and we know it is possible for a magic user to obtain this on their own.  

  So, from this we know that the abilities of other pieces of the key can be reproduced, do you think it would be possible for Zorian to create a "mana battery" of his own?
  ```

  - u/Menolith:
    ```
    Incredibly unlikely. Didn't they say that no divine artifacts have been reverse-engineered when talking about the dagger? The knife is something Zorian has been destructively experimenting with for a long time now, and he still didn't have any clue what it was even supposed to do until the aranea told him.

    I severely doubt that Zorian would be able to make more progress on the crown, especially when he benefits immensely from having it on his person intact.
    ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Possibly, but the lich said that more mana was based on divine energy, which they can't perceive or manipulate.

    - u/thrasherfect92:
      ```
      But, doesn't Zorian excel in Spell Formula? If anyone in the story would be able to create a personal mana battery, I think it would be him and it would make up for his low mana.  

      If it is possible for him to somehow merge the mana battery theory with pocket dimensional creation (which is a huge stretch, I know) then he could create an impressive mana battery.  

      I know that it is unlikely that he will create one but, I would like to think it's possible for Zorian, with a lot of effort.
      ```

      - u/melmonella:
        ```
        A version 0.1 of such a battery could be a simulacrum stuck inside a pocket dimension with enough mana crystals to oversaturate the dimension with mana, and constantly meditating to absorb it in the most efficient manner. Though that is only going to boost his mana regeneration somewhat (I think a figure of 30% was mentioned at some point in the book, minus however much it takes to keep the simulacrum functioning), so it's not quite the same as the capacitor QI has.
        ```

        - u/Nepene:
          ```
          Meditation is a way to sidestep a lack of skill in mana gathering. It doesn't boost your mana gathering that much if you're already very skilled.

          I've said it before but the simulcrums are insanely powerful at leveraging the time he has to work with.

If his mental enhancements say, doubles his thinking effectiveness, that's 40 years of certain types of work. It's not useful for pursuing most types of goals, but imagine golems, spell formula, potions, wards and divinations 40 years ahead of the curve. That's monstrous.

Learning high level pocket dimension creation, mental enhancements, using the coin trick thing, getting the crown and dagger simultaneously, almost having the staff, fighting and beating QI with previously established mechanics, possibly getting a pet Hydra, characters persisting across restarts, etc. Things are really ramping up, and I love it.

Perhaps stealthily/legally which would indicate he's someone pretty high up, or at least connected. (since neither Zach or Zorian noticed a breaking news about the vault being broken into he would have had to do it stealthily, but there might not even be news in the first place since the govt would want to keep that quiet)

  Also I'm not sure if I'm recalling this correctly but RR was worried that there were multiple people running around with the marker. Which tells me he probably originally got the crown from the Lich and then got Zach to put a temp marker on RR.

  Also i seem to recall that the temp marker only lasts 6 months thats worth noting.

  From there RR either compelled Zach to keep reapplying the marker (which would indicate he can reliably get the crown from the Lich) or he figured out a way to sabotage the marker in such a way that it would be a permanent marker.

  For this to work though RR would have had to be an extremely competent soul mage before the time loop started. (likely came to know about Zach because Zach came to him for soul magic training) Presumably RR developed his unshaped mind magic skills because he needed to fool Zach's marker so it's unlikely he had unshaped mind magic skills before the time loop. 

  So RR is

  * Capable of learning enough unshaped mind magic within 6 months to fool a divine tool
  * An extremely competent soul mage before the time loop
  * Capable of getting his hands on the royal dagger within a single month, perhaps with help
  * Capable of getting the crown from the lich
  * Not important enough that his disappearance would cause a big disturbance in the country, unless there are extenuating circumstances
  * Capable of breaking/avoiding the connection with the divine tool that tracks everyone in the royal vault
  * Enhancements such that he can withstand getting shot without too much trouble, probably acquired in the time loop

  Am I missing/wrong about anything? Best fit I can think of is that he's a corrupt priest of some form.

    ```
    Err, he could just be Veyers like the story implies.  If he's got ties to cultists and then QI can do nearly all of the work and all issues evaporate.

    * Instead of getting the crown from QI, he just asks.
    * We know QI can break in to steal the dagger (or Veyers just groundhog attacked the Royal Family until he found a way for them to give him the dagger).
    * QI knows how to break the dagger tracking.  
    * He can have QI experiment on his soul to match Zach's marker.
    * QI is the extremely competent soul mage he has access to before the loop.
    * Veyers *does* go missing after RR disappears.
    * QI gives/teaches him enhancements.

    The mundane scenario is that Zach is spending a loop hanging out with Veyers and realizes he can talk to QI on friendly terms for once, via Veyers' contacts.  QI lets Zach use the crown under extremely controlled conditions to set a temporary marker on Veyers (after who knows how many ground-hog attempts).  Then sometime within the next 6 resets, QI copies Zach's marker onto the (presumably loyal) Veyers.  Zach thinks they'll go and be reset-buddies (like Z+Z are now), while QI thinks Veyers will come and help him escape the Sovereign Gate.  They both get double crossed.  Veyers has QI carefully fuck up everything he can with Zach's mind triggering a reset, then Veyers reneges on his deal with QI and instead of helping him uses him as a tutor over countless resets.  Sometimes he lets QI know, which is how he gets perfect plans to steal the dagger.
    ```

    - u/WalkingHorror:
      ```
      Break in is unlikely, since there was no huge uproar about it. Instead

      * the dagger is fairly useless (as we know now) and is a matter of royal family prestige, rather then national security, same as Sovereign Gate

      * just like Gate, getting it is probably a matter of jumping some bureaucratic hoops and pulling some favors up above

      * freaking head of Cyorian Mage's Guild is a cultist and maybe one of red robe mages

      As such, RR "just asks" for it after getting in on the invasion. It's just not QI he asks.
      ```

      - u/XeL09:
        ```
        iirc, zorian went the aranea immediately after waking up and suicided after his confrontation with RR so he would not have heard about an uproar about a break in.

        i'm leaning towards some sort of prince or high up priest/adviser of the royal family that humored zach and finagled himself into the loop because of the speed at which RR got the dagger to start soul killing.
        ```

        - u/GoXDS:
          ```
          as mentioned elsewhere in the thread, the soul killing was at the end of the previous loop before Zorian went back to the lair, not at the beginning of the loop of which he suicided

    - u/Xtraordinaire:
      ```
      > The mundane scenario is that Zach is spending a loop hanging out with Veyers and realizes he can talk to QI on friendly terms for once, via Veyers' contacts

      How do you picture that in terms of power dynamics? A millennia-old lich is trusting two teenagers from a hostile nation with his crown jewel artifact (pun intended)? There is no way Zach had access to a pile of divine artifacts to pay QI at that time, no way Zach was anywhere as confident in his defenses.

      > Zach thinks they'll go and be reset-buddies

      There's quite a story here explaining how Zach went from punching a guy in the teeth to being his best friend.
      ```

      - u/xachariah:
        ```
        Zach has been trying to convince everyone of the time loop for as long as he can remember.  If he successfully convinces Veyers, then he eventually gets an audience with QI to convince him.  Considering that Zach thought he was invincible back then, he might have just told QI and tried to talk him into a peaceful resolution.  Worst case scenario he just resets, right?  

        The reasoning for Zach using the crown is that he's literally the only one that can use it.  Zach wants to use it because he is aware (pre-memory-wipe) that he interacts with those artifacts uniquely and this would be his first chance to try it out, and QI wants to see it's true power used.  It's not like Zach can steal it or destroy it.  

        Veyers gets picked as the target because he'd be the only 'neutral' person in the room.
        ```

        - u/Xtraordinaire:
          ```
          > then he eventually gets an audience with QI to convince him

          And why would he want *that*? Convincing Veyers, I get. Well, maybe, given that Veyers is an unstable cunt. Convincing QI? For what gain? Most importantly, in this scenario I find it highly improbable that anyone but QI walks out alive. The instant QI learns about the loop he becomes extremely dangerous (as seen just not so long ago). 

          Probabilistically there is a better consequence of the "Zach has been trying to convince everyone" MO. Zach tries to convince (let's say) the mayor of Cyoria about the upcoming invasion. The mayor is a red robe (a high-ranking cultist, one of ~10). We know that high-level cultists have infiltrated the government (i.e. Sudomir is the mayor of KD). Once Zach tells about the invasion to one of the cultists, he is fucked. Then a red robe becomes The Red Robe.

          Is it possible that Veyers is a high-level cultist? I'd say no. His behavior before the loop is not corroborating this. The cult doesn't need him (teenager, super shitty mage, no soul/mind magic lineage)
          ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    > Capable of getting his hands on the royal dagger within a single month, perhaps with help

    > Enhancements such that he can withstand getting shot without too much trouble, probably acquired in the time loop

    These two, yes. We have evidence.

    > An extremely competent soul mage before the time loop

    Probably, yes. The marker is soul magic, so some soulfuckery was required.

    > Capable of breaking/avoiding the connection with the divine tool that tracks everyone in the royal vault

    No, not necessary. You mention the obvious scenario: RR is fully authorized to use the dagger, so he doesn't need to break the connection, so it's either the heist or the legal way, but your list is not structured to reflect this OR.

    > Not important enough that his disappearance would cause a big disturbance in the country, unless there are extenuating circumstances

    Or important enough that his disappearance is swept under the rug. Another possibility is that you are reading the loop mechanics completely wrong, and he doesn't "disappear". He is replaced with his pre-loop copy.

    > Capable of learning enough unshaped mind magic within 6 months to fool a divine tool

    > Capable of getting the crown from the lich

    No. You're making a commitment to tempmarker->permarker theory without pretty much any evidence, or even against some evidence. 

    Red Robe is a shitty mind mage, getting mind blasted by a barely trained Open (Zorian). 

    Red Robe being worried about multiple passenger loopers only indicates his method of inclusion was reproducible. Nothing more about the specifics. But it's a possibility, sure.

    I think this points to the head of the Cult, as RR. High-level cultists are also high up in the Eldemarian power structure and on good terms with the lich.
    ```

      > I think this points to the head of the Cult, as RR. High-level cultists are also high up in the Eldemarian power structure and on good terms with the lich.

      This seems likely from the evidence you listed, but the conversation between RR and QI in Ch 26 makes this feel unlikely. He calls him "little whelp" and talks about just getting rid of him because he's becoming more of a hinderance than a help. 

      "little whelp" *could* be something a thousand year old lich says about a grown (and probably rather old) man, but it's still weak evidence in favor of RR being rather young. 

      As for the "more trouble than he's worth" and "i'll kill him later" comments, that's probably not something you'd say about the person who's in charge of a huge portion of the invasion plan.
      ```

  - u/t3tsubo:
    ```
    You're missing the fact that RR can get the dagger within a few hours of the loop restarting given how quickly he soul-killed the Cyoria Web that one reset.
    ```

    - u/Cheese_Ninja:
      ```
      Actually, there's no indication that RR had the dagger when he was attacking Zorian at the beginning of that restart. He soul killed the vast majority (maybe even the entirety) the web on the night of the invasion. All that Zorian encounters after that are males, and they're still around several restarts later in chapter 41. And if there were any female aranea survivors, RR could have just killed them after Zorian died in that restart where they confronted each other.
      ```

  - u/theelbandito:
    ```
    So, each artifact has two functions. One that is the actual divine function of the artifact, and a time loop related function that you only have to physically have it one time (though the globe does not work like this for some reason).   

    The only reason to now have them all physically together is to unlock the sovereign gate to leave.   

    The knife unlocked their ability to “cast” soulkill. Now that they have presented it to the entity they do not need the knife anymore to use soulkill. Now the knife’s actual divine artifact ability is to be able to physically effect the spiritual and cut it.   

    They ring unlocked their ability to cast a tracking spell on anyone. The divine artifact property of the ring provides the ability to have a soul sense.    

    The crown unlocked their ability to cast the temporary soul marker ability on people. The divine artifact of the crown is the mana battery that they discuss.   

    The globe has the divine ability of being a memory storage device. It does not ‘unlock’ any ability like the other artifacts but the information they store in the globe stays throughout their time in the sovereign gate. The divine artifact ability of the globe is the pocket dimension itself.   

    Now as for what the staff does or unlocks I haven’t the foggiest idea. I would be interested in what everyone thinks about that.   

    EDIT: I was wrong. After looking into it more it looks like they DO need to have physical control of the artifact to use is sovereign ability.
    ```

    - u/LordGoldenroot:
      ```
      But they do need the artifacts present to use their sovereign gate abilities.

  Some of the loose ends got tied up. We know that crown has fixed capacity (not a multiplier) for sure now. I would bet that divine blessing is not a multiplier as well (it would more than double Zorians mana, but it wouldn't reach the amount Zach possesses)


  Now I'm curious if they can make gate large enough for a ship to fly through. The size was never specified and depending on that there might be some easier/harder options for Blantyrre exploration. Looking how the local lizard king they've met had held a staff as regalia - looks like the divine staff ended up owned by some local king (and one of the strongest/largest kingdoms most likely). 

  I think Zorians plan is to created dimension anchored on soul bond he and Zach will make and he will hide his soul or himself in that pocket dimension to fool the controller. 

  I think Damien will be the first one to ask for soul mark. And I'm not sure what is the plan (what the involved parties will do after markers will be close to expiring). This is going to be a huge mess.
  ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    I'm pretty sure that they can figure out a way to keep their memories - the notebook transfer was working pretty well for Xvim, Alanic, Kael, and Silverlake. All this does is extends a single restart to 6.
    ```

    - u/distrofijus:
      ```
      it is going to be different. While they know that they are being killed/recreated each restart, the experience of six cumulative restarts disappearing/just getting some memories / notes instead is going to have much larger psychological burden. There may be some workarounds like crafting memory packets and transferring them (or asking Zorian for a stuff like he did for Damien/Fortov). 


      I do think it is going to complicate things instead of making it more simple.

      good catch, per ch 82   
      "It just means we have to be smart about this. We ask him about pocket dimensions in one restart, then about soul magic in the next, then about dimensional gates and so forth. We try our best to get the most we can out of each interaction, and only when we have exhausted a full list of topics do we consider revisiting some of them. If we're pursuing a different topic each time, he shouldn't be able to notice anything is wrong."

  With all of the people that Z&Z may have recruited for 6 loops, there is a lot now that can be delegated.

  With Alanic's group, we can see a better assault on Sudomir & progress on stopping the kidnappings of shifter children.

  With Xvim & the teachers, we can see a better response on aiding the city with the upsurge in monster attacks & planning on countering the invasion.

  With Daimen's group, we can see the orb being hunted without Z&Z's aid
  hunting the orb is much quicker. Also, we may finally have progress on Daimen's magic gathering initiative in Koth.

  With the various aranea, we can see a deeper analysis into Bakora Gates (perhaps by destroying one) as well as discovering more Bakora Gates (such as on Blantyrre).

  Zorian may find more opportunities to learn from these sources as they understand his situation better.  The Filigree Sages in particular may be willing to help Zorian finally complete his learning of aranea spell formula "webcraft".

  All of these groups will definitely have a an effect on the status quo. I expect that the invasion will be completely exposed. Quatach-Ichl will definitely have Z&Z on his radar & may even kidnap one of the new "time travelers". I expect any further tutoring from Quatach-Ichl will be difficult to achieve.

Mind Magic helps a great deal. his dire situation helps a lot. time looping to gives him a ton more advantages like giving same person blueprints to improve on, knowing where and when something happens, and more
