## Bobiverse Book 3 - All These Worlds [RT]

### Post:

I've seen some discussion of the Bobiverse books here and thought it'd interest our community that the third and probably final book in the series is out!

  (Preventative typo apologies: I'm on mobile) I found it entertaining popcorn book.  I gave it a half my attention first listen through today: it has some spots with poor pacing and there is a rather glaring strawman of anti-upload ideology repeated by more than a few characters, but overall if you've read the first two you will enjoy this one.

  ```
  It's not the final book in the series. He has multiple trilogies planned.
