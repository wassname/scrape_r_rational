  I am honestly speechless. How did I not know about this earlier.. It's airing November 10. I think there has also been some pre-releases in some places - I first heard about it through a youtube movie review. But I did not know then that it was TED FREAKING CHIANG's. Someone else wrote the screenplay though. So psyched for this.

    The person who wrote the screenplay also wrote [this,](http://www.dionaea-house.com) btw. There's also been good reviews coming out of film festivals too.

      Holy shit! I remember reading that back in High School and being totally engrossed as I read through it hour after hour. Good on them for hitting the big screen!

  The story gave me chills. It's extremely well written! I'm very much looking forward to the movie adaptation, though the trailer makes it seem more "violent" than the story was.

  GAH! When I saw the trailer it reminded me of his book - I didn't realize he helped write this movie! Man, I hope it does well so Ted Chiang gets a name boost, he has a lot of fantastic stories.
