## Writing Excuses: "Writing Practical Fantasy"

### Post:

Transcript here: http://mbarker.livejournal.com/157661.html

1) think about economics
- what is the agricultural surplus?
- what is produced, how does it get to people who want it and how much would they be willing to pay for it?

2) no dumb villains. "If someone is going to be a challenge for your hero, they aren't an idiot, they may have different values, but they won't be stupid"

3) if you're going to have a "City in the Desert," at least rationalize why and how it is there (top-down story-crafting). Use the Myth-busters approach and if something doesn't work, keep adding onto it until it does. 

4) avoid "techno-porn" or the ubiquitous but irrational applications of specific toy-tech

5) "write what you know" applies even in fantasy, if you are thinking practically and rationally about real-world subjects 

6) find a group of power gamers to understand the base-rule of your system and ask them to break it. Immunize it to munchkinry.

  Writing Excuses in general is pretty great. Someone should grab all the episodes that specifically apply to /r/rational; there are ten full seasons now, all online. Every episode also has a writing prompt, which are usually pretty good, like the one for this episode:

  > You have a city in the desert. Thereâ€™s nothing around it but sand. Figure out why that city is there, how they survive and how they support all the people.

  Top-down worldbuilding is something that's quite important for this sub in particular. If you want cool laser swords and hoverboards, you need some way to justify them; some technology that explains them away, or some quirk of magic that makes this practical, economical, etc.

  Well, cities in the desert are actually fairly easy to justify.  Rivers can erode through a layer of rock and change their course, or even fail to flood at all.  Goats can eat through all the vegetation, and there are other forms of artificial desertification as well.  Human beings could have fought so many wars over that city that they salted the land around it, killing off the vegetation and desertifying the area.

  All of these rationalizations are taken from the actual history of the Middle East, unfortunately.  "Fertile Crescent", and all that.

    Right, but then you still need the support structure to keep that city alive (assuming it's not a ruin, in which case you don't have problems). The city needs to get its food and water from *somewhere*.

    Heck, you can even have a city deliberately built in the desert, like Las Vegas, so long as you have some thought put into how to explain it.
