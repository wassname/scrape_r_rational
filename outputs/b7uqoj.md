    Bro I fucking love your story, thanks for being such a fantastic author
    ```

  - u/akaltyn:

    I appreciate it. My compulsive need to read it all at once means if you release a novels worth I'm doing that for the rest of my day. And makes end of chapter cliffhangers and mysteries more meaningful. Often the details of the first few chapters of a big chunk aren't really discussed.

  Fucking fantastic chapters. Best fight scene I've read in forever. Bethel really shows her stuff, and I love the line "This creature has affronted me." Companions getting still magic is great, burning Money Rath's bones to fight it using blood magic is fantastic, Still Magic 100 for at least a day is great and potentially longer is amazing. These were totally worth all the build up.

  I love the idea that Amaryllis is better at climbing than Joon is at anything.

  Payoff for the Claret Spear was amazing. Still magic seems exactly as amazing as it seemed to be from the start, and future utilization will be neat.

  Only minor gripe is that he probably should have used vibration magic pulses to fight the bats and rats, since it's an AoE attack that doesn't need much aiming.

  Amaryllis is probably fine, as she has still magic and the Immobility Plate. Raven is likely fine, as I doubt that she adventured with Uther for years without a way of surviving large falls. Pallida may be out for a while if she dies and needs to be aged up with the time change.

  Still Magic 100 probably makes Glassy Fields achievable, since they were reasonably confident in their success when Joon was much weaker than he is now.

  Love this line mentioned in the early birds chat:

  > [I’ll check,] she said. [We’re on our way up. Don’t do anything rash.]

  > I had reached the leg that was sticking through the building and was staring straight up. Mome Rath was enormous, maybe the biggest thing that I had ever seen in person, and I was just going to, what, stab it in the face until it died?

  > Yeah, that seemed like what I was going to do.

  "Don't do anything rash" Amaryllis says.

  "I'm gonna stab the skyscraper sized monster in the face." Joon thinks immediately afterwards
  ```

  - u/Trezzie:
    ```
    Still Magic 100 plus Prince's Invulnerability makes physical threats obsolete,  as long as he's solo or people can't be blown away. 

    Oh. The stats he gets from burning bones shouldn't fade either. 

    Oh boy, get this man to a bone store.
    ```

    - u/meterion:
      ```
      Good god, he could just spend half an hour burning his own bones, soul-resetting them, and repeating until he’s gotten max stats in everything. Not to mention the BIG corpse of BIG BONES ripe for the picking. I wouldn’t be surprised if some stat has a secondary effect of letting him stay awake longer. 

      Even better, if he does take a detour to get Kenner’s eye, couldn’t he just make its “no sleep required” duration last forever? This could very well be the moment he starts to snowball into godhood.
      ```

      - u/JustLookingToHelp:
        ```
        I feel like if he starts using Still Magic 100 to go all Apotheosis, it will get excluded.  


        I'm kind of expecting Joon to get *something* excluded at some point in the story, just because it's an interesting mechanic and seeing it from the inside will explore another part of the world.  Breaking the game and spiraling up into trivializing the rest of the story seems like a candidate for that.
        ```

        - u/meterion:
          ```
          >Become god. It’s within your power. I’m not going to stop you.

          From DM's conversation with Joon way back when. I get the impression that J manages to munchkin his way into some broken build no one's figured out before (and therefore had excluded) he'll be allowed to take full advantage of it.
          ```

          - u/PM_ME_CUTE_FOXES:
            ```
            It is possible that the DM considers exclusions a perfectly reasonable obstacle that Joon needs to find a way around, rather than making an exemption for him.
            ```

          - u/GeeJo:
            ```
            Technically, the DM hasn't stopped any other ascension to date. Just contained them.
            ```

            - u/Bramble-Thorn:
              ```
              No, there are actual beings considered gods in the story, and from what we have heard they don't seem contained by the exclusionary principle like Doris Finch or Fel Seed are.
              ```

              - u/AnimaLepton:
                ```
                I'm wondering how much they're misleading us- there are 5 gods on Aerb, and coincidentally 5 dreamskewered who appeared during Arthur's time, so it's possible that those are still linked (even if they claimed otherwise)

The land of Pai Shep is now guarded by a single warrior-farmer, his fields impeccable, his power absolute.

          more likely this is what let Arthur get OP to begin with, and he's just hit the next level of challenges.  I hope it's permanent.

        END usually is sleep related, or CON. 

        Max STR, END, CON, INT, SPE, WIS, that won't actually increase skills, right? Just temporaaaaaa....rily increase the caps. On Skills. Such as Still magic. Oh.

        At least with capped stats he won't be surprised or knocked out.

        Can he still Still things on purpose to keep them even when asleep? Instinctive applies automatically, but can he still "Still" things and keep them stilled while sleeping?

          No, he can only reset his own bones via soul magic (and can't turn his bones into other bones, transplant new bones, etc etc etc).
          ```

          - u/Empiricist_or_not:
            ```
            Ah yes that's the one i'd forgotten, he said internal (to his armor I now get) and I was thinking of what he could do if he made his bones unicorn bones. Of course that's exclude!

            - u/ricree:
              ```
              Yeah, soul magic is easily one of the most OP magics in the setting. It's like 80% excluded, yet still reasonably scary.

                It's effectively giving the player admin rights over their own character sheet and those of anyone they can touch. 

                The amoral munchkin player at the table is going to ruin a lot of sessions with that power until you close the loopholes.

            He could probably reset other creatures bones if they were still alive while using them. Not necessarily a feasible solution, at least with any known useful creature, but possible.

              If they can summon and contain another Mome Rath, it'd be a great source for on-demand physical godhood.

                ```
                Even with this buff (however long it lasts), they're still short of the point where that's a good idea.

                Taking the creature down burned a number of expensive, difficult to replace resources, and even then there was a fair bit of risk and luck. They would probably succeed should they face one again (in this state), but it's not nearly certain enough to do unless the situation is especially dire (while still being amenable to summoning and fighting).
                ```

            - u/Serious_Feedback:
              ```
              By definition, anyone doing that would be a soul mage and could therefore soulfuck the unicorn he's farming bones from.

            He needs another unicorn as a pet so he could farm those bones.

    That fight was orgasmic and it read like a fun DND encounter in a nutshell. It did remind me to ask: does anyone else have any particular mood music for WTC? Just like DND campaigns are improved with fitting BGM, I've always liked reading long fantasy works with a complementary playlist that I come to associate with the story. Not in the sense of Pavlovian conditioning (because it was the music I was listening to while reading), but rather like a music director would choose fitting music for media.

    For reference, I thought [this track was a great accompaniment to the MR fight](https://youtu.be/JYFU_RiefKk). (edit: plus this [track from the same OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ma-WJUidpRU)) I haven't found a *just-right* playlist for WTC in general, but I do often listen to [this dungeon music compilation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EWYk854uIs).

    P.S. I also like the metaphorical implication of Amaryllis being so good at climbing. I never thought about it before Joon put a number to her Skill, but she really is a model workaholic. Glass ceiling, get fucked.
    ```

    - u/Grasmel:
      ```
      I dunno about mood, but the whole "fight against gigantic thing" made me think of first the [Attack on Titan theme](https://youtu.be/sdxaNeRn1GA) and then [Uninstall from Bokurano](https://youtu.be/05p646nlYS0).
      ```

    - u/erwgv3g34:

      I've been listening to ["Mello's Theme B"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jX5LHq-GYZQ) from _Death Note_ while reading _Worth the Candle_ from the beginning. The only exception is the A Cypress Waits segments, where I listened to ["Silent Ground"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZxOoFeMcxo) from _Fire Emblem_ instead.

      Normally, I have little idea what's going to be happening in a batch as I start it, so I don't do music, and the battles are normally short enough that I don't have time to queue something up.

      This time, though, I listened to [one particular song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzmZOU5hVr8&list=RDJzmZOU5hVr8) from the Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance soundtrack. It was excellent.

        ```

- u/Memes_Of_Production:
  ```
  Ok, more thought out comment! I enjoyed that the core resolution of the "puzzle" of Mome Rath didnt actually depend on still or vibration magic. They helped him get up there and survive the consequences, no question, so the quest goals clearly connected to the (sub)Boss Fight. Yet the actual key was the blood spear and bloodlines powers, which he picked up this arc by...making friends. I appreciate how its these smaller and personal connections that continually make the actual difference - those points being put into social were probably well spent, and it might continue to be a good investment.

  On a wider level, its very frequent for Mary to resent Joon for going off "impulsively", and thinking that he has no plan, and I feel like that misunderstands how thinking can work some time. Joon certainly did not have the "suck-bone-to-power-bloodlines" plan in mind when he first started climbing the leg, but he had all the parts in his mind - he knows he has multiple magics, that they will synergize \*somehow\*, and he just has to figure out the right way. This improvisational approach is often how plans in combat are going to have to work, given that its combat. I think its something she thinks can be "solved" with proper planning, but it actually cant, and going into a situation without a plan - but with the knowledge that you have enough pieces to devise one in the moment - is not in fact a bad play all the time.
  ```

  - u/sibswagl:
    ```
    To be fair to Mary, all climbing the leg got him was two burned unicorn bones and a few levels in Still Magic. If he had waited for an actual plan (rather than “start climbing, and hope I figure out something along the way”), he might’ve been in a better situation once he got up top.

    On the other hand, maybe he wouldn’t have been able to reach Still Magic 100 without those levels he got by killing bats.
    ```

    - u/Memes_Of_Production:
      ```
      I generally agree - Joon certainly isnt perfect, he could have been a bit more methodical. But the experience also gives him knowledge as well as levels - about their being mooks, about how it moves, how tough its skin is, etc. For an unknown beast like this you cant always sit back and make the plan, you learn by doing a lot. In this case he went about learning in a non-optimal way, I def admit that.
      ```

  - u/akaltyn:
    ```
    > Yet the actual key was the blood spear and bloodlines powers, which he picked up this arc by...making friends. 

    also his decision making was helped a lot by reimer's advice on the system
    ```

- u/Trezzie:
  ```
  Still Magic 100, finally, things are going to start breaking.

  Does that mean Prince’s Invulnerability is active until he sleeps?

  Oh hey, that makes Mary a dang good Still Mage till it wears off too, depending on how close they need to be!

    ```
    From Chapter 80:
    >“I got screwed on this deal,” said Fenn, folding her arms across her chest. No Symbiosis effect for her from the points I'd shifted over.

    Companions don't benefit from skill swap boosts, unfortunately.
    ```

    - u/Trezzie:
      ```
      Hmm. If he increases his mental stats that'll make the points permanent. Maybe then she will?
      ```

  - u/WarningInsanityBelow:
    ```
    Further more does the lvl 80 virtue mean he didn't lose the stats he got for burning Mome Bones? Does it mean he can burn his own bones without having to fix them afterwards? Does it mean he can sacrifice skills without losing them? I feel like this half a pun-pun build.
    ```

    - u/Empiricist_or_not:
      ```
      We all should know pun-pun build is going to come up; considering the title, how the candle is the second half of the pun pun build, not t mention the candle that was supposed to invoke Uther back at speculation . . .
      ```

    - u/Trezzie:
      ```
      I think burning bones would be a paid cost and still cause a deficit, because that's a willing paid deficit. The stilling soul would be more from memetic hazards.

  Ch 155

  * Tagging this theory because if I'm right it might be a big deal >!What if Arthur's shared universe idea was a shared universe of all their campaigns, thus aerb!<

  * The hint about the novels is probably the most substansive thing we've learned about Joon's parents other than the constant fighting. Heavily implying hardcore religious background?

  * The antimemetic effect is a really cool idea for explaining how you can have classic horror movie style villains without having to explain why noone takes the obvious option of getting help

  * What will become of a society raised in isolation based on Amaryllis's priorities?

    I don't see why this antimemetic effect prevents you from getting help.

    If you have a chain of command, anyone under you will come to back you up if you give them an order to meet you at x location prepared for a fight, gather these things, I can't say why.  (Side note: Keenan had Kel help him with antimemes on the regular).

    Unless the antimeme extends as far as to make that vague an order impossible to hear or remember.

  Getting updates to this story feels like how Juniper describes the Level Up. Minutes of uninterrupted, incredible joy- and then the downtime starts, and you turn into an evil shell of a human willing to do anything for the next chapter.

  Also:

  ***Quest Complete: Mome Rath, the Forgotten - Mome Rath has fallen, his corpse evermore a record of his existence. (This quest cannot be repeated if another Mome Rath is summoned from beyond space and time.)*** 

  I do not like the sound of *another* Mome Rath.

  Although, if Joon's progression is anything like Uther's, it won't be long til he's ploughing through Mome Raths like they're the irritating time-wasters.

  More like MOOK Rath, amirite?!
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    I actually love the sound of another Mome Rath. Tons of exp and they already know how to kill it. Plus huge bones for various uses.
    ```

    - u/SoylentRox:
      ```
      Yeah, like any RPG endgame, this is a suitable mook boss to summon to kill over and over.  With the right equipment and knowledge of all his attacks, Juniper could kill him in 5 minutes with no casualties or consumption of any irreplaceable resource like the Unicorn bones.

      &#x200B;

      Just summon him in some remote area and whack him down for the XP and loot.
      ```

      - u/blast_ended_sqrt:
        ```
        Dunno about loot, but most of the XP in WtC seems to come from completing quests rather than defeating enemies, and the quest for Mome Rath specifically says it can't be repeated.

        Even in best conditions, I wouldn't expect Joon to get more than a couple more levels out of it, and this DM seems inclined to add unanticipated complications and EXP maluses for munchkinning.
        ```

        - u/jiffyjuff:
          ```
          The bones seem useful, though. A bit big to be carrying around all the time, but I can imagine storing a few small ones in Bethel for use in case of a home invasion.
          ```

          - u/blast_ended_sqrt:
            ```
            The bones are certainly a valuable resource. Grak said Mome Rath had "novel magic" - the antimemetic effect, or something else? Either way, it might be accessible or otherwise usable from the bones. I just think the DM is going to be rather hostile to a "let's summon an elder god several times for loot" strategy, not to mention the XP rewards from future Mome Rath kills could be minimal.
            ```

              Yes but without the gigantic size, would they be more useful that normal bones?

                ```
                Who knows. At least some bonuses seem to be innate (unicorns, for example), so it's hardly unthinkable.

                Worth testing, at the least.

        - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
          ```
          Note that first level up came before "Quest completed" announcement. There are enough XP in Mome Rath's to get a level right now. Summon some more, Joon!

          - u/blast_ended_sqrt:
            ```
            I looked through the full story a while ago with ctrl+F. Funny thing, the same thing happened with Aumann before: "Aumann defeated, level up, quest complete, level up".

            In both cases, the enemy defeat finished up a level that was partially complete to some unknown degree (possibly right at the threshold of the next one). Before Aumann, Joon had been complaining about a lack of level ups for a while. Both enemies were decently out-of-depth for them at the time, and the quest objective was to deal with that specific enemy. In that case, the kills might be well-rewarded, with the bulk of the XP still coming from the quest completion - this would be my preferred anti-cheese strat if I were the DM.

            Joon's DM would probably also add extra complications to the fight if he tried to repeat it. So even if Joon _really_ needed the bones, I wouldn't expect it to work more than once more without getting horrendously difficult.
            ```

            - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
              ```
              Eh, suddenly empowering Mome Raths against bone magic seems like clumsy GMing. Better to make it so hard and dangerous (Harold) that no attempt is made the MC.
              ```

              - u/blast_ended_sqrt:
                ```
                Not giving them a defense against bone magic per se - that _would_ be quite cheap - but adding more mooks/complications that weren't encountered the first time around, that make it harder to get to the bones in the first place (which was only done the first time around through liberal use of unicorn bones and a Prince's Invulnerability). Or have something go wrong with the summoning.

                Basically, the cheese plan would be subject to the Unspoken Plan Guarantee (in effect in WtC since it makes for a better story, and in effect in-universe since it makes for a better game). It worked the first time around because we didn't know it would - but if Joon and co. tried to cheese it, both /u/cthulhuraejepsen and the DM would be obliged to throw a spanner in the works.

                  The encounter has to be made interesting if it _is_ an encounter.  The alternative is narrative time compression - a montage in cinema - where you just say, "and then we summoned several and harvested their bones."

                  Kind of like how in Vampire the Masquerade you only run feeding scenes if they're _going to be_ interesting.  That doesn't mean every feeding scene has to be interesting, just that they don't all occur on screen.

  So, Harold was dismissed as a threat by Uniquities as there were no records of his appearances ever leading to disaster. It turns out that his modus operandi is to summon an antimemetic monster that nobody can think about outside of its area of effect. On reflection, perhaps there are a lot of [Lost Cities](https://alexanderwales.com/lost-city/) out there. 

  When it comes to disasters, we should have known that Harold, of all people, would hide the pain.

  Hmm.

  If Joon forgot about Mome Rath upon arriving on Aerb because of its antimemetic properties, I wonder why Arthur knew about it to include in the list of "dream-skewered" names.

  I guess the simplest expansion is that Arthur defeated one.
  ```

  - u/Chosen_Pun:
    ```
    And then, what, hid the corpse?

    Or, wait, the quest completed text said the corpse stands as evidence, implying that the effect is broken, and people can know about it. But evidently, if one *had* been killed before, the species in general was still unknowable.
    ...So if the antimeme extends through external references, including Joon's own metaknowledge, where does it actually originate? Would the potential existence of future Momes Rath cause the party to forget this entire encounter anyway after a certain time or distance, independently of this guy's demise?

    The obvious solution, narratively, would be that defeating Harold breaks the effect more thoroughly/permanently, possibly revealing a few Mome bodies at certain disaster sites, but, still. I think the information we have contradicts Arthur killing one, and it's about as likely that the conversation with Juniper was one of the last things he remembered from Earth.

    But then that still doesn't explain why Arthur wasn't affected by the antimeme, *or* how he could transmit that information at S&S, right?
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      It's possible (even likely) that he got a virtue or entad that makes him immune to antimemes.  Remembering the conversation he had with Joon days before his death would make it a hell of a foreshadowing, in that case.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Grak says that the effect is wardable, and Uther was a warder. Maybe one day Uther warded himself against all outside magic, and that let him suddenly remember Mome Rath. And then wrote it down or something, maybe placed a permanent ward against the effect anchored to himself.

        That speech he had in the mirror is a good candidate time for it. He was sitting under "uncrackable wards" and was presumably working on the list of things to test the dream skewered with.
        ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          Wasn't there some life wards or something that just destroys anything living that touches the wards? Apply those to the flying house and fly through any Kaiju?

          - u/sicutumbo:
            ```
            Annihilation wards exist, yes. But they annihilate things with magic associated with them: blood, bone, and skin. Not muscle, organ, tendon, or ligament. It would be an effective weapon, but it wouldn't be an immediate win. Depending on if claws count as bones, which I doubt, it wouldn't even be a defense against Mome Rath's attacks.
            ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    Nah. The simplest is that the antimeme is attached to the information, not the name - knowledge and experience of the creature. It's likely that neither Harold nor Mome Rath call themselves that.

    It's included in the list because it was a good moment with his friend five days before his death and subsequent afterlife. Even if it didn't stick out all the time, it's a moment they shared on something that's deliberately utter gibberish.
    ```

    - u/Nimelennar:
      ```
      I agree that there has to be a threshold of knowledge to invoke the antimemetic effects, beyond just knowing the name (otherwise, the party wouldn't have been able to spend any time trying to figure out who/what Mome Rath was).

      But Arthur knew more than just the name:

      >“So movie two is all about the Mome Rath, this giant, skyscraper-sized beast, one that no one can think of unless he’s there.”
      >
      >“Wait, memetic?” asked Arthur.
      >
      >“Antimemetic,” I said. “Totally different. He’s got hair like fingers, he’s got --”
      >
      >“What the fuck are you even on about with hair like fingers?” asked Arthur with a laugh. He could be loud. Previews hadn’t started yet, and some people looked at us. “Prehensile hair?”
      >
      >“No,” I said. I held up a finger. “Okay, picture this finger as three links of a chain. Extrapolate that out for like, ten yards, then multiply it by a thousand. He’s got a full head of hair, like fingers.” I stopped for a moment as a thought caught up to me. “But like, randomly rotating the angle of each knuckle in his finger-hair, I guess, so that it doesn’t all go one direction.”

      Admittedly, Joon, having built the creature up to the point where it has stats and an ecology, would have more knowledge than Arthur, and it's certainly a possibility that Joon is over the threshold of "knows enough about what Mome Rath is to trigger the antimemetic effects" and Arthur isn't, but my personal feeling is that it seems, from just the above, like Arthur has plenty enough knowledge to trigger the effects.

      My guess is he got one long ago, but the anti-memetic properties of Mome Rath meant he couldn't realize that he had it. Once he got within a mile of him, it would be viewable, but he'd have to check his quest log to see it.
      ```

    - u/Green0Photon:
      ```
      I presume he already had it, so he didn't get a notification, but that's why he said he was too busy to check.

      My memory might be faulty, but at one point, didn't he get a ton of quests about dangerous things in the world? If so, he probably got Mome Rath then, missed it, and so never got it again during this fight.

      If he had the time to check, I bet it would've already been there. I'm betting on him realizing it next chapter, since Amy wondered about it in this one.

    Impact-factor, I believe. See [Chapter 131](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11478249/chapters/38858123), Raven's commentary:

    >“Impact factor analysis. It’s part of entad studies at Speculation and Scrutiny. ‘Once the metric has been applied to a sample population of entads, it becomes clear that i-factor follows a power law, with high i-factor entads being more and more rare as i-factor increases. <...> However, this difference is not accounted for by distribution of effects alone, and in fact appears to only be fully explained by a combination of usage restrictions, timing restrictions, and identity restrictions. These restrictions occur in various entads at exactly the rates necessary to ensure rough adherence to the power law, despite the distribution of raw effects following its own quixotic pattern.’ Translated, there’s some apparent force at work which limits entads such that they can’t be too strong, and it’s *not* along the lines you would expect.”

    Basically, how narratively important that entad is supposed to be.

  Amaryllis, Pallida, Raven.

  > I was blown from Mome Rath’s back, my body twisted by the blast just to the point of being mildly uncomfortable and no more. I was twirling so quickly that my brain would probably have been smeared around the inside of my skull, had Prince’s Invulnerability not protected against that. I couldn’t see anything but blinding white until I was well clear of Mome Rath, and even then, everything was whipping around so fast that I couldn’t make sense of it until I’d applied still magic to stop my rapid rotation.

  Let's take votes for who dies and who lives, and how they live.

  Amaryllis has the immobility plate. All she has to do is activate it before Prince’s Invulnerability runs out and she stops the spin, then can just float down. Her not responding on Parson's Voice means she's either dead, unconscious or out of range of "Parson's Voice, would work on the scale of miles". Which is not impossible, but seems unlikely. If she wasn't able to activate the plate before the invulnerability ran out the spin would have rendered her unconscious and the fall would likely have killed her. She could theoretically have used half of Junipers still magic to stop the spin while still flying away, but that seems unlikely when she could activate the armor with just a thought.

  The other two I'm less sure about. As far as I could tell, neither have an obvious method to stop the spin in 6 seconds, which honestly would likely kill them straight out as soon as their weren't invulnerable. And if not, it would at least knock them unconscious. I also don't think we know of any methods they have to stop long falls, but it seems likely that they both have something hidden away, which may or may not work with them unconscious.

  So most likely case from a narrative point of view, they all get blown miles away but end up being fine and just take a while to get back. That lets us worry about them while Juniper is fighting Harold, but not overusing the "companion dies when you fight a big bad" narrative too much.

  Small chance Pallida or Raven die, much smaller chance Amaryllis does.

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Nah, Amyrillis won't die, the story just can't let her, I see it as far more likely that she was punted into some wards that stop her replying with Parson's voice. I can also see her being separated from Joon for awhile, she needs some time to develop as a character away from him, she got some when the soul mage hijacked, and that was great for her character development and progression, I can see her possibly having been captured and having to break her way out without Joon's help, this would challenge her over reliance on narrative, as the idea of her breaking free on her own is counter to the idea that this is solely Joon's story, and also give her some time to think about June from a less objective and more emotional perspective.

    All of that and I will also be *supremely* pissed if she dies, like, dropping the book level pissed, Fenn's death was tragic but had obvious benefits story wise, in teaching Joon how to healthily deal with grief and changing the dynamic between him and quite a few party members, Amyrillis' death would serve little purpose but to halt the stories progression until Joon found a new motivator, as she is more or less the driving force of the party, the person with ambition and foresight, even if Joon is nominally the leader.

    This. June munchkined the blood-bone combo to ultimately win but even with those tricks he would have been smeared across the sky several times without Prince's Invulnerability and unicorn bones. Really curious to see how some archetypical 5-man party would have done it, given it was moving faster than the speed of sound and they (probably?) wouldn't be able to just kill it from the inside.

    I can think of a couple potential solutions, or maybe parts of solutions. As you mentioned, turning Mome Rath's weaponry or ecology upon itself, which they do in-story, sort of. Or managing to completely evade its notice, only killing the Bats and Rats; avoiding the red acid pores; and maybe something a next level up in terms of difficulty in the finger-hair until they find some sort of secret weak spot (although typing that out it sounds very video-gamey). Then Mome Rath isn't so much a boss in-itself but a living dungeon with a different more level-appropriate challenge awaiting at the end.

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      Imagine its hair fingers interlocking against each other in a growing clump that closes down the beast. Do some handwavy tie in to the hairy ball theorem too. You find a badly "combed" point and work from there, extending the knot outwards, finger chains interlocking to shut down whatever those hair fingers are doing for the body or it's ecology. Maybe somehow paralyzing the thing. The monster isn't topologically a sphere, but maybe its holes are where other party members come into play.

      I like this because to me "outgrabe" has four weak connotations that work well with this victory condition. First, it makes me think of grabbing, which implies the fingers should be relevant. Second, "out-" makes me think of words like "outsmarted" or "outplayed", the implication being that you've beaten the monster at its own game in some respect, extending one of its qualities beyond the norm. Third, "grabe" reminds me of "groove", eg carving or combing. Fourth, the poem says that in the beginning when everything is good and nice and mimsy, the Mome Raths are "outgrabe". Not "defeated", or "dead", or "non-existent", or anything straightforward like the Jabberwocky having its head cut through and through, but some more specific technical term indicating they are no threat. It's most tempting to see that as implying total incapacitation.

      The only other route I can see, if not utilizing either the fingers or ecology or both, would be some kind of self-powered memetic attack. Tricking the monster into forgetting what it's doing, or some such. But there aren't any obvious hooks for that.
      ```

  - u/narfanator:
    ```
    I don't think there's a canonical answer. If I was running a game like this, where I've got some very creative players with a massive grab bag of very flexible abilities, I'd just throw something crazy at them without any kind of plan at all.... after throwing at least the basic ways to fuck up player's plans (aka, mooks, etc).

    MR is a giant whatsit. Clearly the first thing you need to do is get onto it, and you're going to try climbing it, so put some obstacles there. Then, through some unknown-to-me-means, you're now on it, so, throw some more obstacles there. Finally, once you start doing anything that'll work and dealt with everything else, explosion eye beam to break THAT plan. Although I might have gone with a dog shake, or flesh that flakes off, but whatevs.

    Basically, instead of thinking up a solution and guiding players to that, block every solution you can think of and then hand your players abilities that let them out-creative you. Best way to GM, IMHO.

More or less what you described, Throwing extra complication as they come. But then I plan one single out. A clear (yet hard) path to win that they can't do without one extra bit, be it information, a person, a object or a change of terrain. It's my "Plan B".

      If they can come up with a crazy plan, that is it. If they can't and the fight drag out, I "open up" the plan B and keep pressing on adversity. The important part is that no matter if I'm railroading or not, they need to work for whatever they are going for.

    A 5 man level 20 DnD party would probably make pretty quick work of it. Nothing we saw of Mome except the limbs themselves would be 1-shot threats for high level characters, the rats can be AoEd down, especially if you have a non friendly fire point blank AoE. Once you get on top, it doesn't really have much it can throw against you. Then you just need to deal absurd amounts of damage, and you have plenty of kinetic/planar shenanigans capable of that under standard dnd rules.

      That would be breaking the law, would require bypassing protections around an artifact that's critical to an Athenaeum's existence (and would be protected as such), and may well be reconiseable, which would basically put the world's biggest bounty on Joon's head.

    In Ch 156, is Joon missing the "Double Overcapped" affliction for Still Magic?

    > There were very few game effects with durations, at least so far as the revealed text went, and I would have to touch base with Reimer to see whether there was anything he’d failed to mention, but there were at least two that I was currently under: the Skilled Trade and Overcapped afflictions were reducing my bonus to Still Magic.

    In Ch 78, Juniper explained that for "The Sacrifice" for Essentialism 100, he intended to move points from PHY and SOC to KNO and WIS "for a cap of 70 on Essentialism", although it seems like he never actually did that, so his actual soft cap on Essentialism at that time was less than 70. Then in Ch 80, when he scraped out Fallatehr's Essentialism skill and "was up in the 180s for Essentialism", he became subject to a further affliction called "Double Overcapped":

    > Scaphism came with another affliction as well, a point lost every ten minutes until they were gone, which meant that I had four afflictions eating away at my points at once, Skilled Trade, Overcapped, Double Overcapped (a larger penalty for being more than twice the cap), and Scaphism. I’d still have hours of time above 100, thanks to Fallatehr.

    If skills are "capped at three times primary or five times secondary, whichever is lower" (per Reimer in Ch 144), and Joon's highest primary attribute is MEN at about 13 (or anything less than 17) and highest secondary attribute is CUN/KNO/WIS at about 10, then he should have a soft cap of 39 to 50 on Still Magic. (Those figures based on stats reported in Ch 105 and a quick but not thorough skim through subsequent chapters.)

    In Ch 156, he started with Still Magic 21+ and funnelled 81 points into it, plus whatever skill increases he had during unicorn time, so unless his soft cap on Still Magic is over 50 for some reason it seems like he should also be afflicted by Double Overcapped (which would in turn also be stilled by Instinctive Halting and Meta Stilling).

  What a fantastic chapter! The fight against Mome Rath was a great payoff.

  Still magic 100 seems overpowered -- you can now easily get essentialism 100 back and keep it there (or another good option would be bone magic 100, with the gigantic Mome Bones).  Presumably, sleep deprivation is a physical ailment which can be relieved by bone- or blood-magic, so Joon should be able to stay awake forever -- after all, if END lets you "go on forced marches", it should let you stay awake for longer.  It would definitely be a good move for a little while to upgrade the party with souped up skin magic.

        The downside is that Joon removed Woodworking back in his first foray into his soul, so he'll need to put it back in order to put any points to it.  It looks like this should be possible by using Partial Stilling to freeze only some portions of his soul while editing the others.

    Still Magic 100 is definitely a game-changer (literally). This virtue and its force-multiplying synergy with Essentialism 20 was the axle needed to catapult him in power to match the coming challenges because otherwise he was never going to get enough levels to reach his caps naturally, with how fast threat levels have been escalating. It's almost certainly exclusion-worthy, were it anyone but Joon to unlock it (not that it'd be easy without a GUI), but I'm guessing narrative armor protects him from this.

    Harold's the one whose infected mindslaves summoned MR ("chorus is ripe"). Finch obviously didn't know about the antimemetic MR, but judging by Lartin showing up, he already knew or suspected that Harold was active in Li'o and Lartin was Uniquities' agent on the ground.

    >Repeated skilled-trades which are locked in by still magic seems like an excludable combination

    I wonder how that would be excluded though. Exclusions always seem to target specific powers or magics. Breaking the game using the still magic virtue involves several different game mechanics. What would be excluded? The simplest way to disallow it would be to just change the level 100 virtue, but, nothing like that has actually ever happened before for Juniper, he's never been penalized for exploiting the rules by the rules being changed.  The only times the rules changed were when his mind was being overidden. Other than that, he's been allowed to do what he wants with the game layer.

    It might be antimemetic in the sense that even  information based on it can't be spread, so you cant call for general help because you are doing so because of it. You "randomly" calling for help is itself information that would not exist if mome rath had not appeared.

    The antimemetic effect propagates with the signal.  The message gets sent, it's just impossible for an outside observer to perceive it.

    ```

    - u/CaptainMcSmash:
      ```
      I've already read the whole series. 

      The effect of Mome Rath doesn't seem to be as powerful, at least not how it's written. Grey's effect is powerful enough even after your dead and he's long gone, people won't notice the dead bodies (the logistics of this confuse me though). 

      But for Mome, people will still see the aftermath of his presence, the destruction and death. Even if something is scrubbing itself from your memory, if you see a destroyed city but no evidence to what caused it, you should be able to puzzle things out, like the rats and the sword, you can tell by inference. 

      If the effect only covers itself and not anything tangentially related, then messages not about it should work, such as a signal fire, or the flames of a burning city, or simply saying "come here."

      If the effect covers everything within the 1 mile range and propagates with outbound information, for instance people don't notice phones ringing, letters sent, entads used or see the smoldering ruins of a destroyed city from a distance, then this description stops making sense because this functionally means infinite range which means it should work like Grey or the one in the later story that covers the whole world. Mome slowly wiping out city after city with no evidence of anyone or anything lost until Joon finally defeated it right now. 

      But if *that's* the case, the world stops making sense. Wiping out cities would result in huge chunks of reality being jibberish. Books, maps, so many things would have chunks missing from it. Nothing about that works, so that's why I thought it had to be doing more than antimemetics to block messages.
      ```

      - u/Noumero:
        ```
        > Wiping out cities would result in huge chunks of reality being jibberish

        Maybe it's *temporary*? It antimemetically cloaks everything within the one-mile radius around it, but only for as long as it is *within* said radius: once Mome Rath enters a city, everyone outside forgets about it, but they would remember if Mome Rath exits it.
        ```

        - u/CaptainMcSmash:
          ```
          Yeah I thought about that but didn't consider it any less jibberish. Consider the following, you're looking at a picture of the mayor of New York, you know this man, he was at your wedding, you have plans to see him to discuss state issues tomorrow. A second later you either can't see the portrait or wondering why you're looking at a portrait of a stranger. You go sit down and read an article about the top 5 most iconic American cities but there are only 4 listed, strange you wonder. Several hours later you suddenly remember New York is a thing as well as the people there. There are tens of millions of people with similar stories of suddenly forgetting things that would be impossible to forget during a time frame in which New York was destroyed by some unknown force. It becomes easy to figure out what the threat is on Aerb and now you even have a way of detecting attacks; by tracking the blank spots. 

          If Mome's antimemetic ability is too powerful, it truly doesn't work. It has to be a low intensity antimeme backed up by some kind of communication blocker, but even in that case, a response by the government should be possible since there are so many workarounds and loopholes. 

          I'm really just arguing for the sake of the interesting thought at this point. I don't mind at all and really enjoyed the chapter.
          ```

          - u/Noumero:
            ```
            Hm. I'm thinking it's not just antimemetic, but... *anticognitive*.

            With antimemes, given sufficient secondary evidence, you could figure out what they do: if you see a trail of destroyed cities, you would be able to infer the existence of an antimemetic monster.

            But what if Mome Rath's deal is that not only does it erase memories of concepts, it *prevents you from figuring them out*? In that case:

            All references to the affected city/people would be suppressed, and people outside would pick *any* explanation for the inconsistency except the true one. You grabbed a blank paper by accident, the article's title contains a typo, you've never had a brother so you must have been thinking of your childhood friend instead, and so on.

            Nobody outside would ever determine that a monster is on the loose. No effective response would be possible: first of all, because you won't be able to figure out that a threat even exists; second, because nobody would notice a blind spot if they encountered one (except post-factum, which is largely useless).

            I'm sure *some* kind of response would still be possible, by a sufficiently competent government, but I don't think the text states otherwise? Said response certainly wouldn't be *reliable*, and several cities would be destroyed for sure before even a pattern would be noticed.

        Nothing wrong with this theory - That's exactly what would have happened if Joon didn't stop it. It was *just* summoned right then, so it didn't have a chance to wipe out cities previously and mess things up much. It was very legitimately a possible end of world scenario, with the world making less sense and nobody noticing.

      I'm saying it's powerset goes beyond antimemetic if it's doing that, like implausibly large area warding against communication, or reality warping or something else. I don't see how you can get those effects with just antimemetics.

        From 155:

        > they’ll simply forget that the threat exists, not just forget, but they won’t be able to puzzle it out from the evidence that’s sitting in their notebooks.

        The antimemetic effect works on induction as well. It might not literally block communication, but it prevents anyone from outside it's zone from thinking about it even in the abstract. You call someone, talk to them, describe Mome Rath only as a large creature that needs to be fought, and the person ends the call with absolutely no recollection of what happened or even the ability to deduce that there was something strange happening. The other person might even forget what you're saying as you're speaking, so they end the call because they think it's just silence on the other end, the words you're saying not even able to make into short term memory.

        If what I'm thinking Joon is implying is correct, it's a ludicrously powerful effect, but that's fitting.

        That's why he's glad that the Mome Rats have a much weaker effect. He can't notice them, but he can deduce where they are based on where he was hit from and where his weapon takes on a static form. If they had Mome Rath's full ability with no minimum range to the effect, he would be completely unable to think that there was anything off about his health points steadily dropping lower.

    I agree with this, and had the same thought. I think it \*must\* block communication, and that was simply not mentioned. Also explains how surprised Joon is at Finch showing up, since no one \*can\* be notified from the outside and he didnt know he was already present.

      From the looks of it, Finch and his team got in to the city in response to the ethics teacher's dilemma. The fact that there was an immediate kaiju attack afterward is probably a total coincidence to him.
      ```

      - u/Memes_Of_Production:
        ```
        I think it seems like he is very abreast of Harold - I think that is his primary motivation for being in the city. The ethics teacher seems obviously involved in that issue, so certainly its related. So while he isnt there for Kaiju, he is likely there for the kaiju's cause.

  > “Three?” asked Bethel. “Impressive.”

  > “One for Harold, two for Mome Rath,” I said. “Probably because they were both threats far beyond my level.” I shrugged, though I was still wired from the feeling of victory. “It worked out. Should make things easier in the future. Actually, wait.”

  Regarding meta stilling, I think its application is much more constrained than we're thinking: it refers to "game effects", and I think that must be something specific, rather than "anything that has a duration in-universe".


  Otherwise, Joon would be glowing from prince's invulnerability, the unicorn bone magic would still be active, and some of his demigod capabilities from Mome Rath's bones would still be there (he didn't spend it all against him, since he was still super fast when going for Valencia and the connection was already lost).  


  My guess is "game effects" refers to anything that has a duration specific to the game layer and which is only applicable to Joon and his companions.

  I've been guilty of not commenting on the last few chapter batches, so I just wanna thank you for your continued efforts to bring us new installments of concentrated awesome.

  &#x200B;

  I read the entire Mome Rath fight with some Shadow of the Colossus OST playing in the background and it was glorious. I'd recommend any reader to try it as well to really enhance the atmosphere! Speaking of which, I want to believe that Mome Rath also had some Colossus-like weak point somewhere along his upper surface- most likely on the back of the head or perhaps on the nape of the neck, if it's more Titan-inspired.

  &#x200B;

  I'm happy that you included another Arthur flashback scene- those have really been getting rare lately and I love them so much, so I really hope we'll be getting more of those as the story goes on.

  &#x200B;

  u/cthulhuraejepsen A question I've been meaning to ask for a while is: it occurred to me while re-reading the first chapters that critical hits and critical failures used to be a much, much more common occurrence than they are now. Is there a reason for that? Were the tutorial mechanics just different or is the game layer simply omitting them because they are less relevant as the power creep happens? I kinda miss them..

  &#x200B;

  Finally, here's the tentative Joon Companion Power Level Tier List:

  &#x200B;

  (in a standard fighting situation with little to no prep time)

  &#x200B;

  S Tier: Bethel 

  A Tier: Raven

  B Tier: Valencia, Solace (as representative of the 6E-Doe)

  C Tier: Amaryllis, Fenn (as of her last appearance)

  D Tier: Grak (sorry, our favorite warder would be much higher under a "with prep time" scenario)

  &#x200B;

  This is of course just some fun speculation and doesn't take my personal like or dislike of each companion into account! I'd welcome any further discussion on the matter.

  - u/cthulhuraejepsen:
    ```
    Game messages have been slowly phased out in general, for a few reasons.

    1. On a Watsonian level, Juniper has more or less gotten used to them, so they're phased out within the narrative because they're simply less noteworthy. They're much more likely to be mentioned in passing, rather than big and bold, as a way of reflecting that. They're part of Juniper's life, and less worth noticing, in the same way that, say, a commoner who got thrust into the position of a noble might start out remarking on all the fine clothes and fancy meals, but gradually start seeing them as background.
    2. On a Doyalist level, game messages can get really stale and wear out their welcome, which would especially be the case if every single one of them were printed out for the reader. They're best used sparingly, IMO, as part of the texture of the story, rather than as a literal (and constant) output of the story's game system.
    2. Game messages interrupt the flow of a story. *Sometimes* they can be used to heighten a particular passage or amplify the preceding paragraph, but I think it's somewhat rare, and can overstay its welcome. Part of the problem is the original formatting I chose; if I had to do it over, game messages would be italicized but not bold, so as to be less intrusive, which is something people have complained about. Another part of the problem is that game messages are typically on their own line, with in-line messages being exceptions rather than the rule, which means that any game message will usually come between paragraphs, rather than in the middle of one ... and an action paragraph probably shouldn't be broken up by one.
    3. As time goes on, there are more systems in play, more complex action scenes, more moving parts, and more things to be tracked. Juniper has a ton of virtues, entads, abilities, and applicable skills to bring to any given encounter. Since part of the prose function of game messages is to bring spice/flavor to encounters, that means that they're functionally replaced in some aspects, or that continuing to have direct output of all notifications would risk overwhelming things or making them even harder to conceptually track.

      Thanks for taking the time to write such a detailed and satisfying answer!
      It's true that in the past it got a bit distracting at times to constantly have messages such as "X person defeated" pop up during fights. However, the way you used them in this chapter to name Mome Bats and Rats was pretty neat, and then of course it always feels very satisfying to receive the notification of a boss's defeat.

      Still, a well placed crit or crit failure every once in a while might spice up fight scenes, so I hope to see them again sometime :)

  My takeaway from this chapter was mostly just how fucked Joon will be once his unicorn bones run out, tbh. He abused it a *lot*, and died a lot of times. Mome Rath was outside the difficulty curve (hence two levels), but it still seems like a bad omen that he had to savescum to bats or burn several loops trying to get Valencia to not die, and only succeeded in a way that would be impossible without the loop.

- u/narfanator:

  Huh. Depending on the force of the explosion, could Amaryllis, etc, have been blown far enough that the antimemetics kick in?

- u/GodKiller999:

  If Joon was thrown at absurd speed could he have unlocked velocity magic? IIRC the requirement was going past a certain limit for a short amount of time. It shouldn't have been reverted by the unicorn magic since his still magic wasn't.
  ```

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    IIRC he has to reach that speed both under his own power and without magic.

    Maybe if you created a rocket using your own biological by-products that would work?
    ```

    - u/GodKiller999:
      ```
      I went and checked the description

      >To become a velocity mage, you had to move, without magical assistance, faster than the benchmark, and then maintain it for a short period of time. It went up with every velocity mage that was inducted into the ranks. Due to somewhat short-sighted expansion of those ranks during the Second Empire, that meant going more than six hundred miles per hour, and there was presumably some secret to it, because that was really, really fast.

      Doesn't require to be under his own power and I don't think being pro pulsed very quickly by a magical entity would count as magical assistance.
      ```

      - u/dinoseen:
        ```
        Ah, so if you had the knowledge and the resources you could just build a normal rocket.

        As regards to magical entities, I disagree. In Aerb anyone could be described as a magical entity except for non-anima etc. If a magical entity can throw someone to create a velocity mage, then anyone with sufficient magic or entads could make more velocity mages.

        Maybe there's an extra clause to it, something like "Magical assistance, in this case, is defined as any active or passive magical effect". So then sufficiently strong non-magical beings could launch people into velocity magedom (they have latent magic, but if they're not using active or passive magic (i.e. phys buffs or entads) then it satisfies the clause and they can create velocity mages).

  Seems like the threat level just keeps escalating. I'm feeling worried for Joon and co, especially Valencia in the future. Hope nobody died from that suicide explosive stare attack by Mome Rath.

  - u/CaptainMcSmash:

    I didn't really think it was a suicide attack. Even after being debuffed through bloodline it was still only a large wound and not a deathblow. If it hadn't been debuffed, it wouldn't have been too severe probably.

    It's great. There's so many strange systems coming together and interacting. Joon puzzling though combat encounters with unicorn bones is a joy to read.

  The bit at the end with Finch seems suspicious.  Finch sent Juniper here blind, and now suddenly we find out that not only is Finch in town, and not only does he have a secret Bethel-communication device, but he also has up-to-date info on Harold?

  How does Finch even identify when someone is infected by Harold?  I mean, unless they're standing still and humming.

- u/Laptopispy:

  Correct me if I'm wrong, but no one knows how exclusions are made, right? Could Mome Rath actually be responsible for them? We know that Harold was in fact summoned by whatever magic fuckery he did, which opens up the possibility that Mome Rath appeared for a different reason. It would also explain why Arthur bothered to put it on his list of key terms, if it's that important to the world.
  ```

- u/RMcD94:

  Mome Rath, what a narrative perfect monster, I wonder if it also imbues fake memories into people that cause them to justify why they have to stay and fight it, like thinking they created it when this has to be a DM creation.

  “I can see them,” said Valencia. Her face was hidden by her red armor. “Must be magic, not information. They’re staying back.”

  I quite like the idea of author-based cinematic universes, although Joon is on kind of the wrong track imo. Or maybe the right track, if he's trying to come up with the dumbest possible. I think you could get a successful one by using an author where 1) no one individual work completely outshines the rest (scrapping Rowling and Lewis), 2) there is at least some consistency in atmosphere and genre, and 3) there is some element of magic/the supernatural (imagine a Miss Marple/Hercule Poirot crossover. Oh god.)

  Stephen King would be more or less perfect if he weren't so meta about it himself, as Arthur points out. The SKCU would just be the back half of The Dark Tower but Carrie and Mother Abigail are there. Actually, that sounds awesome. I imagine Neil Gaiman might be good? I haven't read enough of him to say for sure.

  However, if you ask me, what we really need is a Roald Dahl Cinematic Universe. I mean, you'd need to spice up Charlie Bucket a lot, he's a pretty bland dude, and Sophie from BFG needs some real character too, but Matilda, Danny(, the Champion of the World), George('s Marvellous Medicine) and Mr. Fox all squeezed into Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as they fight off The Witches? Come on, that would be amazing.
