  He kind of brushes off the whole electronics-don't-work-at-Hogwarts thing.

    Honestly I wouldn't be _that_ surprised if it was just because they got someone like Me Weasley to try and install the tech that one time :P. Most ordinary muggles struggle with technology, who's to say it's not even worse for witches and wizards.

      Yeh, one of the weirdest things about Harry Potter is how absolutely  incompetent Magical Britons are when it comes to technology. It's like magic actually damages your brain.

      Oh god, I've got it.

      HP is in the Stross "Laundry" multiverse.

        Relatively benign by the standards of the Laundryverse, though certainly the most powerful mages in HP seem to be pretty universally crazy. Dumbledore, Voldemort, Moody, Snape. They've all got their quirks.

          Maybe that's what distinguishes Wizards from normals, a natural resistance to infovores.

            Dementors fit that system quite well, less immediately fatal than vampires or succubi but they certainly steal away parts of their victims' mind.

        Ok, that does it — I’ve stumbled upon this series way too many times and put it to read “later” almost as many.

  Lighthearted and funny, but I am hesitant to claim it as fully rational. Not my work, just something I found.
