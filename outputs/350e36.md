  >Two dozen suns in a universe eight light years across. Wow! That would shrink our world into insignificance.

  Y'all have no idea.

  Not sure about rationality-content, but this is a great classic story, and if you haven't read it before, you should.

  A kind of Lovecraftian horror without any monsters or even that many fantastical elements, really.

  Has anyone ever tried to model a solar system that works like described in this story?

    > CONCLUSION

    > We have explored several aspects of Asimovâ€™s
    novel. We have found that the suns, especially
    Dovim are bright enough to blot out the stars.
    Kalgash 2 can eclipse Dovim for a period of 9
    hours.

    > We also tested one possible star configuration and
    after running some simulations, we found that the
    system is possible for short periods of time. Several
    other configurations might exist and have to be
    explored more fully.

  Aaand that was both awesome and fucking terrifying. Thanks!
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  This was also later expanded into a full-length novel that explored the themes here more fully.
  ```

  - u/PlainDealingVillain:
    ```
    But the short story is much better.
    ```

- u/Ozimandius:
  ```
  This reminds me very much of Three-Body Problem by Liu Cixin.  Definitely worth reading.
