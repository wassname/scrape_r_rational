## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  What are the best rational works written by women, or written by people from non-anglo cultures ?

  Related: please recommend or warn-away-from Luminosity.
  ```

  - u/Flashbunny:
    ```
    Is Luminosity the Twilight fic? I personally quite enjoyed it - especially the second half - but I understand it's quite divisive.
    ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    Luminosity: If you aren't interested in romance / character relationships as a focus, you probably won't love this. I personally loved it overall. There were some really interesting ideas and it was pretty well done overall. However, the sequels were ... disappointing. 

    In particular, related work Effulgence was overall not worth the amount of time I spent reading. Effulgence in particular starts off with some strong and interesting ideas and a unique format (glowfic) - they're written through roleplaying between two different authors. The format works really well in allowing 'cute' dialogue and adorable romance back-and-forth between characters. But the fact that neither of the two authors seem to be noticeably in control of the plot lead to a plot that gets pretty out of control and derails and becomes way less interesting than it's potential starts out seeming. The derailing of an interesting setup into shitty mediocrity happens repeatedly. Basically, it's all full of set-up and great ideas and no follow-through or committment to those ideas. In the end, it's millions of words that never really reach a tenth of the potential that you hope for, as intriguing set-up after intriguing set-up are always let down and deflate rather than reaching a climax.

      >  they're written through roleplaying between two different authors

      oh wow, TIL that's what glowfic means. 

      That's actually how a great deal of my on-again off-again vampire romance story is written, but I edit it extremely heavily after the fact and we'll often retcon a few lines of dialogue if we don't like where the story is going. It sounds... irresponsible for an author not to do that ? (That said, it makes the whole process take a FANTASTICALLY LONG TIME, so you know). 

      ---- 

      Anyway, thank you, I think I will give luminosity a go and then eschew the sequels !

        > I will give luminosity a go and then eschew the sequels !

        It's a difficult call to make. The first part, *Luminosity*, and the second part, *Radiance*, have different narrators, but they tell one long story. Once you finish *Luminosity*, you may find yourself wanting to read *Radiance* just to find out how the story ends. (Personally, I agree that *Radiance* is not as strong as *Luminosity*, but I still think that it is worth reading.)

        On the other hand, the third part, *Flashes*, is a collection of short stories set in the same universe and is entirely optional.
        ```

  - u/Charlie___:
    ```
    Since Alicorn's stuff is obvious, I'll plug The Steerswoman's Road series. Basically it's nice family-friendly enlightenment evangelism up until the book The Lost Steersman, which is a really really good sci-fi book that's preeetty emotionally draining.

    For non-Anglo cultures, it's a pretty high percentage, even for English language works. On the other hand, maybe you don't want to count Jorge Luis Borges or people from Norway? Forty Millenniums of Cultivation is probably "other" enough, though, so let's go with that.
    ```

  - u/Penumbra_Penguin:
    ```
    Luminosity is good quality and fun, IMO. Give it a try.
    ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    Forty Millenniums of Cultivation is a translated Chinese work. I highly recommend it, but be warned that it's anything but classy literature—expect the first few translators' work to be typo-ridden with frequent broken English.

I'd classify it as aspiring rationalism, last chapter has one of the most fantastically written battle scenes I've written.
  ```

  - u/Robert_Barlow:
    ```
    It's a little too reliant on HxH for me to really understand what is going on. But I've heard good things about it. Also
    >It's one of the most fantastically written battle scenes I've written

    Seems to be an error.

      The other guy recommeneded reading Hunter x Hunter but personally I'd recommend just watching the anime(the one made in 2012) because the manga art isn't very good.
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      You should read Hunter X Hunter. It's absolutely brilliant, and as close to rational fiction as shonen manga comes.
      ```

      - u/Veedrac:
        ```
        I agree HxH is great, though I want to note that ‘as shonen manga comes’ still means ‘not particularly rational’. As far as anime goes, I'd say it's still beaten in rationality by Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Fate/Zero, and Attack on Titan, since it still has a bunch of nonsense tropes that those three are better at avoiding. Probably the most rationalist shounen I've watched would be the first arc of Zetsuen no Tempest.

  ```
  [I would like to recommend the story I am currently writing in SpaceBattles.](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/im-made-of-stars-dc-si.762731/)

  It is a DC self-insert with a lovecraftian twist where the protagonist finds himself over the earth with a physiology that makes him look as a person made of night sky.

  My biggest influence is this sub, so maybe you guys will like it. I think the world and characters are rational so far, even if the protagonist is still off-balance, and will strive to keep them so.
  ```

  - u/Addictedtobadfanfict:
    ```
    I feel like the SI is all over the place. One minute he is calculating with no emotions and the next minute he is ecstatic for completing a dream for talking to a girl his 15 year old self always wanted. Now hes acting very immature in front of the justice league making jokes out of situations for conedic purposes.

    I liked the emotionless calculating SI that we saw the first couple of chapters and the interactions with the mage who approached the SI wanting his star essence. I wished he acted the same in front of the league but now I feel like the SI is acting like a typical OP, wish fulfilment, fix-it SI whose morals values equates to which girl has the most problems he can solve so he can add them to his harem.
    ```

    - u/Insufficient_Metals:
      ```
      The switch from pondering his own lack of attachment to the world, drives, and desires to seeking vengance for a girl he just met was so jarring I had to drop it. The inconsistency is just incredible.

      Also, taking a strange magical object from a guy that screams evil magician is just so absurdly unrational.
      ```

      - u/foveros:
        ```
        Had that reply a few times in the comments and still find it weird. "Completely lacks attachment not by choice or nature but because you just lost everyone through amnesia, and then meets a sympathetic person and becomes attached to them" is "inconsistent" to you? I'd use the phrase "logically follows".

        To the above comment, when talking to the mage he specifically mentions being in character as a mysterious being. Of course he would change his tone when around friendly persons.
        ```

        - u/Flashbunny:
          ```
          >Had that reply a few times in the comments and still find it weird. "Completely lacks attachment not by choice or nature but because you just lost everyone through amnesia, and then meets a sympathetic person and becomes attached to them" is "inconsistent" to you? I'd use the phrase "logically follows".

          It's pretty weird. Normal people don't just latch onto the first person they come across when they're feeling adrift and lacking in attachments, unless they're feeling vulnerable and looking for security, which isn't your SI's problem. They're liable to be dragged along for lack of anything better to do, but not immediately get emotionally invested.

          I'm not one of the people who dropped the story, but it definitely stood out as really weird to me.
          ```

          - u/foveros:
            ```
            What part of the text gave the "latch on" impression? The "kill the one who caused this" part? Because this wasn't caused by the woman personally, he hadn't even known about millions of people dying in an attack before they spoke. If you arrived in our earth at say 2003 and found out about 9/11 from a victim's family, would wanting Bin Laden dead mean you were latched on to this family specifically?
            ```

            - u/Flashbunny:
              ```
              The text clearly states that the SI had decided to take on killing Darkseid as his goal going forward. Even given his lack of current goals, he definitely appears to have prematurely latched onto it as a driving goal:

              >But now, I know what I am going to do.
              >
              >I am going to murder Darkseid.

              The average person, upon hearing about 9/11, did not immediately resolve to go hunt the man down personally.
              ```

      - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
        ```
        Subsequent chapters reveal an additional and very, ahem, different layer of the SI's background. They may not fully explain the SI's mood swings in the early chapters, but they suggest that Things May Not Be What They Seem (tm).
        ```

        - u/Insufficient_Metals:
          ```
          I'll have to take your word for it
          ```

  - u/nohat:
    ```
    Interesting. I'm looking forward to more. Bit confused about how he was injured by Doomsday now, but I suppose 'I cast Punch' has always been weirdly powerful in DC. If Wotan is similar to the one in young justice him getting unlimited power isn't a great thing. I did think he was a fun character so far, and kinda hope he isn't super evil.

     I would definitely enjoy him exploring the villainous side of DC verse a bit. I feel like powerful SI's in particular have difficulty with that side of things. Sometimes the justifications are just highly inadequate, or the heroes are evil dumbledored, or the SI is just cruel and impossible to empathize with. JL all seem in character so far though, and your SI is sane and has a very good reason to be wary of them.  

    I like how you have depicted the cosmic fights so far. I am wondering if you set up the cubic mind prison just so the MC matched that pic.
    ```

  - u/ahasuerus_isfdb:
    ```
    Very nice. The posted chapters are clever, well thought out and original. The only significant problem that I had was the imagery in chapters 7 and 8, which was hard to process. The author's English is quite good, but he was trying to describe an inherently challenging environment.

    Interesting premise. I'm curious where you'll take it.

  Hi, does anyone have any good examples of well done over powered characters, preferably who work there way up some kind of power ladder and end up being legendary?
  Looking for long form works like a novel series or web serial.
  ```

  - u/Veedrac:
    ```
    Forty Millenniums of Cultivation, if you're looking for a rational work and don't mind the issues of translated Cultivation novels.

    The Solo Leveling manga or One Punch Man manga/anime are fun takes on things if you're OK dropping the ‘long form works’ part of things and just want some easy fun reading.

  I just watched the Korean film *Parasite* which is being released in the US in October (but is out in much of Europe). It was very good - weird, but very good.

    Got a synopsis for it?
    ```

    - u/MagicWeasel:
      ```
      It's very hard to synopsis, but it's a dark comedy about a family who are kind of con artists and some commentary on the class divide. It's funny and interesting and shocking.

  Throwing out another request for a story in which the protagonist have the ability to permanently gain skills/abilities from others, either through copying or through conquest/stealing. I am considering an ability like that for a story but I am uncertain about whether it's possible to balance, since it seems broken for roleplaying.
  ```

  - u/-main:
    ```
    Tentatively recommending [Heretical Edge](https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/). 

    It's a major part of the setting that when our protagonist goes to monster hunter school, she learns that the monster hunters permanently gain abilities from the monsters they defeat. 

    The immediate consequences are explored: the first thing they have you do at monster hunter school is kill a small monster that consistently grants regeneration, elder monster hunters are terrifying with collections of unique abilities, etc. 

    If you like it, there's a lot of it and it's ongoing with frequent updates. 

    I stopped following it week to week. It becomes a bloated ensemble cast, and the writing isn't top quality, and it's not the most rational work.

    Are you familiar with story examples from tvtropes: [Power Copying](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerCopying), [Cannibalism Superpower](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CannibalismSuperpower), [Power Parasite](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PowerParasite), [Victor Gains Loser's Powers](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VictorGainsLosersPowers)?
    ```

      I haven't read anything. Most of the stories I find on tvptropes are uninspiring. I'm diggint through those now, do you have any particular suggestions?
      ```

      - u/onestojan:
        ```
        I don't know if I can recommend an "inspiring story". The power is rather OP, which makes it hard to write about. The incentives are set up so that it quickly turns into a battle royal or [Highlander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highlander_(film\)).

        That said give [Quicken](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/quicken-worm.369576/) (Worm fanfic) a try. Emma Barnes gains powers by killing other parahumans. 

        [Heretical Edge](https://ceruleanscrawling.wordpress.com/table-of-contents/) is centered around absorbing powers ([discussion on this sub](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7dhr5m/rtdc_heretics_edge_by_cerulean_a_magical_high/)). Takes place in an academy for future monster hunters. There are even hunts arranged for students to get powers.

        I haven't finished both, but I look forward to your story. Good luck!
        ```

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    I've not actually *written* any of the stories I've thought of that have something like this, but to me the best course of action seems to be just nerfing the shit out of it. Even so reduced, the nature of the ability makes it more than competitive over time.

    There's also a few Worm fanfics with this power. Just go on /r/wormfanfic and search power copying or something.
