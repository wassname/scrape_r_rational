## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  Looking for smart brute MC. Basically someone with a simple, physical, power contending with people with more complicated powers, like Ward's protagonist I guess. How does someone who is basically only strong and fast fight against people with the ability to control time, see the future, make unbreakable contracts, etc? Through strategy and social acumen I guess. Some weak examples would be Hunter x Hunter, Magic and Muscles, maybe Slumrat Rising? Last one's iffy.

    Almost all I can think of are Worm fanfics. Most Ward fanfics presumably count too, but I didn't like the story and haven't tried any myself.

    [Monster](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/monster.29235/#post-6121130) - Taylor has Night's power, turning into a strong and fast monster whenever no one is looking at her.

    [Centipede](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/centipede-worm-tokyo-ghoul.431353/#post-25777591) - Taylor is a cannibalistic ghoul with brute/changer powers.

    Aside from fanfics, maybe [Super Minion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/21410/super-minion) counts? The protagonist is a shapeshifter with considerable room for cleverness in how he uses his power, but ultimately is limited to physical power when going up against more overtly supernatural powers.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      Sorta disagree that *Super Minion* matches. The whole schtick is that the protagonist essentially has wisdom as his dump-stat cause he's essentially a newborn, and while he does have traits of "computational" intelligence and combat cleverness, I wouldn't really categorize him as a "smart brute". His power is also very complex, being essentially "nanomachines, son" and has a ton of flexibility

      *…And I Show You How Deep The Rabbit Hole Goes* is my favorite short story of all time, but it's not about a smart brute contending with superpowered people—it's effectively a story about a hyperintelligent person using a dumb brute's super-strength to their own end.

      - u/GlueBoy:
        ```
        I don't recall bad grammar or translation issues. In fact I believe the story was written in English. 

        The author is a huge xianxia fan and his prose is heavily influenced by Chinese webserials, but that's a stylistic choice I think.
        ```

        - u/NTaya:
          ```
          I checked the first few chapters, and the grammar is indeed bad (spelling is fine, but punctuation suffers, and certain stylistic choices are downright atrocious). Unfortunately, much of RR is noticeably worse, so this story looks good in comparison. Still, this is not something I would recommend to people who are not used to reading badly-translated xianxia. This one is obviously not translated, but emulates the horrible prose of those all too well.

    [Patriarch](https://archiveofourown.org/works/46292428/chapters/116546815) is a pretty good Mother of Learning fanfic.

    [War Queen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46850/war-queen?review=2198770#review-2198770) is an original work featuring an ant-like civilization discovered by a totalitarian human empire. The protagonist takes a rather rational approach to her grim situation.

      ```
      Derec on Patriatch. Voices of all the characters are wildly different from canon. This is more of a personal peeve though, complete canon compliance isn't necessary to a good fanfic.  


      Less forgivable is that the story acts like the time loop wasnt active as long as it was. Zorian is supposed to be decades old, an archmage, coming out of a nonstop combat simulator, and a meticulous planner. The author doesn't capture this. 


      Dumb mistakes occur like idly fiddling with a noble house secret out of boredom in plain sight and then getting caught. This isn't careful or practiced. He somehow has money troubles, despite years of locating and extracting an arbitrarily large number of treasures, that all just respawned. 


      He also feuds with his mother in some weird, off-putting "who's the better parent" contest over his little sister. Putting aside the toxicity, which makes him look like he's fifteen rather than fifty, if he was so inclined he'd be playing the model of his mom he'd developed over the decades.  


      Lots of stories have powerful characters as the focus where personal or moral problems are the main conflicts. The issue here is Zorian has known everyone around him for a long, long time. The personal problems that Patriarch throws at him are bad or trivial.
      ```

      - u/Relevant_Occasion_33:
        ```
        I thought Zorian was only in the time loop for like 10-15 years, not decades. Otherwise, I do generally agree that Patriarch is a not a good fic, I bounced off of it in the first few chapters because I found the writing awkward and not suited for the characters, and I got the sense that it would be sort of "incompetency porn" where Zorian fumbles over and over for the sake of the story.
        ```

        - u/Brilliant-North-1693:
          ```
          I think you're right and I mixed up him and Zach. Both numbers aren't stated outright afaik but Zach was in it for some decades and Zorian for plus or minus ten years like you said.
          ```

      - u/Luck732:
        ```
        Not gonna argue with all of this, but he definitely didn't model his mom's personality over decades. He barely ever interacted with his mother, by design. He has no interest in most of his family. The only family relationships he used the timeloop to improve are Kiri and Damien.
        ```

    - u/serge_cell:
      ```
      Mild disrec for Patriarch. Idiot ball was quite prominent and IIRC settings/worldbuilding weren't quite consistent. Don't remember exactly what annoyed me about settings, but idiot ball handed to traitors/antagonists was total suspension of disbelief for me.
      ```

      - u/AccretingViaGravitas:
        ```
        Tell me more about the idiot ball elements?  

        The author does deviate from canon slightly, but that's basically a premise as they mention so in their author notes, I don't think it's a writer's failure for what it's worth.  

        Edit: On reflection, the main character is an idiot about romance and I tend to skim those parts. The author seems to have this view of Zorian as being inexperienced with romance and therefore let's comic relief happen to him. I don't find that unrealistic so much as unenjoyable.

          ```

- u/EdLincoln6:
  ```
  So, once again I will ask in case more have beeen written since last time...any original fiction with reasonable, non-crazy MCs with self preservation instincts? Not Psychopath MCs, not paranoid loners, not necessarily genre savvy.  I like books where sensible people are confronted by weird magical situations and have to learn about what is going on and adapt, without jumping into a Dungeon and shouting "Yeehaw" or the story skipping immediately to the fight with the Demon King.
  ```

  - u/steelong:
    ```
    It gets posted a lot so you've probably seen it, but [Super Supportive](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/63759/super-supportive) fits pretty well. The protag has about a normal teenager's level of self preservation at first, but gets more practical once he faces some real danger.

    Perhaps [War Queen](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/46850/war-queen) counts. It's a grim sci-fi first contact situation rather than magic though.

    ```
    [Ar'kendrithyst](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26727/arkendrithyst)'s main schtick is that the protagonist is sensible, but more in a people sense rather than magic-system-mechanics sense. His first instinct after getting isekaid is to build connections with other people. However he *is* a pacifist, and it takes a while for him to understand the necessity of doing violence in the new world, and that's where a lot of people drop the story. 

    [Downtown Druid](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/79173/downtown-druid-progression-fantasy) is half a classic revenge story (>!a pastiche of Monte Cristo really!<) and half a story about the protagonist awakening a weird-ass power (in the context of his environment) and learning to use it. The protagonist *is* a criminal though, and has some specific quirks that make him a good protagonist but a not so sensible person, but overall he is very practical and pragmatic and it shows.
    ```

    - u/NTaya:
      ```
      I second Ar'k in a sense that it fits the request very well, but de-rec it on the grounds that it's not a good story. The author pretty much doesn't set up anything, especially in the first ~fifty chapters, and while there are no Deus/Devil Ex Machina, there's no suspense either. There are no events to look forward to each chapter; both the story and the  MC go with the flow. I have a hard time describing this is a way that would explain it why I outright de-rec it instead of gently warning of some mild issue, but this is the story with *the* least plot hooks in my lifetime of reading. I think this was the  first time when I genuinely enjoyed the characters and the worldbuilding—they would've been great even by tradpub standards—but still got bored out of my mind.

  HP fic rec from me the last few weeks is [What You Leave Behind by Newcomb](https://forums.darklordpotter.net/threads/what-you-leave-behind.27381/page-32#post-1070565). There’s an additional chapter on DLP, and I saw some comment about praising a pass of edits in the comments there as well, so maybe worth reading the whole thing there. 


  [Here it is on ff.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10758358/1/What-You-Leave-Behind) since that’s what I read it on, thanks /u/SpeakKindly for pointing out I linked it wrong at first!


  There’s nothing too spoilery in Taure’s review on the last DLP page, so if you want a rundown before reading check that! It is bar for bar, word for word what I would want to say about this fic. Particularly the bit about the dialog tags - Dumbledore especially. When this Albus is on screen it is a treat and a half. 


  He’s a weird fucker loaded with competency and is written exactly that way. Half his interactions end with Harry walking away like “wtf did he just say to me + did he make it better or worse?”, then 3 chapters later something clicks and it’s from that conversation with Albus. Or he shows up, does magic that is demonstrably beyond everyone except the Flamel’s, who also feature somewhat frequently, and then dips.

      He’s obviously waiting for me to finally deliver on my line by line analysis of all twelve chapters.
      While he waits, have mine.

      TL;DR

      Obviously this is a very good fic. The technical writing is top notch, for a start. We also have:

      Great magic. The magic in WYLB feels complex and academic while also leaving ample room for intuition and individual flair. It’s both serious and also charming and amusing. The various discourses regarding the nature of magic are all good, as is the use of figurative language and imagery to convey concepts which take a lot longer to explain when doing so in an exhaustive, systematic manner. The one reservation I have relates to the “embrace contradictions” and “do magic accidentally on purpose” point, but this is a matter of personal taste and there’s plenty of latitude in fanfic to take things in whatever direction you like.

      Gripping action. This is not spoken about enough in relation to WYLB. It’s a fic that really handles action very well, especially the flying sequences, but also the spider confrontation. There’s a great amount of tension, and also a good pace to these scenes.

      Strong character voices. Pretty much any main character could say a line and we’d know who was speaking without a dialogue tag (with the possible exception of Daphne). That’s pretty impressive work. How a character speaks is so tied to their personality, having these unique voices is a powerful tool in characterisation.

      An engaging character arc for Harry. Obviously, since I am writing one myself, I am a big fan of storylines in which we see Harry developing into a once-in-a-generation magical talent. His progress along this path is satisfyingly paced and well fleshed out.

      Original plotlines and genuine mysteries. Let’s see: Harry’s missing memories, Doge’s motivations and ultimate plans, finding the Founders’ rooms (and, I suspect, whether or not Lily’s journal was genuine), the Wizengamot lock on Daphne, Daphne’s parentage, Fawkes, the opening of the Chamber of Secrets… all of it fascinating, and none of it rehash.

      Scope for multiple relationships. Yes, the fic is listed as Harry/Fleur. But we know that you’re a flexible writer who is willing to change things if they feel right. Honestly, at this point the fic could easily develop into either Harry/Fleur, Harry/Cho, or Harry/Daphne. It’s always fun when a fic teases you with multiple possible relationships and encourages people to back the one they want. And the drama potential is good too: the drama that will flow from Cho and Harry sharing a kiss feels genuine and based on the well-established dynamics of the group — no poorly manufactured “if only they talked about it, there would never have been a problem” type drama here.

      Okay, with that praise done, let’s talk about the flip side:

      Author shows his hand. There are more than a couple moments in the fic where it feels like the author’s hand is seen too clearly in setting up a scene or conversation. This is especially true of the early parts of the fic: Harry and Cedric’s first conversation, or where Cho decides they should play a share-your-feelings “game”. This is largely a side-effect of needing to get through a lot of time in not-so-many words, given the 7 year scope of the fic, so it’s understandable, and fortunately it has largely dropped away now that the characters are established and therefore these relationships can develop naturally.

      Overly dystopian world. I feel like the charm of the HP world has been lost somewhat, largely because of the dystopian nature of this version of the world. I think this is a tonal thing more than a matter of fact. We have plenty of scenes of people enjoying magic and just living life, like the Quidditch scenes. But the fic establishes a dystopian tone early and doubles down on it with the “Harry’s memories” mystery. We don’t really get any sense of the world being “normal” until the Quidditch camp. As a result, the fic fails to capture that “I wish I was there” feeling that was so strong in the original HP series.

      Harry’s uncertain capabilities. As the story progresses and Harry advances with magic, we have kinda lost touch with any sense as to what Harry can and can’t do. For example, after the spider scene, when Harry was using his sock to make a scabbard, at first I thought he was casting the Undetectable Extension Charm on his sock, a NEWT level Charm. And while I thought “Oh, he can do that already?” I would not have been particularly surprised if he had done so.

  To mirror u/EdLincoln6's request, any original fiction with *unreasonable, crazy MCs with no self-preservation instincts* who are nevertheless highly competent and rational? (The way it can be made to work is if their goals and values are peculiar enough for the unhinged behavior to be optimal by them.)

  Among recent stuff that fits this niche, I could recommend [*Feng Shui Engineering*](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/reach-heaven-via-feng-shui-engineering-drug-trade-and-tax-evasion.118085/), whose protagonist is dead-set on pursuing deicidal goals no matter how suicidally reckless it is, and who makes it work through all manners of ruthless cleverness.

    [The Adventures of Rania Mortal the Perfectly Normal Elf](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/59503/the-adventures-of-rania-mortal-the-perfectly-normal), *extremely* meta story, Rania operates entirely based on genre savviness.
