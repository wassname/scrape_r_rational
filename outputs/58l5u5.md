  Not gonna lie, I was a bit hesitant on posting this here. You guys can be vicious when tearing a work apart. Still, I'm going for a Hunter x Hunter / Jojo's Bizzare Adventure feel with the fights, and I want my characters to be rationalists that unravel an interesting mystery. In a way, I'm challenging myself to be good enough to not get stumped by smart/attentive readers (i.e the people on this sub). 

  It's not as self-aware as other stories posted here, but I hope you can forgive that. I just want to write a good story and I'll take any help I can get. Thanks in advance!

  My first recommendation is that you host this on fictionpress, ao3 or another similar site, because reading a long story on Reddit is less than ideal.

    You're the second person to say the same thing. I think I'm going to put it on fictionpress.

  I really enjoyed it. I was hoping for vampires due to the Jojo's title reference but it looks like it's going to be a less disappointing version of The Magicians
