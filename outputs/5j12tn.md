  ```
  .... I'm a bit confused

  Why is sohu there before they fall in love?

  >Daughters of Jerusalem, I charge you:
  Do not arouse or awaken love
  until it so desires.

  .... the comet king had children before falling in love and his "best" child came form a different mother then the one he loved most?

  This isn't ending well is it?
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Yeah - he fathered 4 children, then stopped when he learned the prophecy.
    ```

      I meant robin isn't ending well; which well isn't saying much, archer and everything, but I think her "jealousy unyielding as the grave" with how the comet kings other children turn out may be the messy end of their relationship.

      I kinda assumed that sohu was robins dauther, but that doesn't seem to be the case at all.
      ```

  - u/Fredlage:
    ```
    He had all four of his children more or less at once, learned of the prophecy and had no more. All of that was before he'd even met Robin.
    ```

- u/Fredlage:
  ```
  If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. That ought to be a lot of kisses.
  ```

  ```
  So I guess this is what causes the Comet King's fall. Thamiel gets to her somehow.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    The Comet King just said in the chapter that it will take more than a generation before he can take down Hell. Considering how rare it is for anyone to go to heaven, then all Thamiel needs to do is to simply wait and he'll get Robin sooner or later.

    The question is whether or not the Comet King uses Robin as a pawn in his plan as a Trojan horse in Hell somehow.
    ```

    - u/fljared:
      ```
      Do we actually know that it's rare to go to heaven? Outside of Hell's dominion on Earth, its never stated what fraction goes to Hell.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        Thamiel explicitly states so in the Broadcast, and if we knew anything to the contrary than Aaron would have said so in his account of watching it.
        ```

        - u/fljared:
          ```
          >  I’m not going to say if it’s ten percent or ninety percent of you; I love to watch you squirm because you don’t know.

          That's all he says, which means anywhere between "most people go to hell" and "not that many people go to hell" is applicable.
          ```

          - u/callmebrotherg:
            ```
            I was trying to support your statement. I can see how my comment was ambiguous though. Whoops.
            ```
