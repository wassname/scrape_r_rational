  I don't know about everyone else but the Man-eating Tapirs joke just never gets old for me, I laugh every time the whole situation is referenced.

  I’m already smelling an absolutely disgusting cliffhanger on Friday. Please have mercy
  ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  The moment Akua reappeared I realized something. The Akua/Catherine arrangement is similar to the Andronike/Komena situation. Bitter enemies versus close sisters, sure, but the rest of it parallels pretty closely. You have an older, more experienced mage being bound to a younger warrior and cast more-or-less into the dark in an advisory role. You have ascension with a poorly controlled mantle to a tenuous position of quasi-godhood. You have the constant sacrifice of their people to accomplish a highly unlikely goal. They both tried to usurp Winter.

  They were both driven by the meddling of the Intercessor into things their former selves would have loathed.

  That last one, I think, will be what brings them together. They both have grievance with the third side of the game of creation, the Meddling God. Where Above and Below are bound by stories, the Bard chooses their course and makes them. Whatever she is, it doesn't appear to be driven by any of the great powers we currently know.

  And it's possible the Bard will cheer on this opposition. One of the few things we know about her for certain is that she wants to die. She makes absurdly powerful enemies of both sides, and it may be in the hopes that one of them can destroy her. Maybe Sve Noc and the Queen of Moonless Nights working together are meant to be another force for the Bard to fail against.
  ```

  - u/Law_Student:
    ```
    My read on the Bard is that she's been tasked by Above and Below with keeping their grand game on course, dealing with anything that might derail it. I don't think she's a third side at all.
    ```

    - u/Oaden:
      ```
      I think the bard is a runaway game piece. She had a task, possibly for both sides but the Tyrant implies she wants to erase "The line in the sand" entirely. I think her end game is an end to the game between good and evil, possibly through any means necessary.

      It would make some sense, her existence kinda sucks ass, and there's no escape.
      ```

      - u/Law_Student:
        ```
        If that were true she'd be on the same side as Cat and Black, and I'm not sure if that's really consistent with what she's done.
        ```

- u/TideofKhatanga:
  ```
  Making people eat their finger isn't normal, but on Below it is. Below, not even once.

  I wonder how much of these snippets of regretful memories are underlining how the alienation went (first from her Name then from Winter), and how much are hinting at something else. A new Name, closer to the fence than a Black Knight's Squire? Ascension like the Intercessor, not bound by either side? Back to nameless mortal, but armed with the knowledge that sanity and full ownership of one's own thoughts are weapons too? Red herring and I should go back to sleep?
  ```

  - u/signspace13:
    ```
    Honestly, I want her to get her power back and have a clear mind, I find it very annoying when a character loses power that they rightfully gained, especially when so much story space has been dedicated to the development of that power, I think she will get it back, but I feel like it would be very Difficult from her current position.
    ```

    - u/TideofKhatanga:
      ```
      I don't like it either but the Guideverse has firmly established that power comes at the price of sanity, with varying degree of severity. Cat breaking that would be a rather large departure from what this sub is about.
      ```

      - u/signspace13:
        ```
        I think that is the price that the gods have placed on it, all she needs to do is circumvent the gods in getting it back, something she has done before, though fairly poorly, I think she can do it, and honestly she did a decent job at resisting winter no matter what the Drow assholes think, she didn't go all ice and fury on everything, which is better than a lot of named would have done.
        ```

  - u/FeO_Chevalier:
    ```
    I don’t think her going Name-less and Winter-less is a viable option.  Too much of the story has been based on her fighting people.  Getting Winter back seems unlikely, so my money is on a new Name.
    ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  Sve Noc got the upper hand on Cat by using its motto "All Is Night". Now they're trying to shame and guilt Cat into surrendering by examining all the disputably evil stuff she did. And we all know how well that goes with her, right ? I think it has something to do with a motto of her own. It's written on her banner, even.
  ```

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    Didn't we establish multiple times that that motto was dumb and Cat was now kind of ashamed of it?
    ```

- u/BaggyOz:
  ```
  Goddamnit Akua, why do you have to make me like you so much?
  ```

  - u/Empiricist_or_not:
    ```
    Because she's got a plan again and picked her name: she picked Diabolist and I'm seeing hints of a "Devil's Advocate" and whatever it is she's effectivly been in Cats head/soul for a while learning story-fu.
    ```

  - u/FeO_Chevalier:
    ```
    I find it odd that Cat is so torn up by the whole “making a fae eat her own hand” thing (which is par for the course for Winter fae) but she doesn’t seem to have the same qualms about chumming it up with the Butcher of Liesse.
    ```

    - u/signspace13:
      ```
      When someone is the only help you have, complaining about them tends to make them less inclined to help, Akua is being useful at the moment,so instead of antagonizing her (which hmshe can do whenever) let's meet her half way for now, until her ass is out of the fire.
      ```

- u/Gr_Cheese:
  ```
  I'm not sure I like the "trial" setup the chapter ended on.

  What is Sve Noc even trying to prove here? A name from Below comes with evil baggage, that shouldn't be news to anyone. Is she trying to argue Cat is 'special'? Are we going to have a turning point when Akua shows Sve that Cat wasn't all Evil when she set up that pre-war agreement with the Grey Pilgrim? Cat wasn't going to use Devils or Demons in the first place, because she has longer term goals that don't involve nuking Harrow; she basically conned her way into a free 'No Angels' rule for the Battle of the Camps.

  What does Cat stand to gain by 'winning' this trial? The Drow don't want to settle the surface, the Drow ostensibly don't want to fight foreign wars, and Cat doesn't want Winter back. Does she help Sve Noc manage winter? Get some partial cooperation agreement? Betray the Dwarves? Migrate the Drow into Arcadia? Let's not forget, **the deal Cat hashed out with the Dwarves required Sve Noc's death**. Callow is still broke. The Drow can't pay. The Drow seem as poor as a sack of shit, assuming they'd even part with whatever possessions they have left after slaughtering each other for so long.

  If an agreement, ANY agreement, can be reached, then what could the purpose even be beyond saving the Drow population? The Drow don't even know Callow exists, the Crusade is irrelevant. Will Sve and Cat team up to fight the ULTIMATE EVIL that is the Wandering Bard? Who doesn't even have anything to do with the *current* situation and whose location / plans are unknown? Are Cat and Sve going to go on a little tromp around Calernia to bitch slap the Bard and set up the Liesse Accords because 'Oh my gawd that's such a good idea! Cat, I get it now! We don't *have* to be Evil after all! We can totally pull one over on our omniscient, all-powerful, and unknown overlords! Let's ask the crazy Tyrant in Helike for advice!' Or maybe the Bard will show up randomly and make herself relevant, just because.

  Side note: If Cat is still sticking with the name 'Liesse Accords' while speaking with Sve Noc, who has overseen an entire civilization made up of events unfathomably worse, then I declare she has gone full idiot protagonist. Completely full of herself. Same as the heroes. The only way I can imagine that going is 'Neat, can we use that against the Dwarves?' when Cat goes to explain the atrocity that inspired the name.

  **tl;dr** Fuck me for writing this. I need to have faith Erraticerrata will do this right, but these past few chapters have been a left turn away from a train wreck and do not (as they currently stand) qualify as rational fiction. Cat's acting erratically, Sve is acting irrationally, and Akua is YOLOing it as a Hero when she could have just bolted.
  ```

  - u/tavitavarus:
    ```
    To the dwarves killing Sve Noc is a means to an end: ending the Gloom to allow their armies full access to the Everdark. I doubt they really care how she does it.
    ```

- u/Locoleos:
  ```
  So... Anyone have any idea what the heck Sve Noc is actually doing here? Are they just fucking around for the sake of it or what?
  ```

  ```
  So is the Bard neutral? I thought she was a messenger for Above, but here she's answering a summons for Below.
  ```

  - u/PotentiallySarcastic:
    ```
    She's the agent of the Gods Above and Below. She's there to keep the stories running and the weed out those who try to break it. She wasn't as scared about Black as he was pretty provincial in his wants. Sure he'd like the Gods to go fuck themselves but he mainly just wants his people to stop dying in a lame attempt to please the Gods.

    Catherine is a problem. She wants to change everything on the continent.
