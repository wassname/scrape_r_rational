  There are bigger concerns than how he would conceal his secret identity.

  There's no way that one-man crime fighting would work for an ordinary human. Crimes are rare, and if you're responding to the police scanners you're going to be arriving just before them (meaning that you have lots of altercations with them) or just after them (meaning that you can't touch the criminals). Batman would never be able to effectively stop crime on a street level, though he might be able to stop organized crime in some capacity by doing detective work.

  Which brings us to the big problem that Batman has no legal authority. If you beat the shit out of some crime boss and drop him on the steps of the courthouse in some grand symbolic act, he's going to walk free unless he's already got a warrant out for his arrest. There are immense legal issues involved in arresting someone, and there's no way that what Batman is doing is constitutional. Seriously, look up the laws for making a citizen's arrest - unless the laws are different in light of Batman or the elements of his rogue's gallery, he's not legally allowed to be a vigilante, which means that it's highly questionable whether anyone he ties up is going to face any meaningful consequence, considering that their rights have been completely trampled on.

  And then there are the psychological issues that Batman has ...

  I always told myself that if I ever wrote a (possibly spiritual) sequel to my Superman fanfic it would feature Batman as the primary protagonist/antagonist. Possibly a young Green Lantern Batman - though I think maybe I just like the idea of someone intelligent exploring what the ring can do.

    I guess the question becomes what sort of thing would a badass billionaire be able to do with his money and skill to fight crime / super-villains that wouldn't be something boring like donating money to charities and the police department.

      If his goal really is to eliminate violent crime, the biggest deciding factor is just how much wealth he has that is fully and completely at his discretion, and how much more he can partially control with oversight from some board of directors (i.e. personal wealth and "Wayne Enterprises" wealth).  A fully rational billionaire with the sole goal of eradicating violent crime would recognize that physically combating the criminals themselves is a terribly ineffective way to discourage the activity compared to correcting the flaws in the socioeconomic system that incentivize it.  Basically, as sexy as a billionaire philanthropist playboy crime fighter is, it's not actually all that effective in accomplishing Batman's stated goal if the crime fighter is human (no matter how much martial training and technological toys he has to aid him).

      The most rational model for eradicating violent crime I can come up with is as follows.  With personal wealth, I would invest in dozens (or hundreds, if the wealth is great enough) of socioeconomic projects designed to "solve" behavioral economics but keep the knowledge secret.  Specifically, the goal would be varied scientific experimentation to build a robust, theoretical mathematical framework to predict human activity and decision-making on personal and aggregate scales.  Wayne Enterprises then provides an entry point into the current socioeconomic fabric to "tweak" the system over time toward the state the model predicts minimizes violent crime.  To counteract the vast expenditure of wealth Wayne Enterprises would have to expend on these tweaks, the model could also be used to concentrate previously impossible amounts of wealth back into the company (which is why it would have to be secret).

      Honestly, I don't know if any rational fiction posted on this subreddit has explored some or all of this idea because I shy away from economic fiction.  Too many people write too many assumptions into their economic models without realizing it, and thus without justifying them.  These assumptions lead to "utopia" scenarios far too easily far too often.

        I don't believe I've ever seen something like that, probably because reading about socioeconomic projects wouldn't really make for a compelling narrative fiction, and also because it seems like it would have to include a lot of intensive research. And if you do away with the rubber suit and the bat theme, you're basically just writing about a billionaire philanthropist - him being Bruce Wayne doesn't really help that much.

        But I would like to read that kind of thing, even if it was just a series of essays about economics dressed up in dialog form.
        ```

        I am pretty sure that such a project would not solve behavioral economics or remain a secret. Funding is hardly the primary constraint holding back behavioral economics. It is an intellectual challenge. Scientists are bad at keeping secrets. Money is also hard to keep secret. By its very nature, it shouts information to the treetops from whence it came.

    A technological panopticon might make it feasible, but that leaves him with a huge amount of image and audio processing and threat assessment work. Not quite AI-complete if you accept enough inaccuracy, but with only one enforcer available, you need pretty good accuracy.

    Unrelated question, but how is your next chapter coming along? Is it coming out on Sunday or before?
    ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      Still on track for Sunday, at least at the moment. Currently sitting at 6,000 words, so it looks like it will be a longer one when it's finished. Then editing, etc. But I still think Sunday is the correct date.

  According to what I've read, There are freelance crimefighters in real life. Most of them are ex-military, and they have a strict arrangement with the police that allows them to operate without causing trouble for each other or the legal system. Some of them do the whole secret identity thing (though it's kinda tenuous, since the police obviously need to know who they really are). They also have to worry about unofficial imitators; the article I read specifically quoted one of them as identifying a couple unsanctioned vigilantes and disavowing association with them and warning people to avoid them\*.

  So, yeah, in real life, Batman would need to avoid the whole secrecy thing and get official sanctioning. The canonical explanation for why he doesn't is that the Gotham City Police Department is hopelessly corrupt, but someone like Bruce Wane could probably get sanctioning from higher up--the county sheriff, the state governor, the feds whoever--and suddenly the legal system is on his side and he can actually drop criminals off at the courthouse and expect results. His tactics would most likely come under review if criminals complained too much, and he might find himself having to buy his way out of unwanted (but probably necessary) psychiatric attention.

  \* although this kinda reeks of signalling and tribal politics and ass-covering.

  \*\* But it's entirely possible my sources were BS. This was a few years ago, but I might be able to dig them up and figure out where I went hopelessly wrong if necessary.

  The biggest problem I have with this is that it assumes Batman operates in exactly the same way - it transposes the character to the real world, instead of translating the story into the real world.  

  And when you've got a genius billionaire driven by revenge... well, it could go well if he decides a spot of class war is in order to eliminate the poverty that causes muggings.  Or it could go very, very dark.

  How have I never heard of that sub before?!

  More relevant to people who are not me: why the hell is it not in the list of related subreddits in /r/rational's sidebar? It may as well be called /createyourowndeconstruciton!
