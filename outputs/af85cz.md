## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  **Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 6: Zinc**

  And we're back! This is week six of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries,  for general overview of the magic system, see [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/). I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting. Parts 2 through 5 can be found here: [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a23pe3/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/eauwn90/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a4be9x/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebcx4eg/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a6ftyl/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ebuo08h/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/a8lgsu/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ecbqhr8/).

  *Spoiler note*: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

  This weeks metal is zinc. As always I'm interested in what a zinc twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

  **Allomancy**

  Allomantically, zinc closely mirrors brass. Where brass allomancers can weaken (soothe) emotions, zinc allomancers can intensify (riot) emotions. An allomancer burning zinc can focus on a person or a group of people to increase the intensity of the emotions those people are feeling. Rioters can riot all emotions at once (which causes the target to become anxious and stressed) or pick one or more individual emotions to riot.

  What counts as an emotion for Allomancy is fairly broad, it includes things like fear, anger and happiness, but also hunger, pride, feelings of loyalty and even someone's sense of fatigue. Note that loyalty here means a generic feeling of being loyal, it does not allow you to pick and choose whom the target is loyal to.

  This ability is not mind control, zinc allomancers have to be subtle if they want to use their abilities to influence unwilling targets. Once someone catches on that you are playing with their emotions it is fairly easy for them to resist it.

  While zinc does not allow you to lower the intensity of emotions, skilful allomancers can achieve a similar effect by subtly rioting other emotions that are vying for the targets attention. If you want them to overcome their fear, for instance, you could riot the targets anger and pride, making their fear stand out less.

  One other thing that perhaps goes without saying, but while the effects of allomancy are temporary, you can still use it to influence what people are thinking in the long run. For instance, if you want someone to freak out about some new piece of information, you can riot their fear and anger while you tell them about it. Then once they remember the conversation after the allomantic effects have worn off, they will remember being angry about it and the brain's desire for consistency might kick in and justify their reaction by making up some kind of reason why the things you told them were a big deal.

  The maximum number of people you can influence at a time is dependent on your skill as an allomancer, but a rough upper bound might be a large room full of people. You do not strictly need line of sight to your targets, but it does make things easier.

  Any aluminium placed between your center of mass and the targets head prevents you from targeting their emotions and extremely strong emotions in the target can interfere with (though not outright block) your abilities. Non-humans are susceptible to soothing to an extent directly proportional to their level of sapience (so you're not going to riot an ant, but you might be able to riot a gorilla or a dolphin or even a particularly smart dog).

  **Feruchemy**

  Feruchemic zinc allows you to store mental speed. When storing mental speed, a feruchemist becomes slow to react and make decisions. Completing every day tasks becomes harder and keeping a coherent train of thoughts becomes very difficult. For instance, a feruchemist storing mental speed while drinking soup might take a second to realize that in order to move the soup to their mouth, they first need to scoop it up with their spoon. Their body is no less capable, but because their reaction time is so slow, they often come across as confused, sluggish and not quite there.

  When tapping the resulting metal mind, the feruchemist becomes capable of making deductions and drawing conclusions in record time and their reaction time becomes vastly higher. It's not quite watching the world go by in slow motion (that's more feruchemic steel's thing), you just need less time to figure things out. For instance, a zinc feruchemist _can_ actually think through the consequences of their discussion partners arguments on the spot and come up with counterarguments (or be convinced) in real time. 

  Worth noting that having a higher mental speed is not exactly the same as being smarter. If you can't solve some particular mystery or puzzle given enough, tapping zinc isn't going to help. It's just that if you could solve it, tapping zinc helps you with the "given enough time" part.

    Having limitless mental speed is clearly broken beyond belief and could easily catapult the user to a position of significant power and influence incredibly rapidly, just through superhuman social-fu.

    Just feruchemical Zinc is incredibly powerful, though. If you spend all of your private time storing, you could do a pretty decent Zinc compounder impression in public. Even increasing your speed by 50% while in public would be a massive boon. This is a power which allows you to save a valuable resource you aren't using for later, even moreso than most other Feruchemical arts.

    Zinc allomancers can open successful restaurants with little work. Just amplify the hunger of everyone near your restaurant, and stop only after they finish eating your food.

    But if making money is your goal, there's a better method: horse racing.

    Bet on a horse, then amplify the feelings of fatigue felt by all of the other horses. Since they are horses, they won't understand that their feelings are being manipulated by an outside force and won't resist the fatigue. And horses, considering their ability to be trained in various ways, are definitely sapient enough for fatigue to be rioted. You will be able to win money with ease and become filthy rich.

    Probably contrary to most other people, but I don't think tapping zinc would be that powerful. You'd do better on an IQ test, but only in the pattern recognition and quick math parts. Being able to instantly come up with consequences for events is good for chess, but in real life you don't have a hard time limit like that and don't get very much of a comparative advance by thinking of drawbacks sooner since large, important events will have hours of thought put into them anyways.

    I imagine the symptoms of storing zinc would just be something like [sluggish cognitive tempo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sluggish_cognitive_tempo), which is already a real thing...and which can be treated by ADHD stimulants to good effects. On Earth you'd have to find someone to sell you some Ritalin, but you could negate the worst of the drawbacks while storing mental speed for later.

      I think that the point is that during high stress real time activities, like any conversation, you're going to be as convincing as you would be if you had as much time as you wanted to pause and think things through. That's a pretty big advantage for the average person, simply due to the confidence boost of not feeling rushed to come up with something, let alone the benefits available to someone who's prepared. A lot of social interaction can be improved with a couple principles, the trouble is integrating that stuff so you don't have to remember a list in the middle of the conversation. Which, again, this helps with.

      I'm not saying that this would necessarily make you superhuman, but it would let you *always* put your best foot forward.

  Information hazard. 

  you have an envelope. inside the envelope, is an information hazard. anyone who sees this information will be affected by it, and rendered comatose. excluding destruction of the information, what is the best course of action? 

  for reference, we can say that this is a picture of medusa's head. not a mirror-reflection, but an accurate representation of what her head looks like. pictures of this picture retain the same effect, as does video feed of the picture, however a loss of picture quality may reduce or even prevent the effect.
  ```

  - u/MrCogmor:
    ```
    It would be useful for covert email assassination. 

    Setup a trap website. When a trap website is first visited it displays the infohazard in such a way that it is constructed by javascript and not stored in cache. After a short period of time (but long enough for the image to take effect) the infohazard is removed and the webpage transforms into a perfectly innocuous page removing all evidence of the infohazard. Subsequent visitors do not get the infohazard and just get the innocuous content. 

    &#x200B;

    To perform an assassination you would just have to setup a trap website and send an email to someone crafted so that they will click on a link to your trap. Investigators are unlikely to expect that your seemingly innocuous website had anything to do with the coma unless you make an obvious pattern.

      possible problem:

      1) This relies on the email being opened

      2) If it ends up in their spam folder, this definitely won't happen.
      ```

  - u/Frommerman:
    ```
    As a weapon, this is both less effective and more dangerous to the user than a gun, so becoming an assassin is right out. I suppose you could carefully make a copy, then leave it in a room that is soon to host, like, a violent Islamist convention or something, but that would just create a ton of martyrs and would be no more effective than planting a bomb. Plus, that would put the image squarely in the hands of various unspecifiable malevolent actors.

    I think just burying the envelope in a randomly selected area is your best move.

    Have you read [BLIT](http://www.infinityplus.co.uk/stories/blit.htm) and [Different Kinds of Darkness](http://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/different-kinds-of-darkness/)? Basically, the only realistic use of this kind of infohazard is terrorism.
