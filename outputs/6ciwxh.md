  I like where this is going!

  It also, honestly, really makes me want a Worm/Matrix-eqsue crossover.

  What *weird* kind of powers would manifest in a primarily uploaded society? How would physical powers effect the digital world?

  I did not expect to see a SB link here tbh. After that long riffing thread for MoR the site generally isn't very fond of explicit rational!fics.

    Fics from Spacebattles come up here pretty often actually, but the vast majority of them are not intended to be rational or rationalist and only cater to the general munchkinry and nerd culture of SB itself. 

    And the fact that spacebattlers aren't fond of rational culture and fiction is an understatement if I ever saw one. I've seen people bash and make fun of MoR even in threads that aren't related at all to these kinds of things. I remember that there was this average, nonrational fic in which some commenter simply wrote "I like this character because he's rational" which in the general context probably meant the casual definition of "smart". Literally the next post was MoR critique.

      I've seen a lot of people on SB/SV that seem to dislike the genre as a result of some of their own personal biases. 

      One, the foremost example is usually given to be HPMOR, which has its own writing flaws and there is valid criticism to be made against the stylistic design vs it's intent as a work of (fan)fiction. 

      Two, it is seen by many to be an attempt to "STEM-ify" fiction. I think a lot of people who are into literature are naturally adverse to this since many of them have preconceived notions of the efficaciousness of science, mathematics logical reasoning etc. as well as some inherent dislike for these subjects (on average). 

      Three, many people just don't see the appeal. It's like a joke that gets lost in translation to the average audience member instead of playing to the common denominator of that particular audience. I would hazard a guess that many actually don't want to really think too hard about their entertainment if they just want some cool explosions or action scenes (the success of any Michael Bay film would suggest this), neatly regurgitated horror tropes, etc.to pass the time.

      Spacebattler don't like most of rational fiction thanks to sturgeon laws and the tendency of rational authors to defend mary sues by claiming that they are simply rational.

      like quite a lot of rational fiction treats intelligence less like an attribute but more like a super-power that let's you do literally anything after talking about a few vaguely connected to science words
