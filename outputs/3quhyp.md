## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Does any one else think a monthly or biweekly recommendation thread is a good idea to implement? A huge thread where everyone recommends stuff they think is cool.  

  I love almost everything recommended in this sub. As an example, someone mentioned the [Sayer](http://geeklyinc.com/sayer-episode-1-while-you-are-still-paralyzed/) podcast a few weeks ago and I can't stop listening to it. But there's so few recommendations on this sub and I guess I'm one of the few who doesn't really enjoy the BST threads.

    I think recommendations pretty much come along in both of these threads. There are also links to related fiction in the BST threads. I link whatever fiction I'm reminded of, usually.

      Sure they do. I found out about Sayer in a Friday Off topic thread. But then when you look at the [Comic recommendation](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3q52bz/comic_recommendation_thread/) thread put up recently there was so much stuff I'd never even heard of, and more scarily never would have heard of, if not for said thread.

  I'm hoping that someone with better Harry Potter knowledge can help me: what are some examples of historical racism by wizards?

  I've been sort of idly writing a Hermione/Draco fic that's mostly about race relations. My problem is that the discussion of racism in the actual Harry Potter series is a little bit shallow; it's aping the real world but not including any of the complexity that causes all that surface stuff. As one example, here's how the Harry Potter series would do it:

  > "Mudbloods are stupid."    
  > "No they're not, muggleborn have every bit as much magical talent. You're just saying that because you're hateful."

  And here's how I would do it:

  > "Mudbloods perform much worse on their OWLs and NEWTs than purebloods and are therefore stupid."    
  > "Of course they underperform. Muggleborn are at a distinct academic disadvantage. The age restrictions are poorly enforced, which means that by the time a pureblood gets to Hogwarts they've already had a wide exposure to magic as its practiced, even if their parents haven't set out to teach them anything. Muggleborn enter Hogwarts having learned that magic exists only a month or so prior. Additionally, when muggleborn go home for the summer, they have no access to magic and no one to help them study or practice, which means that they experience more of an atrophy effect. It would be weird if their scores *weren't* lower on average. However, once you correct for the home environment and wealth, ..."

  And so on.

  In the real world, there's a whole lot to unpack; colonialism, slavery, Jim Crow laws, institutionalized racism, etc. I don't think that you get a good picture just by assuming that it's all a matter of what's happening in the moment. But I'm having trouble finding out whether the same is true of the wizarding world. Were there "bad old days" that echoed forward into the present? Does more casual racism exist outside of the Death Eater circles? The Death Eaters are basically the Klu Klux Klan mixed with the Nazis; is there a less fanatical version of that?

    In the books? No. In the fandom and canon-by-fiat Pottermore stuff, sure probably, HPMOR does a good job of making Draco's beliefs feel organic and like something a real person would actually think.

    Rowling's depiction of blood purism is more subtle that she usually gets credit for. There are hateful assholes like Lucius Malfoy, but also dumb bigots like Aunt Muriel who simply won't be seen with "those people." Constantly contrasted in the books are conformist upper-class conservatives or those who wish to be seen as such like the Dursleys, Malfoys, Muriel, the sort of person who reads the Daily Prophet for information and not entertainment, and so on vs fun, open, tolerant, free-spirited people like most of the Weasleys, Tonks, H'mione, etc. The former sort allow themselves to be manipulated by the likes of Malfoy and Voldemort because they are more concerned with their social standing and how others perceive them than truth and common sense.

    I don't think there's any reason why British Wizarding bigotry should have much in common with American Muggle bigotry beyond the bigotry part. At any rate the books won't tell you that history because it would be long and boring. The stereotypes and hateful attitudes already existed, and Rowling's point, aside from Bigotry is Bad, is that people go along with these hateful views out of concern for how others view them. The Dursleys for example are more worried about their neighbors thinking they are weird than holy crap, magic exists, ahhh Voldemort, what luck potions are you for real that's just BS. The sort of people who gleefully read Rita Skeeter so they have someone to whisper knowingly about at the next dinner party. They're the real problem with the world, they and super magically powerful immortal Dark Lords.

      I feel like if you want to make a steel-manned version of bigotry, you need something more than just "Draco only believes this because his father believes it" or "Draco only believes this because it allows him to fit in".

      As a non-American example, it would be easy to say that Hitler just hated Jews because that was the cool thing to be doing. But if you were talking to Hitler (or just reading *Mein Kampf*) that's not what you would get. Some of it is intentional agitation, some of it is rhetoric, but I think that when he talks about the process of becoming an anti-Semite he's being mostly truthful about what he felt -- and it was an *intellectual* conversion rather than a *social* one, however flawed that process was. It was about class war and communism, and the events of the first World War. If you just gut all that stuff out, you're getting further from actually understanding the bigotry (and from writing a convincing Hitler).

      (I would expect British Wizarding bigotry to have quite a bit in common with real-world bigotry, if only for Doyalist reasons.)

  Rarely, I feel like arguing about optimal solutions to issues is almost irrelevant.

  > "People don't change their minds. They die, and are replaced by people with different opinions."  -  Arturo Albergati

  Assuming this is true, we have a problem. How can you change someone's mind? Public opinion can be as changeable as the wind, and democracies aren't much better. A crisis can continue for months or years until a journalist captures **that** image, which goes right through the excuse-making brain and into the heart of everyone who sees it. Logic isn't enough -- for humans, feels > reals.

  I feel [this TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXHil1TPxvA) is an improvement, but I don't know if it will catch on. I hope it will.

    I sort of feel the same about this that I do about weight loss.

    Weight loss is about calories in and calories out. But maybe more than that, it's about the mental aspects. The solution to losing weight is *much more* about managing the mental aspects than it is about strictly calories. So to lose weight, you need to say, "Okay, what's the path of least *mental* resistance to reducing net calories?"

    Similarly for policy debate, there's a very necessary component to "optimal" which is "what will people actually go for". If your idea of optimal doesn't include the question of how the typical brain is going to react, then I would argue that's a bad definition of optimal (and I also think that this is one of the main failure modes for people who call themselves rational).

    Depends on how insane you want to be. I've used zip-ties and velcro ties with success. If you want to be absolutely certain you're Doing It Right and you want your ties to last forever but also be relatively easy to fix if you mess up, well, [pretend to be NASA](https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/codeq/doctree/87394.pdf).

        Whoops, sorry. :P

        Honestly, having worked on humanoid robots before, some of that advice is actually pretty straightforward and usable. Like the bit about how to properly apply heat-shrink to a cable.
        ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    A good case will have cable guiding holes that let you put most of the cabling tightly together at the edge of the case. This minimises the need for twist ties.

    Though I personally don't really care much for cable management, in fact all my sata ones are loose so I can easily swap components ;p

    Otherwise, it's not that hard. Make sure the pins on the cpu are straight, you have to use some force to seat it - more than you would think but don't try to hammer it in, it should go in with just constant pressure. Don't forget thermal paste. Everything eles is hard to fuck up.

      It's gotten less important since storage quit using flat ribbon cables, but those motherboard and PCI power cables are still a problem.
      ```

  - u/ArgentStonecutter:
    ```
    I wouldn't use twist-ties. Velcro or zip-ties. Velcro has the advantage of being easy to adjust. Zip-ties are more compact and neater, but once they're in you have to cut them off.

    One compromise might be beaded cable ties, like [this](http://www.delcity.net/images/photos/19015205_Primary.jpg).

  How do I best word a [Divination](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/divination) to find someone who may or may not be dead? I know the guy's name and I suspect he is behind the construction of a secret mutant army and a simulacrum of the current king.

    "Which direction should I head at a constant rate of <distance> per second to encounter, in exactly <timeframe>, the person whom I suspect to be behind the construction of a secret mutant army and a simulacrum of the current king and is named <name>."
    ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I'm a fan of setup/question structure, myself. It allows for cleaner grammar and therefore easier reasoning. Maybe something like this:

    There is a person named Bob who has [descriptive traits]. I suspect he is behind the construction of a secret mutant army and a simulacrum of the current king.  There is a location X which has GPS coordinates. If Bob is dead, then X has the coordinates -1,-1. If Bob is alive, then X has the coordinates that I can reach in the minimum time that would, in the moment I reached them, put me within 2 meters of Bob. My divination question is: what are the coordinates of X?"

    EDIT:  typos.

  Just started cognitive behaviour therapy. It's far simpler and more direct than I expected, but looking back it makes a lot of sense to have it be so seeing as anything long or complicated will be more likely to be ignored by people with depression.

  Also, can anyone think of a good way to describe what rationalism is to normal people in a couple of sentences?

  Do you prefer the shape of Australia or of Britain (the islands, not the countries)?

  ---

  I think I prefer Australia's shape, myself. The rectangular outlines of its western coast, the Gulf of Carpentaria, and the "Top End" (in addition to the amazingly-triangular Cape York Peninsula) look particularly nice to me, while its other coasts are pleasingly smooth in their curves (with the rather glaring exceptions of Spencer Gulf and Gulf St. Vincent in the south...).

  On the other hand, Britain looks far more irregular and haphazard. Elongated southwestern England and vaguely-rectangular Wales and northernmost Scotland are fairly interesting to look at, as is rounded East Anglia--but the zig-zag in southern Scotland, and the fragmented nature of Scotland's western coast ("[Kingdom of the Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_the_Isles)" indeed!), definitely put me off.

  (Playing [grand-strategy games](http://www.reddit.com/r/paradoxplaza) for [hundreds](http://imgur.com/a/abX8X) of [hours](http://imgur.com/a/sOdoW) really forces you to look at the shapes of places...)

  - u/Transfuturist:

    I suspect you're entering these answers into your spreadsheet like with your other friends.

    I prefer the UK. The coasts are more irregular, and it's smaller, too, which emphasizes the coasts. It has such a lovely British shape. If I were going on maximum perimeter, I would pick Norway, but the UK is more irregular on a macro scale.
