## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  After a serious storm, I'm on my second day without power. There was apparently some serious infrastructure damage which means that power won't be back on in my neighborhood until tomorrow at the earliest.

  I tend to do a lot of thinking about the mostly invisible physical systems that make up modern society like running water, electricity, internet, credit cards, and the complex supply chains that allow me to pick from a wide variety of products at any store. I think there are some people who look at things like that and get frightened by it, because it can seem so fragile; if the power goes out in your house, you lose both refrigeration, which doesn't just set you back to pre-refrigeration technology but *further* because you can't cook without your electric stove or your microwave. And you can't go to the store, because the stores are either closed (due to loss of power) or not taking credit cards (due to loss of power). Things weren't quite that bad for me, because I have a propane grill, a stock of non-perishable staples, and emergency cash, but in the abstract it's sobering.

  Then I start thinking about what life is like in places where there are routine rolling blackouts or a lack of services to begin with. There was a documentary I watched a while back about what life was like in Soviet Russia, which I think is more intruiging than the third world, because it's not that they didn't have the technology, it was instead a system failure.

    I once went through a short phase where I saw society as insanely fragile and was utterly terrified by what would happen when the house of cards inevitably comes crashing down. However, I then realized that humans have been constructing civilizations for thousands of years and collapses like the one I was imagining are rare historically. So what was keeping such a complex system going?

    The answer is a combination of three major factors with a lot of other minors ones which I'm not going to go into:

    * It's difficult for any single person to do meaningful damage to society as a whole. Therefore, no lone madman can destroy a nation a la Joker-style.

    * Virtually every aspect of civilization requires infrastructure to function. This means that it's in everyone's long term best interest to cooperate (or at least follow laws) to maintain an advanced lifestyle.

    * It's *self-reinforcing*. Societies undergo a particular form of mimetic evolution where the weaker societies either collapse or get taken over by others. As a result, the better surviving societies pass on their systems of governance and cultural mores. More advanced civilizations are built from the bones and foundations of earlier civilizations. I could spend a good hour talking about how the Renaissance contributed to the make-up of all cultures descended from Europe of the 1300-1500s.

    I know that you weren't asking how civilization can function, but I wanted to share a few points I found fascinating and comforting to know.

    There are people who take up prepping as a hobby, but NatGeo all showed them as people with insane model of reality.

    I think prepping is interesting and educational too, and it would be nice if our civilization have some built-in resilience as well.

      Yeah, a lot of people just go nuts and get into this loop of doing things that are more about power fantasy than actually preparing for the end of the world (in other words, prepping isn't about prepping). There are many times that preppers just start stockpiling guns, which ... isn't really going to help you that much, since after a certain point guns are just cool toys.

      Knowledge, physical health, and self-sufficiency are what you should really start working on, but there are tons of preppers who are overweight and focused entirely on the warfare aspect. They're like "runners" who kit themselves out with the best running shoes, running shorts, water bottle, etc., talk all the time about running, but then don't actually *go running*. This is a common failure mode for lots and lots of things people do (writing is the one I see the most often, but that's because I put myself around a lot of people who are supposedly writers).

  **On modding**:
  I shipped a mod for factorio: [MagneticFloor](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/hackerkiba/MagneticFloor)

  I feel good for fixing the bugs and making it usable to the public at large. On the other hand...there's a lack of a tutorial on how to use it. I am rectifying that slowly, however.

  It's mod that's initially about floors that provide better movement bonus, but the real gem of the mod is the ability to automate movement of the player from one place to another though you'll need a factory setup to produce more of copper floors and directives that control movements, exemplifying the factorio spirit of automation and logistics.

  **On writing**: The end is near for a terrible fanfic I am writing, but I slowed down considerably. I got this weird feeling against working directly on writing new chapters and finishing it versus working on filler tasks, which I am happy to do but I know won't progress to the final chapter. 

  Despite the badness of the fic, I feel good about writing what I want to write and see in a fic.

  I am working on an original fic project that I kept mentioning on worldbuilding threads for the past few weeks, but I am nt prepared to fire on all cylinder to the project. I am still worldbuilding and there should be considerable amount of research. Naming places as always, difficult, and so is inventing new nations and a historical timeline. 

  **On productivity**:

  I am using timeboxing to great effect, setting my effort at twenty minutes each. In my experience, it's short enough to not feel too long yet long enough to make substantial progress. Sometime, however, you only get very little done, but that may be due to reasons other than not being able to focus on a task. Usually that means I am learning something or googling or researching something. 

  Is there any research on productivity of timeboxing? (I am supposed to be using the podomoro technique, but I can't be bother to take a specified five minutes break)

      Political beliefs are a proxy for other things too, and that's probably what's going on with dating. From a Scott Alexander article [(link)](http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/06/guns-and-states/):
      >The Red Tribe is most classically typified by conservative political beliefs, strong evangelical religious beliefs, creationism, opposing gay marriage, owning guns, eating steak, drinking Coca-Cola, driving SUVs, watching lots of TV, enjoying American football, getting conspicuously upset about terrorists and commies, marrying early, divorcing early, shouting “USA IS NUMBER ONE!!!”, and listening to country music.

      > The Blue Tribe is most classically typified by liberal political beliefs, vague agnosticism, supporting gay rights, thinking guns are barbaric, eating arugula, drinking fancy bottled water, driving Priuses, reading lots of books, being highly educated, mocking American football, feeling vaguely like they should like soccer but never really being able to get into it, getting conspicuously upset about sexists and bigots, marrying later, constantly pointing out how much more civilized European countries are than America, and listening to “everything except country”.

      He's painting with a wide brush here, but you can see how a lot of these things, which *sound* strongly correlated with politics, might affect a choice of who you want to build a life with. I personally don't care a huge amount about, say, whether someone thinks marginal taxes should be slightly higher or lower, or whether the TPP is good or not. But if I'm going to make a life with someone, a lot of these other listed things *do* matter. Even if there's not an actual correlation, there's a *perception* of a correlation, which is enough for most people. Were I a Red, I wouldn't dismiss someone for, hypothetically, voting democrat; I would dismiss them for being someone who likes soccer or eats arugula or that whole package, etc.

      I'd really say so. From your description, you seem to be unusually open-minded. Or maybe you don't feel that strongly about politics?
      ```

      - u/whywhisperwhy:
        ```
        > I'd really say so.

        How do you see this affecting things, specifically? For example, at gatherings/parties do you see people refuse to associate with each other due to political differences? Because again, in most situations I see the opposite- debates ensue (which can turn into arguments if the people involved aren't careful), but in general these are handled in an adult fashion and other factors such as how vitriolic, uncompromising, or loose with facts they are plays a bigger role in determining how the two sides feel about each other.

        > Or maybe you don't feel that strongly about politics?

        I care about politics a lot, but I'm also of the opinion that given how complicated the system is and given the vastly different backgrounds of most other interested people, it's a mistake to judge people too harshly based on their specific beliefs. For example, I have friends who are very opposed to transexual rights, which I disagree with, but as long as they are able to give solid reasons why they feel that way, it doesn't shift my opinion of their character much. Ultimately, being able to accept new evidence and correct your beliefs seems like a more important character trait.

  Yesterday I watched My Neighbor Totoro for the first time and it put me in a good mood for the first time in a while. I like Kiki's Delivery Service more, but Totoro is just so simple and sweet that it couldn't help but brighten my day. [A month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/4o7qu0/d_wednesday_worldbuilding_thread/d4aawjt) I shared an idea I had for a story that /u/scruiser is now writing, and since the Happy Stories contest is in need of more entries I thought I'd share another premise that Totoro inspired in me.

  I started with the idea of telling the same story in an urban setting, where the protagonists encounter weirdness due to social isolation instead of geographic isolation. Then I thought about making the Totoro analogue an alien who's "roughing it" on Earth. It sees humans as wildlife that can't be clearly communicated with and our society as an ecosystem that shouldn't be disturbed, maybe Earth is like a Yellowstone National Park for them.

  The best idea for why the aliens haven't been discovered is that their camping gear includes human disguises and cloaking devices. The protagonists probably decide to follow "that weird hobo everyone else ignores", but they're lonely and curious enough to follow them back to their campsite and see what they really are. The alien doesn't mind, it thinks these humans are cute, and Friendship Ensues!

  Well, that's pretty much it. Totoro is very simple movie that doesn't even really tell a story, it's just about two sisters going through mundane events in their lives and occasionally running into a friendly forest spirit who looks like a giant chipmunk. If that can warm my heart, why not tell a story about some socially ostracized kids that hang out with a weird alien? Am I the only one who fantasized about that when I was a kid?

  (Paraphrased from a reddit comment I didn't think to save.)

  The reason Avatar (the movie) ended in tragedy was that the Na'vi were made too perfect. 

  Humans are willing to spend a *stupendous* amount of money and effort to find a peaceful solution. They've been at it for years. The Avatar Program alone likely dwarfs the costs of the entire military base. We don't treat *humans* nearly this well IRL, when they're third-world and live on top of a valuable resource. 

  And the Na'vi, while not fully rational economic partners, are open to trade.

  But because they were made so perfect, there is nothing they want from Earth. No-one is hungry, or sick, or doing unpleasant labour, or interested in material comforts, or in conflict with another tribe. Despite being like 7 tech levels ahead, Earth has nothing to offer them.

  And so trade is at an impasse, and Earth eventually resorts to violence.
  ```

  - u/UltraRedSpectrum:
    ```
    The ending of Avatar was completely idiotic. The entire movie was an ill-conceived metaphor for colonialism, complete with "noble savages" and magical space-Native Americans. That'd be aggravating enough, since it perpetuates the same stupid whitewashing of every culture the Europeans ever wiped out that's so pervasive in our literature; replacing diverse and complex societies with a vague bland hippy-ish free loving *thing* that favours fairy stories that appeal to our modern Western sensibilities over anything resembling a real pre-industrial civilization.

    But then the natives *won*. That doesn't just ruin the parallel, it sets it on fire, runs over it with a train, and throws the crushed remains in a garbage disposal. In the moment that happened, it went from shitty, hamhanded metaphor to bad Mary-Sueish historical fix-fic. The humans utterly fail to exercise even the most basic level of strategy, entering hand-to-hand combat when they clearly have air superiority and enough firepower to burn down the entire planet, just so we can watch glorified rhinos somehow destroy tanks with their space magic and hunter-gatherers defeat space marines with sticks and stones.

        I mean, they live in the garden of Eden. "Science/civilization ruins everything" might be an unpopular trope 'round these parts, but when your life is damn near perfect, regression to the mean is a serious concern.

        What criticism there is to be made, is to be laid at the feet of the scriptwriter who built the world. In-universe, the pic's attempt to redefine victory as "building the pyramids" or spreading ourselves across the galaxy ([we total utilitarians now?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism)) rather than having your entire species live pleasant, satisfying lives sounds very sour-grapes.

        (Humans do have a much higher upper bound for longevity. Though an informed Na'vi would argue back that the Na'vi's odds of surviving the next few centuries are much higher - or would have been had they not have the cosmically unlikely misfortune of crossing our path.)

  If your (your character’s) goal was to improve lives for as many people as possible using all the money you managed to save from your monthly income, what path of actions would you choose as the most efficient one? Please assume that you start with monthly income equal to ×1.5 the minimal wage for your country (if you’re ok with it, specify how much it is in your comment for context) and with average intellectual capabilities.

  Same question, but also assume that you can not donate to charities or start them yourself, donate or collect money in general.

  - u/Faust91x:
    ```
    Probably the first step would be to analyze the community and find what issues plague it the most to focus effort on them.

    That's too little money in my country (we're talking about a third world one) so I'd probably investigate and teach myself some production technique to then teach others. That way they don't become dependent on the influx of resources I provide.

    Another option is to start saving and preparing for a start up so that I can provide income to others, teach them something they can do with their time (which will help lower crime too) and ensure I increase my income and can thus use the resulting money to fund other enterprises/donate to charity.

    I think the rational goal of such a character would be to win on the long term, spending it all on charity and helping people is good but won't have such a lasting impact on his community if he does so alone. Plus, more than money, time is a more valuable asset and he can do more stuff if he no longer has to worry about running out of money.

  When I saw that [GOG had gotten *SimCity 3000*](https://www.gog.com/game/simcity_3000) (which I used to play quite a lot, around a decade ago), it occurred to me that a city-building game (whether Maxis-style or [Impressions-style](https://www.gog.com/game/pharaoh_cleopatra)) with *[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves)*'s interface would be absolutely *awesome* to play. I mean, really--other than the management of dwarves' allowed labors (for which the external utility [Dwarf Therapist](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=122968) is more or less *necessary*), I find *Dwarf Fortress*'s interface to be absolutely *exquisite*.

Also, YouTube's compression has added some rather serious artifacting to parts of the video.)

  It's pretty weird, I must say, to see mobile suits animated at this *Scooby Doo, Where Are You?* level of quality after watching *Build Fighters*, *SEED*, and even *G*. Also, the non-standardized transliterations (`Dozul` for `Dozle`, `Jabrow` for `Jaburo`, etc.) are rather funny.

  I have been finding it surprisingly good, it started with the pattern of a know-it-all womanizing MC, but the quality of the production have been surprising, and the female MC has shown some promise.

  It has a lot of fun to be had already and the devs have a history of improving on a core game and expanding the mechanics for years after initial release.

  Does anyone else wonder if having such easily accessible information via the Internet is lowering our overall capacity to try and solve things ourselves or come up with our own conclusions?

  Specifically I'm thinking about search engines. Any answer is just a Google search away. If you don't want to, you have no need to come to try and think on your own; to form deductions and conclusions based on limited knowledge is something that takes effort and leaves you better off, I feel. 

  Sorry for this obscenely vaguely worded question. I'm both unsure of what I want to say and on mobile.
  ```

  - u/ZeroNihilist:
    ```
    In my experience, search engines (and knowledge databases in general) allow you to formulate more complex questions, though obviously that's not the only way they're used.

    Back when you needed to go to a library and check out a book you hoped was relevant (and read that book to find the pertinent page), it took an enormous amount of time to find any information outside your field of expertise. Sometimes you simply couldn't, if you didn't have access to the right library.

    That meant that you couldn't easily synthesise the various data points needed for more substantial issues unless somebody else had already done the legwork, or you were getting paid for it.

    Now it's changed. I can find the answer to almost any question very quickly (including whether or not that answer is contested). That could mean that I simply stop there, satisfied with my answer, or I could use that information as a basis for future inquiries.

    Essentially, by removing the difficulty of actually finding the information search engines enable you to pull from hundreds of sources in a way that would have taken weeks or months before. The difficulty of your deductions is now limited by voluntary complexity, rather than by an absence of information.

    I developed my skill in programming enough that I almost never ask for 'help' in debugging something. I used google to mainly look up API references, and sometime to google the context of errors.

    Additionally, the last time I helped a programming noob, I immediately noticed several errors that needed correcting that has nothing to do what he was asking.

    Writing is a creative process that almost never happen with google search unless I am trying to research something. 

    When I am learning something new, googling definitely spike.

  I just finished a rewatch of Naruto Shippuden from about the half-way point, starting with Jiraiya v. Pain, ending with the most recent episode, and I gotta say, it is *much* better watched all at once, with filler removed.


  [
  Naruto Kai] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/48p81o/naruto_kai_all_episodes_megathread_2/) is basically a bunch of 90-120 minute arcs, with the filler and opening and ending sequences removed. It is amazing. Has completely changed my viewing experience of Naruto Shippuden.

  It has given me a new appreciation for Kishimoto as well. The problems I had with Naruto are still there but watching everything at once makes a lot (not all, though) of apparent plot holes disappear, makes the epic symbolism and incredibly thought out foreshadowing more impressive, and really hammers in the philosophy of Naruto.

  I now realize that the oft-maligned feature of Naruto, the pervasive flashbacks, are a really important part of Naruto's philosophy.

  (incoming rant on Naruto ahead)   (Also I don't know how to do giant spoiler tags so I spoiler tagged each individual paragraph...)

  [](#s " The way of power says that only with enough power to make all fear you and unite against you or under you, can you stop violence. This is how Kaguya, Indra, Madara, Nagato (until he repents), Obito (until he repents), and Sasuke (until he changes his mind) etc. act and believe. ")

  [](#s " Naruto believes in trust. He acknowledges the suffering caused by war, but thinks that the common recognition of such suffering can lead to a mutual understanding of hatred, and the reconciliation of everyone with each other, and eventually peace.")

  [](#s " Kishi hammers those in by using flashbacks to show the central pain of each character's life, and how it has affected them. Naruto often thinks about his central pain of loneliness, Sasuke thinks of his clan's slaughter, Obito of the loss of Rin, etc.")

  [](#s " And Kishi shows just how interconnected cycles of violence are. One conflict leads to another leads to another, etc. ")

  [](#s " The key moments of redemption for characters like Gaara, Nagato, Obito, Kabuto, Orochimaru, etc. all come from choosing trust over power as a means to peace, optimism and faith in humanity over pessimism. ")

  [](#s " I'm not sure that I agree with Naruto's message in practice (I think that in real life, the threat of punishment and a powerful group or state actually very effectively reduces violence), but it is a powerful message for a show.")



  Anyways, I recommend y'all check out Naruto Kai, it's a great way to view the series.
