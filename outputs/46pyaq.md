  > Why do the rules of engagement for a duel require it to happen at high noon?

  Back to the Future 3 gave an explanation for that one... Paraphrasing from memory:  
  - Wait! The Sun is in my eyes!  
  - It's high noon! The Sun is equally in our eyes!   
  - Oh, so that's why they always did it at high noon...
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I actually laughed out loud, but you could duel from north to south and have the duel at any point.
    ```

    - u/GaBeRockKing:
      ```
      But then that gives one side an advantage because their outstretched arm will block the sun's rays, while the other person's arm won't.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        One of them has to use their left hand.
        ```

        - u/gbear605:
          ```
          But then that person has a disadvantage
          ```

        - u/GaBeRockKing:
          ```
          The hand they wipe their butt with? how dishonorable, what's the point of dueling if you don't do it honorably?
          ```

  I wrote [this](http://mhd-hbd.tumblr.com/post/139258778601/concept-star-wars-but-you-know-not-sucking) a while back. (It's a rambling rant, not a story.)

  [Steven Universe](http://theworldofstevenuniverse.blogspot.dk/p/steven-universe-season-1-english.html) also qualifies. It deconstructs a *metric fuckton* of tropes.
