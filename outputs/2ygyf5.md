  Why do I get the feeling that we are just flat out not going to see or hear from a conscious Hermione before the absolute end? 

  There are so many unanswered questions there - what can normal wizards discern from the dark rituals used on her? Do they know about the Horcrux with Dumbledore gone? 

  Literal *weeks* have gone by in universe, and Harry hasn't spoken to her?

  I can't help but wonder. 

  We never did find out exactly what Voldemort did to Hermione when he revived her. 

  We know that he knows at least in part how to duplicate his mind state and impress it on others.

  We know that he knows how to lose.

  I can't help but be tensed up, waiting for the shoe to drop.

    I was confused about the "weeks ago" reference as well but some other posts pointed out that, quite sensibly, they had already been (i.e., prior to the big reveal) discussing funeral arrangements for QQ because he was so ill.

      That makes a bit of sense, but still, from a narrative standpoint, it's quite suspicious.

        I find it subtle and non-obvious, but not suspicious.

        >. Professor Flitwick had asked him about it weeks ago in May, to give Harry time to write his lines *before it would become necessary to speak*

        I think the emphasized portion clinches it.  It while Quirrell was on his deathbed.

    Whoa, my sense of time is way off or something. I assumed that though they were at different locations, the wak and funeral were happening on the same day. The funeral is announced to be two days after 117, which starts:

    >He had collapsed in exhaustion last night and been awoken in the infirmary next morning, still muzzy, with the Philosopher's Stone underneath his left sock.

    I thought that meant he was waking up the day after all the things happened that lead to him getting the Stone of Permanence. Meaning this is the the third day Hermione has been alive again.
