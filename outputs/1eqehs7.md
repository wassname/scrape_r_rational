## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  A Succession of Bad Days by Graydon Saunders is the second of his Commonweal novels. It has some times been described as a fairytale meets a civil engineering manual. It’s about a group of young wizards learning to be wizards, often through cooperating on large scale civil engineering works like magically building a huge canal vital to stop an oncoming famine. It's set in the Commonweal, an island of egalitarian political stability in a death world ruled by tyrannical wizard kings. 

  I read A Succession of Bad Days (along with The March North) a few years ago, and I enjoyed them. Mostly. For a specific value of enjoy. If you’ve ever read a Graydon Saunders book you’ll know what I’m talking about but, if you haven’t, they read like nothing else I’ve ever read. Alien far past the point of obtuseness. A snapshot of an alternate timeline where the entire English language literature tradition developed differently, as someone once described it. Nothing is explained, especially the explanations. There’s a fascinating world and story there somewhere but damn if  Saunders doesn’t make it difficult to find.

  *Anyway*, I’m looking for recommendations for any other ‘magical civil engineering’ books or web serials. People using their magic in large creative ways to improve or exploit the land. Does anyone know anything with a focus on that?

  There’s going to be some overlap with base building and similar genres. But I’m specifically looking for people using their magic in interesting ways to accomplish civil engineering, not wizard king tells his chief of infrastructure to see to the construction of thirty more pylons.

    [Demesne](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/40290/demesne) is at least half this. It petered out for me after a while, mostly because I’d caught up and the update pace was a bit slow for the story, but I see there’s a lot now, I might start again :)
    ```

    - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
      ```
      Of note, Demesne is *only* this, you get full chapters of only magitech engineering, with roughly 0% character development over hundreds of chapters.  Think Delve, just instead of souldiving its magic shape descriptions.
      ```

      - u/sl236:
        ```
        …yeah, this is why I ultimately bounced off tbh - I do like /some/ character development, and you really need to consume Demesne in much larger chunks than one chapter at a time for that.
        ```

        - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
          ```
          Yeah, fully agree.
          ```

    - u/grekhaus:
      ```
      Demesne also has the issue that the viewpoint character is "Loli Yuri" and goes on to take a child hostage. It backs away from the obvious implications of that very quickly, but the author thinks he is very clever for dropping the hints. His other works are less subtle. If you can separate the work from the author, it's a decent read, but I ultimately had to drop it on those grounds.

    Greatest Estate Developer is a manhwa and a web novel about a civil engineer isekaied into a fantasy world and he uses magic to make all kinds of buildings, bridge, big public housing, a racing course and others. Uplift focused. Mostly comedic but has some good serious moments as well. Despite the cliche premise I very much recommend it if you enjoy the comedy.
    ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    My favorite bit of engineering fiction is **"The man who bridged the mist" by Kij Johnson**, Hugo/Nebula winning novella, about a civil servant who uses the ordinary magic of logistics to build a rather large suspension bridge over a corrosive fluffy cloud river. Used to be online for free but got removed a while back. 




    For a less strict interpretation, theres some glowfic which qualifies; a large canon of Deava fics, with the power of arbitrary matter generation, lends itself to this type, altough the power set is hilariously overpowered. **This is pretty cute: https://glowfic.com/posts/2310**   unfinished but at a good stopping point, rest left as exercise for the reader. 


    We also have major glowfic protag **Leareth, who is a firm believer in public works at any cost,** and then other people violently objecting to this. Though not too much of a focus on the engineering usually, so a bit tangential perhaps.  Theres a great animorphs crossover if thats something you are interested in, or a Leareth/Daevinity crossover if the read the above link, but hes so popular and awesome you can get dozens of flavors of him if you want. 

    **The greatest public works of them all would of course be aligned AGI**, and we also do have a couple fics that go about that: ~2100 AGI-future protag gets dropped into Avatar:last airbender, or into Leareths' world or or. And from other parties we have tries at magi-AGI. 

    Any of that sounds interesting?

      I'll second this rec. It's a really good short story.

  I'd like to recommend The Will of the Many - academy setting, cool unique magic system, super smart/competent yet flawed character with detailed internal monologue.


  I'm only 60% of the way through but I feel that it's an obvious recommendation for this sub, and I'm reading it because of multiple strong recommendations from people I know (who have finished it and are aware of what kind of books I like, i.e stuff this subreddit likes). 




  Blurb:
  I tell them my name is Vis Telimus. I tell them I was orphaned after a tragic accident three years ago, and that good fortune alone has led to my acceptance into their most prestigious school. I tell them that once I graduate, I will gladly join the rest of civilised society in allowing my strength, my drive and my focus – what they call Will – to be leeched away and added to the power of those above me, as millions already do. As all must eventually do.

  I tell them that I belong, and they believe me.

  But the truth is that I have been sent to the Academy to find answers. To solve a murder. To search for an ancient weapon. To uncover secrets that may tear the Republic apart.

  And that I will never, ever cede my Will to the empire that executed my family.

    Seconding this rec. Read it in one sitting - better than James Islington’s other books, in my opinion. Easy and enjoyable read.
    ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    I am also about 60% of the way through.

    The worldbuilding is fairly novel and interesting - that's where the originality of the story stops though.

    Every character, every plot beat - the shape of them, the flow of the dialogue, the sequence of reveals, the "hidden" layers of the cast, the love interest, the progression... it was all so rote. I feel like i knew the outline of every chapter halfway through it's first page.
    (I'm exaggerating perhaps a little, but not much)

    The execution was good - i think someone who'd never read a story like this before would fall in love with it - but it felt so archetypical. 

    Some other annoyances: the hand of the author was clear a number of times where characters acted as the plot demanded not as they should, and the characters competency has always been "told" so far, never shown. He's great at fantasy chess, he's great at puzzles, oh he knows a lot of languages! You know the drill.

    Despite all that I'm still reading the story and I am someone who drops stories all the time when they're not good enough. The execution is enough here for me to keep going.

    I finished reading this yesterday. 6/10 for me, and it definitely isn't rational or rationalist.

    The novel is very similar to Red Rising in prose and plot (YA MC that hates the system goes to elite school competition) but is inferior in both.

    The world building is weak and poorly thought out (>!The finishing school for society's ultra-elite only lasts for 1 year? 5 ranked classes that MC must move up, starting from the bottom, where the ultra elite are apparently lazy dullards (even though class rank largely determines your future) that are studying remedial material that MC learned when he was a tween. There's only 1 teacher for each class, the teacher has ultimate decision making power, and it's fine for them to display Snape-levels of unfairness because well, life is unfair so students have to work around it.!<) and some plot points are too ridiculous to believe (>!MC saves a feral (magic) wolf pup, has no other contact with it, and then it comes back to fight alongside the MC during the climax!<). 

    Despite my criticisms, the book was reasonably enjoyable as a popcorn read. If you enjoyed Red Rising, you'll probably like this. But there's nothing rational about The Will of the Many.

  I like the format of webnovels compared to traditional story structure, but RR is just dominated by litrpg crap. I've probably looked through the first ~50 pages of top rated, any recommendations that are great despite low ratings?

  Latest stories I've enjoyed are Necroepilogos and the Goblins comic, favorites off the top of my head include Pale Lights, Super Supportive, Lord of the Mysteries, Cultivation Chat Group, and Godclads.

  Side question: which Rad Codex game would you recommend to a first timer?

    You can try RoyalRoad's advanced search. For example, [here is a search](https://www.royalroad.com/fictions/search?tagsRemove=litrpg&minPages=843&minRating=4.2&orderBy=followers) of non litrpg stories with at least 800 pages and at least a 4.2 rating sorted by followers. I personally find this kind of thing much more useful than looking at the Best Rated list.

    Stories with a villainous protagonist or other "edgy" elements often have a disproportionately lower rating. I enjoyed these two relatively edgy stories that don't have a high rating on RoyalRoad.

    [Violent Solutions
    ](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/52324/violent-solutions)

    [Systemic Lands](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/57018/the-systemic-lands-dark-progressive-litrpg)
    ```

    - u/CatInAPot:
      ```
      While rating is no guarantee for personal enjoyment, I have found that my "hit percentage" goes down as I go deeper into the ranks. There are no doubt some incredible works unfairly given lower ratings, but there's also going to be a lot of stuff that just isn't good.

      The problem for me isn't really filtering, I'm pretty flexible about genres (litrpgs just suffer from oversaturation), just don't want to spend hours browsing for largely disappointing reads.

    >any recommendations that are great despite low ratings?

    In my experience, anything below about 4.3 rating in royalroad is basically trash. So I wouldn't even waste time looking at them if I were you.

    If you like chinese webnovels, I can recommend a few of them. Not everyone likes to read translations though.
    ```

    - u/xjustwaitx:
      ```
      Worth the Candle has a 4.49 and is a favorite of many here, and I suspect if HPMOR was on RR it would get below 4.3


      Not contradicting you (since it's an empirical statement I don't have a contradiction for) but I think it's possible that there is a hidden gem
      ```

    - u/CatInAPot:
      ```
      A few years ago, there was a story on RR that I quite enjoyed (Risen) that had a pretty terrible rating, and basically every negative review was about the opening sequence being too confusing. Been wondering how many hidden gems I've missed out on since.

      I'm wouldn't mind chinese webnovel recommendations, though I think I'm familiar with all the common suggestions.
