## [Biweekly Challenge] Mere Reality

### Post:

## Last Time

[Last time,](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g108/biweekly_challenge_first_contact/?sort=confidence) the prompt was "First Contact". /u/kishoto is the winner with their story [Um...hi?](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/47g108/biweekly_challenge_first_contact/d0d2met). Go read it now! Congratulations to /u/kishoto! This makes you the first to five wins, which is not only an accomplishment that puts you at the top of the leaderboard, but earns you special champion's flair. Additionally, you may choose you own prompt for an upcoming challenge if you'd like - just PM me.

##### This Time

This time, the challenge will be "Mere Reality". In other words, fiction that takes place in the real world, or something very close to it. No magic, no fancy super tech, just people in the real world doing realistic things. We're looking for something that's exceptionally grounded. (My personal advice would be to look for real life examples and work from there, but YMMV.)

The winner will be decided **Wednesday, March 23rd.** You have until then to post your reply and start accumulating upvotes. It is strongly suggested that you get your entry in as quickly as possible once this thread goes up; this is part of the reason that prompts are given in advance. Like reading? It's suggested that you come back to the thread after a few days have passed to see what's popped up. The reddit "save" button is handy for this.

##### Rules

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). Also, if you want a quick index of past challenges, I've [posted them on the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge).

##### Next Time

Wait, I'm getting a premonition ... \**gasp*\* it's the biweekly challenge! The vision is fuzzy, but it seems as though the prompt for next time is going to be "Precognition". I'm not sure exactly what that means, but [I did find this TVTropes page](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Seers?from=Main.Precognition) that might help shed some light on the matter.

**Next challenge's thread will go up on 3/23.** Please private message me with any questions or comments, as the beloved meta thread is now archived. The companion thread for recommendations and discussion [is located here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/49qxc4/challenge_companion_mere_reality/).

  (Something that I thought of about two months ago, but only remembered very belatedly.  Though after this challenge ended, wrote and posting anyway for fun.)

      Read it six months ago, and just read it again; I'm shocked at how alike are the similar bits.  Updating upwards how much influence things nigh-forgotten can have on creativity.  Thank you.

    Spoilers: Am I missing something or is this a regular family with regular dogs, one of whom sneaks food left out?

      I don't know what your question is, so here's more information than I think you requested.

      [Answer:](#s " It's a regular family with a regular dog; the kids sneak food to the dog when the dog lays his head on their foot and pouts up at them, but the parents don't.  In the story, the dog is trying to get at some food left on the counter, which he isn't supposed to do.  The daughter sees the clear attempt, yet the food is still untouched, so she praises the dog for not eating the food.  The narrator, being a dog, is unreliable.")

        [ ](#s "'The narrator, being a dog, is unreliable' is one of those truly perfect sentences.")
