## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  The manga [Sousou no Frieren](https://mangadex.org/title/48045/sousou-no-frieren) (lit. "Aftermath of Frieren") is about the elf in the Hero's party.  Her lifespan was much longer than that of anybody else in the hero's party.  Reality ensues.

  This manga is one of very few that contains what I'd call real emotion.  I wish I knew of more like that.

  [Cradle book #8 Wintersteel is out!](https://www.amazon.com/Wintersteel-Cradle-Book-Will-Wight-ebook/dp/B08JMF22F2/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?ie=UTF8&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0)

  For those who don't know, Cradle is a fairly well written eastern inspired fantasy series written by Will Wright. It adheres to the the concepts of progression fantasy where people continuously can get, 'better," and improve their level with more training. Like litrpg stuff but inherently better because it avoids the fate of inevitably turning into excel number crunching porn where characters spend thousands and thousands of words agonizing about point allocation and scaling modifiers. 

  Very very high level Summary:

  MC is a guy who has no chance of cultivating power b/c of a genetic defect. A weird glitch in the universe occurs and he gets both motivation and advice to be more than just a nobody. 

  [Goodreads link for the first book.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30558257-unsouled) 

  Pros for the series:

  * Well written
  * VERY bingable
  * The characters act quite rational in most cases
  * The action scenes are pretty well written (coming from someone who skims them normally)
  * The worldbuilding is really, really cool
  * The plot is scaling just as well as the characters scale


  Cons:

  * The mc is an obvious and blatant hypocrite post book like 4-5ish?
  * The characters occasionally feel a bit tropey
  *  becomes somewhat cliche in later books
  * Tbh the first book felt extremely slow for me

    Read it for fun, not for rational munchkining and genre deconstruction. The author has boiled down xianxia into its most qunitessential qualities, and injects that straight into your brain through your eyeballs. Enjoy the ride.

      From the start of the series we're told over and over again that his motivation for gaining power is to save his family and the others in the valley. That's why he's willing to take insane risks that constantly put his life on the line.

      By the time he reaches the level of Jade though, he's powerful enough to accomplish his goals. He is much, much stronger than any of the other people in the valley and he needs to use force to convince them, he can. If his reason for gaining power is to save his people, he doesn't need to continue to risk his life and gain more power. He is more than strong enough to go back and get everyone to leave the valley to anywhere else. 

      The fact that he sticks around in the Blackflame Empire, continuing to partake in insane training and events to gain more power go against his stated reasons. At some point his motivation warped from saving his people to just gaining power for (to gain power? be the best? be with his friends? idk, it's kinda ambigious) 

      Like a basic cost benefit analysis that a child could run would point out that his chances of becoming a monarch powerful enough to stop the upcoming destruction to his home are infinitely small. That it's much, much, much more likely that he will die at some point in the process. It's smarter and much more logical to go back and save his people with the power he has now. 

      At the very least, he should go back, move his people AND THEN pursue more power for whatever reasons. Instead he's risking his family and everyone entire future for personal selfish reasons. If he died leading up to the tournament, in the tournament, after the tournament, all the people he supposedly cares for would probably die, because there would be nobody there for them.

        His goal is to save his family from the Dreadgods, isn't it? I don't think he knows the School went full on purge against his clan. That happened after he left. Jade isn't near enough to help against the Dreadgods. Nothing short of Monarch is.
        ```

        - u/Prince_Silk:
          ```
          And becoming a Monarch is an insane goal with lottery like odds, becoming one in 15 years is even more insane. He can easily save his family and clan by getting strong enough to convince them to move. 

          It's much more logical to get powerful enough to strongarm the leaders and general clan to convince them to move in the the greater Blackflame Empire or anywhere else than try to become a Monarch and take on dreadgods.
          ```

          - u/reddithanG:
            ```
            Well then that would be the end of the story wouldnt it? This is xianxia inspired novelã€‚ Of course the MC is going to get a strong as he possibly can.

            - u/Flashbunny:

              "The character does something dumb for the sake of the plot" is a valid complaint for them to be making. In fact, I could swear there was a subreddit about avoiding exactly that sort of thing.
              ```

              - u/cthulhusleftnipple:
                ```
                He's not doing something dumb for 'the sake of the plot'. His approach is baked in to the premise for the series. He is literally told by an agent of the heavens that this is the only way he can achieve his goals. His actions are well-justified in both a watsonian and a doyalist framework, and complaints that he shouldn't approach things this way are missing the point entirely. 

                It's like complaining that Frodo in the Lord of the Rings was stupid for taking such insane risks to travel to Mordor. Why didn't he just build a big forge and melt the ring down in Rivendell? If it needs to be hotter, then you just build a hotter forge; it's not like lava's that hot. Obviously, he's just an idiot...

              - u/reddithanG:
                ```
                No one said this novel was rational. Just a particularly welp written progression fantasy.  Besides, in the beginning of the novel, Suriel specifically tells the MC that the only way to save his family and homeland from the Wandering Titan is to become powerful enough fight against it.
                ```

        > By the time he reaches the level of Jade though, he's powerful enough to accomplish his goals. He is much, much stronger than any of the other people in the valley and he needs to use force to convince them, he can.

        His stated goal is to save his home from the dreadgod attack that's supposed to happen in 15 years, though, for which he needs far greater power. I suppose your point is that he can accomplish the saving the people part by just forcing them to relocate, but that also seems implausible at that level of power. An entire valley of people, some of whom are antagonistic towards Lindon, aren't going to just head off into the deadly wilds j ust because he says. And what, is he going to just kill anyone who doesn't listen? I'm not sure how you think he can really accomplish his goals at the power level he achieves by Jade, even if he didn't care about saving the valley itself.
        ```

        - u/Prince_Silk:
          ```
          Ok maybe just him solo at Jade might not be enough, but by the point that he's Jade, he could have convinced EIthan to come along and convince the people in the valley of the impending threat. Eithan is an underlord with a strong powerbase beneath him at the time.

          If Lindon tells Eithan that for him to be all in with him on Eithan's goals for him, he needs his family + clan moved to a safer location/ect, he could have done it. 

          There are a billion other plans he could have pursued, but it's an obviously insane and stupid plan to try to become a monarch and especially to become one in the needed 15 years. At a number of points after book 5ish he's, "powerful," enough to convince other powerful people in exchange for favors/ect to relocate his family ect. 

          Instead he continues to risk his life and any chance of his family/clan/people in the valley's chances to survive by throwing himself into insane do or die situations. 
          _____
          Like in short my point is this. At some point Lindon has gotten to the point where he has enough solo power, general influence, relationships he can leverage and negotiating power to get his family/clan/everyone in the valley to leave. (Join the Blackflame empire, start a seperate clan, become a part of Eithan's clan, ect) Instead of realizing this and pivoting from power gaining to power leveraging, he risks everything he has gained so far in the pursuit of more personal power for the insane^^2 dream of saving the valley as well. If he can't realize that it seems like he's the dumbest person ever and if he does and still pursues the insane^^2 plan, then he's a hypocrite and used his the, "dream," of saving his family/people as a cover for a plain self interest pursuit of power.

          _________
          Another example would be that Lindon's family is in debtors prison and he needs a ton of money to save them. He tries his hand at playing poker to save them. Because of some crazy rounds and amazing luck he's made enough to pay for their release. Instead of taking the money and leaving, he continues to go all in on every hand, risking everything on the chance he can also make enough money to save the family house. 

          If he wanted to just save his family he would take the money and leave. If he really needed that house, then he should leave, pay for his family's release and then try to go again with what money is left over. 

          There is no situation where continuing to go all-in and risking what he has gained is worth it. The fact that he still is playing though makes it seem like his motivations were fake/and or shifted in the time he's been playing poker.
          ```

          - u/IICVX:
            ```
            Unfortunately, that doesn't work. You're missing the fact that the Sacred Valley is marked as a quarantined site in the Akura maps, which is first mentioned in (I think) Underlord. Eithan doesn't have enough pull with the Akura to get around that. 

            Obviously they're not enforcing the quarantine super well, but the migration of an entire clan out of the Valley would definitely be noticed and stopped.

            Lindon was probably planning on asking for something along these lines after the Uncrowned Tournament, given that he did pretty well.
            ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  I started reading The Humble Life of a Skill Trainer recently, and I'm really liking it. It's got one of the rarest things ever in fiction, constructive introspection. The main character develops skills for self-awareness and later more skills for deeper introspection, and the writing actually reflects that as he starts narrating his thoughts more than his actions. And what's more, it's not all depressed navel-gazing! The story feels well thought out so far (around chapter 25), and nothing has been egregiously irrational. The world does feel dark and somewhat medieval, which leads to some cliches in characters. But otherwise it's been really good!
  ```

  - u/CaramilkThief:
    ```
    Alright I'm caught up with the story, and to be honest it has let me down a bit. For someone who thinks so much about himself and the world around him, the main character really has an annoying tendency to make rash decisions. It feels somewhat out of character, even if the author tells people in the comments that these are some of the protagonist's flaws. 

    Also the premise of the book takes a back seat to politics and meeting new people, which leaves new chapters feeling pretty boring. Someone else may find it fun though, so yeah.

  I'm going to again recommend [Kings of Paradise](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/35994830), book 1 of the (completed) [Ash and Sand Trilogy](https://www.goodreads.com/series/233409-ash-and-sand), this time by itself in a parent level post. The final book of the trilogy was released recently and I can now say that this is not just the best self-published trilogy I've ever read, but among the best fantasy I've ever read.

  blurb: 
  >Ruka, called a demon at birth, is a genius. Born malformed and ugly into the snow-covered wasteland of the Ascom, he was spared from death by his mother's love. Now he is an outcast, consumed with hate for those who've wronged him. But to take his vengeance, he must first survive. Across a vast sea in the white-sand island paradise of Sri Kon, Kale is fourth and youngest son of the Sorcerer King. And at sixteen, Kale is a disappointment. As the first prince ever forced to serve with low-born marines, Kale must prove himself and become a man, or else lose all chance of a worthy future, and any hope to win the love of his life. Though they do not know it, both boys are on the cusp of discovery. Their worlds and lives are destined for greatness, or ruin. 

  My one caveat to potential readers is that the book starts out rather brutally, grim and dark and with >!canibalism!<, but it shouldn't scare you away, as the story as a whole is anything but *grimdark*. Ruka's character arc is amazingly well done, and final book's ending is one of the finest I've ever read. My advice is to keep reading until it changes POV from Ruka to Kale at the least. 

  ------------------------

  (read the following only if you need more convincing) 

  My favourite part of this book, which took me a while to figure out and which I think is seldom mentioned by other reviewers, is a mirroring he does with the two main POV characters, where their lives, their attitudes, their character arcs, the people around them, and even their powers are inverted reflections of one another. An example:

  * Kale is handsome prince born to privilege on a tropical paradise. He is a disappointment to his family and disdains his circumstances and his education. Kale does not know what he wants from life, or who he wants to be.
  * Ruka is born disfigured in a harsh frozen tundra with only his genius level intellect and his mother's love, and he has to fight for survival every moment of his life. He takes nothing for granted. Ruka knows exactly what he wants, vengeance, but is constantly trying to a better person for the sake of his beloved mother.

  The mirroring continues even with the powers that they later develop. Ruka's power >!is apparently inborn and involuntary, where he seems to have a private, fully realized world inside his mind, where he can build things and experiment on his physical skills without risk before trying it in the real world. This private world is populated by people he kills or caused the death of, who carry over their skills in life, but who are unable to communicate. Ruka often wonders if this power is real or just a facet of his insanity. He constantly fears that he is a demon sent by an evil god.!< Kale's power >!is taught to him and comes at great effort. He has the ability to affect the physical world directly, to manipulate the power inherent in things, power which is generated by living beings. It elevates his mind and makes him look like a god about to ascend.!<

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    I began this series on your previous recommendation and have since finished the entire trilogy. It was a pretty good series with a lot of feeling and the author doesnâ€™t pull any punches. 

    I really enjoyed Ruka as a character and the character interactions in general were quality. The opening act of Book 2 was my personal highlight of the series and managed the rare feat of enriching much of the work that came before.

    I think the plot structure was a little ambitious, particularly sans a professional editor, as some of the timeline jumps were very abrupt and some plot developments just burst into the story out of nowhere throwing off the rhythm of the narrative. There were a few too many chapters without enough purpose or significance that would have benefited from removal. Pretty much all things a professional editor would have picked up on. 

    Book 2â€™s climax felt like more of a proper climax than Book 3â€™s too, even if it felt rushed. It held more weight for me than the conflict with the empire. Also, unnecessary and self-indulgent epilogue imo.

    All that aside I would (and have) happily recommended the series.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      I agree with a lot of your points, particularly with the perhaps overly-ambitious scope of the story. I think it's pretty clear that >!Kale's final arc was probably severely cut down in the final book, for example, and he became very one dimensional "because the plot required it".!<

      I do disagree with your point regarding the epilogue, though. To me it hit the spot, I can't see a better way to tie up Ruka's sad story. 

      Also, I consider book 3's climax to be >!not the end of the siege with the empire, but the final confrontation with Ando, which gave the trilogy the overarching theme that it was missing. The idea that human ugliness, brutality curiosity, and search for redemption triumphs over divinity and superstition. The saying "perfect is the enemy of good" comes to mind, together with the thought that while humans can be good at times, and should strive for it, perfect will forever be out of reach. !< Or that's my thought on it, I'm still thinking on the it.

  - u/123whyme:
    ```
    My god, I couldn't agree more. I've read most of the most well known fantasy series out there and kings of paradise tops all of them. It genuinely amazes me it hasn't taken off yet, one of the only books I've ever reread.

    - u/TridentTine:

    ```
    Gave it a look.  This is the first line of the first page of the first book:  "Ruka stared at the corpse of the boy he's killed, and his stomach growled."

    If the author goes casual cannibalism, I generally do not like the story.
    ```

    - u/GlueBoy:
      ```
      That's a valid take, I think that's a bad way to start a story, particualy this story which is not ultimately brutal or grimdark, and it turned a lot of people off from a great story. 

      If you can keep going I would tell you that a major theme of the story is self-hate and redemption, and that Ruka, the cannibal in question, has an amazing arc.

  The author of Young Woman's Political Record has started up [Yashima Chronicles](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35875/yashima-chronicles), which is kind of a non-fanfic spiritual successor to YWPR.

  The main character is kind of YWPR!Tanya but with *even more* capitalism, and she's transmigrated to magical Sengoku-era Japan. 

  As of the most recent Royal Road chapter, she's been granted a LitRPG-style system interface and then immediately had it disabled (complete with sad trombone noises) because she refuses to play nice with the local equivalent of Being X.

  Thus far it seems like the arc of the first story is more along the lines of The Devil of the Rhine portion of Tanya's life, rather than the politics that happened in YWPR.

    Man, the tone of some of the Randian bits in this confuses me. Like, I think the author's making fun of it / caricaturing it, but it's so damn _earnest_ at times.

  So a new(?) recommendation I haven't seen here at least recently. 

  [A Thing of Vikings](https://archiveofourown.org/works/10408971) You'll need an AO3 login to view. 

  A Logical, but not completely rational of story where the How To Train Your Dragon island of Berk and it's characters are inserted into history around the time of the Romans. 

  Politics play out as an island nation of only a few hundred people now control Dragons as a massive force multiplier. Hiccup being an intelligent leader, understands this to some extent and controls the Dragons and favors he gives out in at least a logical fashion given his age, lack of global political knowledge, and general experience. 

  Battles and the like play out as curb stomps at first but enemies adapt and acquire their own dragons as an arms race hits full tilt. 

  Dragons as heat sources and in some instances replacements for industrial cranes and machinery, as well as Hiccup's own mechanical aptitude lay the foundations for the industrial revolution a few hundred years early, while skipping over and realistically missing some technologies as Dragons replace them or are not needed. 

  It's a bit long and drawn out at points, especially at the beginning, but teenage drama and feelings slowly fall away as the characters on Berk are forced to grow and deal with the outside world.

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      Book 1 (ch 1-31) for the most part is slow, the last few chapters here is when it picks up. By the end of book 1 all the changes from the movie to this AU are setup, most characters are introduced, and the playing board of world politics is set.

      Everything past this so far is playing out history with the Dragons as a part of it, which as we move along is further diverging from history as we know it, but in a realistic fashion I think.

  [Copy, Paste: The Misadventures of Milo Two](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34945/copy-paste-the-misadventures-of-milo-two) is pretty entertaining, and has a fairly rational POV character.

  - u/Prince_Silk:
    ```
    /r/ProgressionFantasy raves about the book, but I found it quite underwhelming. I dropped it like 3/4rths through the first book. 

    The whole story comes off as a the most cookie cutter version of a xanxia story there can be. The characters, setting and plot follow the exact style you'd expect and in the worst way. There seems to be no originality or soul in any part of the story.  

    The only real positive thing going for it is that it is written in English, but for anything else that you might care about in a story, any of the novels found on /r/noveltranslations are better.
    ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    I liked the first book a lot, recommended it here a bunch. I hated the every single one of author's other books, but thought he had turned a new leaf with this series. Maybe xianxia was his actual passion project  and LitRPG just paid the bills or something. 

    And then the second book was so godawful that I stopped recommending the series right away. It's basically the worst anime filler episode you can possibly imagine, put to book form. Imagine the novelization of 10 episodes of Goku running on the snake way, that's the gist of it. 

    Thankfully for the integrity of our reality the third book was not worse than that, but it was still bad enough that I've lost all hope that the author, Tao Wong, is anything other than a talentless hack who got lucky once, along the lines of that thought experiment with the million monkeys with typewriters.

  - u/tired1680:
    ```
    So, I'm going to recommend that you don't try the series. The book and most of the underlying philosophies are influenced by Taoism. If you know anything about Taoism, it's somewhat the opposite of 'rationality'. It won't tick the boxes you are looking for.
    ```

  - u/Judah77:

    Imagine the worst possible cliches in your Xanxia story, all distilled into one English mash-up.  That's Thousand Li.  It's Ok if you've never read translated Chinese novels about wuxia/Xanxia.  If you have, you'll hate it.

  Do people have recommendations for stories emotionally similar to [Game Theory](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1178710) and [its sequel](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1184729), or to [Of the Stars](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1220107/chapters/2498197)? I've been getting the urge to reread those, but last time I read them was recent enough that I don't think they'll actually land right for me right now. Those three are all by the same author, which leads to some natural clustering; but I'd be interested in recommendations for other stories by other authors with similar emotional tones.

  (I'm unfortunately struggling to figure out how to *explicitly articulate* the tone in question, beyond "the one that keeps popping up in a lot of the best magical girl stories". Otherwise I'd do that, so that people not familiar with the three linked stories could more effectively contribute here.)

  ...also, for those who haven't already read them, Game Theory and its sequel are *very good*, and I recommend them. Lots of nice beefing-up of the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha's worldbuilding, compelling character relationships, conflicts that make sense given everyone's actions and motives, generally excellent. The first few chapters more-or-less follow canon events, albeit with various expansions and minor divergences; but the divergences build up, and by the mid-point things are pretty dramatically departed from the canon.

    My closest recommendations - though it's been years since I read *Game Theory* - are:

    - [*To the Stars*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/777002/chapters/1461984) - *Puella Magi Madoka Magica* far-future fic.  Fantastic worldbuilding on the SF/cyber-non-punk side, surprisingly deep plot, best infodump I've seen in ages (character watches movie of their own backstory; much better than it sounds).  

    - [*Haigeki*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6892672/1/Haigeki) - *Ranma 1/2 / Sailor Moon* cross taken seriously.

    - [*Hakumei*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4119917/1/Hakumei), [*Vapors*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9855872/1/Vapors), and [*DÃ©jÃ  vu no Jutsu*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9255749/1/D%C3%A9j%C3%A0-vu-no-Jutsu) are three excellent *Naruto* fics on  the theme of competent-people-in-hard-situations.  The first is AU, the latter two reincarnation-ish.

    Apologies if I'm not getting the tone quite right, I'm stealing Game Theory to add to my own list of To Read so I'm not sure if this is what you're looking for. 

    [ReCreators](https://www.amazon.com/Re-CREATORS/dp/B06Y3KGYR3) plays with a lot of the Anime / Manga tropes including Magical Girls, letting the Meta interact as characters from some 'recognizable' but tweaked just enough to avoid lawsuits come to the real world and meet their Authors. 

    Past that and more into the weird Magical Girl kinda, [Qualia the Purple](https://myanimelist.net/manga/51493/Murasakiiro_no_Qualia). Which I'm not going to spoil as a bunch of it's twists are better blind.

    The obvious answer would be the current work of that author, [Impurity](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/impurity-worm-au.64859/) (Worm fanfic). For the "other authors" part though it really depends on what exactly you're looking for. The "dark and gritty but with lots of hope/fluff" part, the smart worldbuilding, or just the sense of everything going wrong in ways that totally make sense.

    I've been enjoying the webcomic [Sleepless Domain](https://www.sleeplessdomain.com/comic/chapter-1-cover), seems to have a similar feel.
    ```

      I'm following and enjoying Impurity, but I'm not finding it to hit the same emotional buttons for me; I'm not entirely sure why.

      Sleepless Domain is, indeed, enjoyable; I've been following it serially for a while now, but maybe I should give it a from-start-to-present reread and see if it hits the relevant notes for me. I don't *specifically remember* it doing so the first time around, but that was a while ago, and in terms of content it definitely *seems* like the sort of thing that might.

      The "dark and gritty but with lots of hope/fluff" part is a lot closer to the thing I'm after than the "everything going wrong in ways that totally make sense" part, I think; but it's still not quite the thing. (I wouldn't consider either Nanoha canon or Shadowjack's Sailor Moon recaps to be particularly gritty, even if they're both periodically somewhat dark, and they still have the thing; meanwhile, Higurashi: When They Cry *does* fit that criterion, but nonetheless *doesn't* have the thing.) I'm not sure *what* the thing is, yet, despite multiple attempts at introspection towards it and one long conversation about it with a friend.

  blindsight.space is releasing on October 12, and I'm 110% hyped.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    What is that? Some kind of fan project? 

    I loved Blindsight, but Echopraxia was too much ambiguity and obscurity for my tastes.
    ```

    - u/self_made_human:
      ```
      Echopraxia felt too self indulgent to hit Blindsight's high notes.

      We know that humanity had GAI around doing the heavy lifting, what were they upto, while the vampires took over, sleeping? I doubt it was something as stupid as them considering vampires to be just as legitimate as Homo sapiens, causing them to sit out the war, because we already know that there were arbitrary nation-states around, which implies not taking such a broad view of the whole affair. 



      They were also *horribly* blase about controlling the vampires, I'd have kept them outright paraplegic if possible, or genetically tweaked them to be weaker and slower physically than baseline humans. It's not like they had much in the way of rights, so what stopped them?

      Plus no end of other post-humans to keep the peace, unless they were all trivially neutralized somehow.
      ```

      - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
        ```
        General political incompetency would satisfy most of your points. More importantly though I felt Echopraxia to have the same tone as Blindsight - bleak outlook, no-clue-whats-going-onness, the big real life idea.
        ```

        - u/self_made_human:
          ```
          It crosses from general political incompetency to idiot-ball territory in my books, I'm not sure what your tolerance is!


          The very existence of GAI should have allowed for more robust fail states, while there must have been *some* reason to use Vampire brains for tasks as opposed to emulating them in software, nothing called for them to be left running around with just a single biological gun to their head, a gun that proved utterly ineffective. You should have cut them off at the spinal cord. 


          I can't imagine the system was robust at all, when the vampire could get around it by the simple expediency of *closing their eyes*!


          Additionally, Watts lampshades the problem by claiming that the vampires couldn't be kept in VR for a bullshit reason like 'they could see the pixels', if I remember correctly. Leaving aside that we can manufacture screens of density sufficient to pass today, if not commercially, that is a very lame excuse. You have options like laser scanning the retina like a CRT if that's an issue. 

          I'm not saying it's a bad book, but it takes liberties and ignores sensible solutions in a way that Blindsight never did.
          ```

          - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
            ```
            Maybe we just differ how much we trust humans to not fuck up. I'm very pessimistic these days and can absolutely imagine dozens of reasons why Vampires are running around as they are. 

            I'll have to do a reread with your take in mind!
            ```

          - u/kraryal:
            ```
            As I understand it, the "could see the pixels" was a lies-to-children version of "the versimilitude of the simulation didn't work for vampires for technical reasons that are related to their non-neurotypical visual processing" and was just phrased that way because the character didn't much care and didn't really understand it.
            ```

            - u/self_made_human:
              ```
              I'm not 100% sure whether it was the scientist protagonist who was the one who was told that, but he certainly seems like had the biological background to appreciate a more nuanced answer. If you recall that it was someone else in question, I would be more willing to accept that.


              Either way, I doubt that there's any real limit to VR in Blindopraxia, including full sensory immersive VR, and at worst, what are the vampires going to do about substandard fare, burn crosses to go on strike?
              ```

              - u/kraryal:
                ```
                The VR was mostly to keep people occupied since most people don't even work. Panem et Circenses. So the vampires just did their own thing, had their own social circles not tied to the humans, etc. 

                So not being in VR was part of the whole vampire rebellion background because a big part of society's keep people pacified mechanisms didn't work for them.

                IIRC the protagonist gets grief from his mother about why does he even bother having a job, he should be normal.

                Ah, I found it. The pixels line comes from Amanda Bates, the combat specialist character who is very much not an intellectual. The same page says vampires have a quadrochromatic set of receptors, and presumably the VR is still using RGB like we do...

      Yeah. It's a fan project that I think is a short film. It's been in production for a few years, and the author posted about it from time to time.
