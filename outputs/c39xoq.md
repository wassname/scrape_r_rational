## [RT][DC] Legacy of the Goddess: A Rational Zelda Quest - Prologue (2/2)

### Post:

[Prologue (2/2)](https://chaossnek.com/Story?chapter=A2) ~9.2k words.

This is the second and last prologue chapter for *Legacy of the Goddess*, soon to be hosted on Sufficient Velocity. I'll get the thread made as soon as Chapter 1 is completed. It won't be as long as the prologue chapters and it's already planned out, so I might even get to it this weekend! If not, next weekend for sure.

This one took a bit longer than I was expecting. We had set things up so that Impa would get to showcase her skills and in general be a badass. Originally I was going to dump something really nasty on the group. However, I was dissuaded from that by Radvic and persuaded by my roommate to do it fully simulationist as we would once the quest starts. I then went to determine what the encounters should be ... and nothing really happened. I wound up using the opportunity instead to hint at a bunch of worldbuilding. *hinting intensifies*

As always, hope you enjoy. Feedback makes authors happy! :)

  Rational!Zelda? With a crossover twist? 

  Interesting. I'm looking forward to seeing this quest in action after reading the prologue: I'm ready to smash some game mechanics like pots in the OoT guard house.

  Feedback: 

  * The maps could really use some scales 
  * Will resources (such as the players' current inventory, health, stamina (if applicable), magic meter (if that's also a thing), etc. be mirrored on [chaossnek.com](https://chaossnek.com) ? 
  * If users have technical issues with said site should they report feedback to you here on reddit via PM, start a conversation on SV, or will there be more functionalities on the website itself later on to address such issues?

  Also I'm guessing that the crossover is with Dune. Not because it make sense but because it would be amazing if you could pull it off.

    1 hex is 20km at the widest point. This is true on both the local and world maps.

    I have a number of offline tools to manage this stuff but hadn't planned on putting it on the site. I might cobble together a status page. Lower priority at the moment, though.

    You can report it directly to me anywhere you can reach me. Emailing admin at chaossnek also works.

    That is an interesting guess. :)

  If you would, please do make another post here (or just message me) when a thread of SV is up. I'd dearly like to watch it and was disappointed to find no SV thread and no way of subscribing to updates on the site the prologue is on.

  Definitely interested in seeing more of this. Keep up the good work.
