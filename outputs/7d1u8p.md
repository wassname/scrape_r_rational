  > “KILL THEM,” Nauk screamed.

  >“TAKE THEIR STUFF,” the Fifteenth screamed back.

  I'm so *proud* of the Fifteenth right now

  edit: oh fuck, those are some choice last words
  ```

    ```
    I know the first part of this chapter is hilarious:  
    > Warlord,” he grinned. “We got a plan?”

    > “Smash through everything until we’ve won,” I said honestly.    

    > “Ah, the Foundling gambit,” he gravelled. “It’s never failed us before.”  

    >“Don’t say that where people can hear, and that’s an order,” I hurriedly replied.

  ```
  Nauk can only be healed by fae? Looks like Killian is getting the sacrifices she needs
  ```

  - u/Mgmtheo:
    ```
    Killian, latest member of the Woe?
    ```

  - u/TwoxMachina:
    ```
    Burned by a Summer Fae duke, healed by a Winter Fae duchess (Cat)
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  > Archer’s arrow would have torn through his knee, if he hadn’t caught it. He raised a mocking eyebrow.

  > Then it blew.

  Ooh, nice reference.
  ```

  ```
  I think it's about time Catherine had some significant losses she really cares about.

  I wonder what the cost of Cat going full Winter is going to be?
  ```

- u/paradoxinclination:
  ```
  Cat and the Woe are working like a well-oiled death machine right now, they're going to need to piss off some real monsters to find more worthy opponents.
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    most of her men died and Thief suffered full-body burns
    ```

    - u/paradoxinclination:
      ```
      And they took down two hundred Immortals and a Baron at the same time when they thought they could only handle one. Losing Farrier and Nauk at the same time is rough though, I'll admit.
      ```

- u/panchoadrenalina:
  ```
  Cat fae now...
  ```

- u/DTravers:
  ```
  (I'm not going to pretend the following verse is any good, but the song is what I was thinking of after reading) 


  >Time has worn the soldiers down, marched for many miles...   
  In the lands of Sun so cursed,   
  Time to make a stand!  
  Baron has scorched this nation's life,  
  Nothing to be left,  
  Anger grasps the soldiers' hearts,  
  Mere six hundred strong!  

  ># LISTEN, YOU EXCUSE FOR A DUCHESS!   
  > #TRUST ME, THIS FIGHT HAS NO SUCCESS!   

  >(By Summer)  
  WENT TO CERTAIN DEATH AND PAIN,  
  CATHERINE'S SOLDIERS SAW THEIR BANE.  
  SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES IN VAIN,   
  BY SUMMER!
