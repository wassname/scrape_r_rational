  Oh man. OH MAN. It hit me what was going on a little before halfway through. Not ponies! ;s;

  THIS IS NOT A PLACE OF HONOR.

    Ponies live on a death planet only barely restrained by magic and a g rating.

    This author's written a lot of dark stories, which honestly vary in quality.

    Personally, I think that it could've been given a relatively happy ending by saving some of the victims with a genetic reset. With an undamaged reference piece of genetic material, magic could undo the genetic level damage without needing to rely on anentropic bullshit.

    Those are excerpts from the original document, which is much more comprehensive (though harder to read). PDF is [here](http://www.iaea.org/inis/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/25/040/25040772.pdf).

  When it hit me what they'd found: OH GOD NO.

    Yeah.  To make it even worse, the described symptoms couldn't happen if the inner containment was still working properly.  So one of the earlier groups must have been deliberately trying to retrieve the contents, and when the effects became clear the work continued anyway.  

    Luckily [this recursive-fic comment](http://www.fimfiction.net/story/42409/1/the-writing-on-the-wall/the-writing-on-the-wall#comment/1078069) fixes everything by explaining the story as an in-universe Daring Doo fanfic by Twilight.

  I don't see any connection to rationality, but it was, surprisingly a pretty good read. 

  The connection to the show is completely superficial, the story might as well have been about aliens, future humans, etc. Come to think of it, wasn't there a story like that involving aliens? I could be imagining things...

    Science is a thing.  Anyone with a scientific education figured out what was going on well before the characters had any idea.

  I've always wondered if the design would actually work.  If cautious scientists are the ones to discover it, then maybe they would work in from the outside, understanding each level as they went.  If so, they would back off and survive.

  What if, instead, the people to discover it were a bunch of wildcat goldminers?  Or some not-too-bright tomb raiders?  I've always felt that there are more of this type of people than of the cautious type, and it seems more probable to me that they would *not* take the time to investigate slowly, instead delving straight to the center to see "the goodies" or "the point of it all."

  What do you all think?

  - u/PeridexisErrant:
    ```
    I think the combination of curiosity and uncorrected anthropic bias - 'how dangerous can it be, we've always been fine before!' - would lead to it's unsealing very quickly.  

    IMO the best option would be to hide it as completely as possible, so that anyone capable of finding it will also understand the contents.  After all, "This is not a place of honour, nothing is valuable here" sounds exactly like what you'd say to keep people away, whereas "Warning, nuclear waste dump" in an unassuming hidden mineshaft just makes me want to stay away.  

    Make it as uninteresting as possible, and hope for the best... or better, avoid creating such waste in the first place.

      But only because you know what a nuclear waste dump is. The question is how to get that idea across to future civilizations that don't read out languages and may not even have an atomic theory.  

      EDIT: but yeah, I'm totally onboard with the "better to be hidden" because it would be opened otherwise.
      ```
