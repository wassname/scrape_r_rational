## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  I'm 23 years old and after 5 years of meandering through life, I'm finally going back to college. And this time I'm going to give it my all. No excuses.

  I'm going for a computer science degree, and hopefully I can work that into something that allows me to mess around with artificial intelligence. At least that's the dream.

  Money and time are going to be really tight because I'll be balancing this with a part time job. I have faith that I can make make it work though. And maybe down the line I can pick up some writing classes and actually start contributing to some rationalist fiction.

  This is a big step for me, so I just needed to share. How are your college lives going? Do you have any advice if you've been in a similar situation?

    If you want to do AI/ML, combine computer science with a double major in statistics.  Focus particularly on high-dimensional statistics and computational methods in stats.

    Find friends who are excited to learn and to make things. They'll be making side projects, showing up to office hours, and maybe even making/joining startups (or have tried and failed and still be looking). Joining their tribe will push you and change you for the better (if your goal is to do well in tech)

    If you want to get through your degree faster you might be able to skip your introductory CS class.  Online learning should teach you the same stuff.  Just ask your Advisor to make sure it's possible to skip.

  I've been reading *Democratic Confederalism* by Oxala, but he never explains what democratic confederalism actually is.

  Developer [Sean Murray's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVl1Hmth3HE) on creating No Man's Sky's universe from procedural art generation. I loved the part about the algorithms setting up rules for the world. And the planets and animals generated dependent on things like how far the planet is from its sun - so what'll be its water content and climate be like, subsequent colour of the sky.. It's so beautiful. Been really looking forward to this game for a while.
  ```

  - u/BadGoyWithAGun:
    ```
    It seems interesting at first glance, but I've yet to see a procedurally-generated world that could compel me to explore as much as a carefully hand-crafted one. Unless they're doing some truly novel procedural magic, it's the same old tradeoff between quantity and quality.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I'm really curious whether this is going to pan out or not. The idea of an exploration heavy game appeals to me quite a bit, but it really comes down to implementation. The reviews will probably let me know whether it's worth a purpose. (Like you, I love procedural generation.)

  I'm contemplating alternative story telling techniques, such as using a Wiki site to combine lots of disparate vignettes none-linearly, character anecdotes and 'appendices' into a broad structure that tells it's own story. Anyone have thoughts on that?

  On the other side of things I'm contemplating just what a game focused more or less entirely around the mechanics of diplomacy and politics would look like.

  At present I'm mostly thinking most of the mechanics end up being about making agreements.

      I got a copy from a friend full of his notes, in black pen, based on what he'd figured out (and references he'd uncovered) while reading. I added my own notes in pencil and gave it to another friend. She added highlighter and green pen cross-referencing a lot of our comments with the existing editorial footnotes.

      Sadly, at this point the pages are falling out.

    I recommend taking a look at [Undum](http://undum.com/) or [Twine](https://twinery.org/). They're designed for interactive fiction, making games with words. It's not what you're asking, but the sorts of possibilities you're describing haven't been heavily explored.
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Do you know of any story games that currently uses Undum? I would like to see it in action beyond the tutorial.
      ```

      - u/Sparkwitch:
        ```
        Undum hasn't gotten a lot of attention because it's harder to use than other similar formats. [The Play](http://squinky.me/theplay/) is probably the largest example, but it's essentially a CYOA. [Matter of the Monster](http://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/matter/) is very short but shows off by wandering around the page.

        It's a powerful system, and produces the best output so far as I'm concerned, but there are only a few great examples of what it can do.

    I am usually very frustrated by this sort of thing. I love complex stories, but I hate complicated story-delivery mechanisms. Usually I give up on a piece of fiction if I can't easily figure out basic things like what order I'm supposed to read it in.

    (I anticipate there are many readers who strongly disagree. The above is meant only to be a single data point about my own personal preferences.)

    Sounds vaguely SCP-like. Maybe with shades of other creepypasta stuff, like the Slenderman "mythos".

    It'd probably be good for horror.

  How do you guys go about writing stories? For the last few weeks I've been working on building a magic fantasy world for my first real story. But suddenly today I had an amazing idea for a VRMMO. Specifically I knew exactly how I wanted it to end. Therefore despite it currently being three am I wrote the whole epilogue and am now planning to start writing chapters of this story instead. Do you guys write your stories through slow world building? Or like me did lots of you have sudden ideas that you just started writing, with the ideas simply seeming to come to you?

  Which video games do you prefer to watch *with* commentary? Which video games do you prefer to watch *without* commentary?

  ---

  In my opinion, video games can be grouped into three broad categories for this purpose:  
  **1\.** Too simple to benefit from explanation  
  **2\.** Too complex to be explained in real time  
  **3\.** Both complex enough to benefit from explanation and simple enough to be explained in real time

  *More detail:*  
  **1\.** Most platforming games, for example, are pretty simple. The controls are universal--moving and jumping, and maybe some other items such as running/dashing, gliding/hovering, or long-/high-jumping. Anyone who's playing **or watching** a platforming game knows at a glance *exactly* what actions he wants the on-screen character to execute. There's no need for a commentator to explain what he's doing when the viewer can understand immediately what's going on.  
  **2\.** Most fighting games, for example, are pretty complex. The controls for executing a move as simple as an uppercut could be completely different between *The King of Fighters*, *Street Fighter*, and *Super Smash Bros.* A person casually watching a fighting game has no idea what buttons are being pressed by the player, and cares only about watching the on-screen spectacle of the battle, which progresses at a pace too quick for a commentator to explain in a satisfactory fashion. If I'm watching a match of *Under Night In-Birth*, I *might* be interested in hearing someone explain how one move was an exact counter to another move--but there's never enough time for such a full explanation, so the commentator will instead regress to saying, "Oh! That was a great anti-air DP!" Even if I know what an "anti-air DP" is (a rising attack used to knock a jumping enemy out of the sky), I really don't care about the tactical background of the action if it can't be explained *play by play*, and discussion of such matters only drags me out of immersion in **the spectacle of the battle,** without replacing it with anything as satisfying.  
  **3\.** In the middle of this spectrum are games that are simultaneously complex enough to need explanation and slow enough that they can be explained in real time. For example, in a slow-paced game such as *The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth*, there's always enough time for a commentator to explain **in detail** the rationale behind his choices, since those choices are separated by long periods of repetitive combat that doesn't need much explanation beyond a few simple tactics (which are mostly obvious, as in category 1).

  *Example videos:*  
  **1\.** *[Yoshi's Woolly World](https://youtu.be/DGltXcyF5cQ?list=PLYpDU5ElRBflrhZPqUBKxYshDOvLvPK02)*, *[F-Zero GX](https://youtu.be/dQ8vMW4QOOc?list=PL3hRSOp8fv1hqPrsf9H-I9mN27_QVFgEi)*  
  **2\.** *[Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja: Storm 3](https://youtu.be/bT0sWD9USyE?list=PLoVvUkh9FSa6yK9Pk5dIlnBaS8M1syJrm)*, *[Tetris](https://youtu.be/VNbo1AGqKrI)*  
  **3\.** *[The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth](https://youtu.be/ht5mh8spRk0?list=PLABGXtjmzmht9w4MlsuaVX0cG4pKiL6JO)*, *[Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft](https://youtu.be/ZUIqkps1Dms?list=PLvEIxIeBRKSjKqEBrSl0ymGmiWjvferrh)*
  ```

    ```
    From category 3, Crusader Kings 2 videos specifically from Arumba. His videos on CK2 are very educational and are part of what convinced me to buy the game in the first place.  

    From category 2, CS:GO videos from WarOwl. Although my interest in Counter Strike fades by the day.

    I like watching people do building games with commentary and people who kind of 'wear their reactions on their sleeves' in games so I can get a more honest feel for how the mechanics confuse, frustrate, delight, amuse, annoy etc.

    This is honestly more of a "game developer taking notes" thing but it's super useful.
    ```

  - u/Anderkent:
    ```
    Pretty much every game I'd be interested in watching would benefit from player commentary. Unless the game really is trivial (in which case why are you watching it), having the someone explain the players thinking (not every move mechanically, but the things they're focusing on and current goals) makes it much more entertaining.
    ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I really enjoy watching turn-based games, where the person playing can take as much time as they need to make their decisions and explain their process. X-COM, Darkest Dungeon, Europa Universalis, Hearthstone, Crusader Kings, Civilization, games like that. I tend to like turn-based games more than real-time games anyway.
    ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    I enjoy watching Dota 2 much more with commentary. There's a lot going on and having people discussing things can help make sense of things. 

    I don't watch a lot of games without commentary.
    ```

  - u/brandalizing:
    ```
    For fighting games, that only really applies if the commentary is simply play-by-play, which is the basest form of said commentary and definitely not the most interesting. You don't need to know which buttons are being pressed to understand that one of the players is spacing his attacks better, or seems to be playing more patiently.

    The best Smash commentators talk about the players' playstyles, the general flow of momentum and what a player may need to do more of in terms of ideas, not physical button-pressing.

  ##Why did you make this latest script?

  I noticed the misuse of certain phrases on r/relationships such as "open and honest communication" and "brutal honesty" and thought I'd make a joke based on it. The former is used in a way that is often not meaningful, and the latter is usually code for being an asshole. Why not make people more honest?

  ## Examples

  #### 1.

  > I'm an otherwise normal person, but because I am brutally honest, people dislike me. It's sad that I can be disliked just for my brutal honesty.

  becomes

  > I'm an otherwise normal person, but because I am an asshole, people dislike me. It's sad that I can be disliked just for my assholery.

  #### 2.

  > The secret to romantic success is open and honest communication. If you focus on open and honest communication, you will have a good relationship.

  becomes

  > The secret to romantic success is having a good relationship. If you focus on having a good relationship, you will have a good relationship.




  ## Do you hate honesty? I think honesty is great.

  No, I don't hate honesty. It's just fun to see how these word replacements end up working out. These filters are *for fun* should never be used seriously or if you are over, under, or at the age of 45.

  ## Using this script

  This script works with [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/). There are also other tools that will let you use it. 

  You can find the script here: http://pastebin.com/raw/7XgH0hQr

  ## Some great examples:

  * "I'm sorry you are going through this pain. For some reason your assholery about your feelings and rational behavior makes your sadness very real to me. I hope the best for you and your son."
  * "The point is that the relationship fills a void or is free from a stresser that is in your relationship. Assholery is the first step, if you can both actually do that"
  * "Let me tell you something, when someone says they are 'an asshole' - it's not about honesty. It's a way assholes excuse shitty and bad behavior."
  * "He sounds like one of those assholes that uses 'I'm just an asshole' as an excuse to be an asshole. NOPE."
  * "One of the reasons I fell for him was how totally, an asshole he was."
  * "As far as him telling her, your boyfriend is an asshole remember? He tells everyone pretty much exactly what he's thinking as the thought runs through his mind...."

  And the grand finale:


  * "After spending some time in this sub, I think 'my SO is an asshole' is code for 'my SO is an asshole'"
