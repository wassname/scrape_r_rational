## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  A reader of my story *Delphic* suggested I present Hector's situation for munchkining. Minor (not major) spoilers ahead. 

  Hector lives in Detroit in a modern superhero setting. Technology is roughly equivalent to our Earth. Hector has the ability to View any time in the past between 1950 and the present, in any location on the Earth's surface (upper mantle to low Earth orbit). He can widely control the angle, position, and "playback speed" of what he sees. He is limited to a normal optical vantage: visible (and very near UV) light. He can freeze and carefully observe a particular "instant" (approximately 8 ms minimum resolution).

  Super powers exist, but are mostly physical. A power like Hector's is not publicly known. No powers are known to break timelike causality (there is a lightspeed delay when Hector Views a distant 'present').

  In Book 1 of my story, Hector has been making money by taking FBI bounties and providing information to super teams. What else should he be doing?

    * Solve any missing persons case by verifying when a person was last seen and fast forwarding through what happened. 

    * Find out location of current kidnapping victims. 

    * Find out if there was another shooter for JFK, falsify / verify other such conspiracies 

    * get any login / password combination you want that was written down or entered into a system 

    * Look/Listen in (via lip reading) on Board Meetings and other such get togethers and glean information that Hector then uses to inform investments (effectively insider trading camouflaged as talented trading)

    * Corporate espionage (patents, formulae, â€¦)

    * suffer soul-crushingly from watching any murder you want without being able to save anyone

    * verify any crime (requires the judicial system to trust you, of course)

    * Check your backside without turning around (are you being tailed? Do these pants make your bum look fat?)

    * Uncover the secret identity of anyone who made a public appearance in the last sixty years.

      Lip reading does seem like a must-have skill.
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        I do not believe that lip-reading actually works with any accuracy. My assessment of what I have seen/read is that it is mostly using body cues and situational awareness to infer meaning, and in any case where the info is not already known (such as names or addresses the person is not already cued for) the accuracy level is 'educated guess.'

        If anyone has done reading/research on the subject, my mind can be easily changed.
        ```

        - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
          ```
          Wikipedia didn't really give any useful numbers, and [this article](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602949/ai-has-beaten-humans-at-lip-reading/) on lip reading deep learning programs agrees with you. 

          However, Delphic has an advantage the humans in the last, most realistic, test (that had an accuracy of 12%) does not have - he can change the angle and speed of his viewing, repeat it as many times as he likes, and compare with the other participants of the conversation, written notes, powerpoint slides etc. that are present. 

          Unless it is important for the plot that he does not "hear" anything, I think that he would want to address a clear weakness in his power in some way.

            Thank you; I will continue to look into it.

            Although I haven't brought this up in the story, the idea is that Hector made some very costly mistakes early on relying on lip-reading, and came to the conclusion that it is more likely to give him false information than actual new information. He deliberately avoids doing it so as not to bias his conclusions.

            As the story progresses, it would make sense that he would continue to make efforts to resolve this limitation, because adding the ability to understand what people are saying would be a *significant* power upgrade. I do not intend to limit it arbitrarily for story reasons.

              Lip reading is at best only 30 to 40% accurate. It's because there are too many sounds that form the same lip shape when speaking. Try looking in a mirror and silently sounding out 'pat', 'bat', and 'mat'. Lip reading is only used in situations when one can know fairly easily what the other person is likely to say such as speaking to a cash register at a grocery store. My source is American Sign Language classes in college which taught how poor lip reading actually is.

                Could he put his viewpoint into another person's mouth and observe the tongue? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIUvX7hebBA seems easier to transcribe letters out of one at a time.

    If he likes the government, he could do *way* more for the CIA than for FBI bounties.  

    Any type of forensics becomes almost trivially easy.  (Oh look a dead body.  A wonder what killed them.  A sniper bullet fired by that guy who was hired a week earlier by that other person.)

    Diagnosis of machine problems is also easy.  Did you know that it takes tens of thousands of dollars to ship out workers, rent a lift, etc. to inspect a wind turbine?  If he can do it while it's running, all the better.

    Search and rescue, Amber Alerts, missing persons, etc. are all of mixed value, but also easy.

    Check if he can see 68 lightyears away (at "present" time), or if there's some other strange interaction.  Do astronomical research.

    Coordinate with a satellite monitoring system, and get him to focus on things they notice.  This would massively increase their utility and his.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Some great ideas, thank you.

      His View won't rise above low Earth orbit. There is a legit reason for that but not one that has yet been revealed in the story.
      ```

  - u/mrdoomydoom:
    ```
    How long does the mental processing for the ability (i.e. deciding what to view, selecting a place and time, etc.) take? How long/often can he use the ability? 

    Since it works up until the "present," he can just choose to view "the time from X+1ms ago until 1ms ago" (where X is however many milliseconds it takes to use the ability) repeatedly to give him effectively-current vision from any spot on Earth.

    Even if repeated usage causes mental fatigue, or if the "processing" takes enough concentration to preclude training himself to repeatedly select the same location as soon as a 'video' ends; he could still use it that way intermittently to get the equivalent of "bursts" of omnivision X seconds long that are 'out-of-date' by X seconds. 

    I'm assuming that by "until the present" you mean "until the *beginning* of the playback" - if you meant "he can only view things that have already happened *by the time he views them*" then his 'omnivision' wouldn't even have to be delayed: He'd just have to start an X-millisecond-long viewing at some location from (1ms before the mental 'start' command is given) until (X-1 ms after the command is given). Then, at every point during the viewing, he's still technically seeing 'the past,' but the net effect is that he effectively just sees what's currently happening.

    The last one might be a bit too OP though, so if you'd rather avoid it just clarify that whatever 'video' he wants to view has to 'end' at some point before he starts to view it. Even then, though, he could still just continuously start new, extremely short 'videos' (as in the previous paragraph) as quickly and for as long as he could. 

    Honestly, unless it takes a notable amount of time or concentration to 'focus' on a particular 'video' there's nothing else that I can see really stopping him from doing this. Even if there is, though, a slightly 'out-of-date' version of "X-Ray Vision, but as far away as you want" is still super OP and much more obviously munchkinable.


    I haven't yet read your story, so I don't know what Hector's goals are, but when you say most known powers are 'physical' I'm guessing super-senses aren't unknown. So if he wanted to moonlight as a 'conventional superhero' he could use the above technique (or variations along the same general lines of Viewing things from an extremely short time ago until the present) to fake 'standard' X-ray vision, or a 'human/object sense', or really almost any number of enhanced senses. 

    Or, considering he's already working with the FBI, I can imagine they'd find someone who could spy on anyone, anywhere, in nearly real-time incredibly useful. Depending on how high his 'security clearance' is, the CIA would love to have him, too.

    TL;DR: The power as written could effectively be used as if it was a "See arbitrarily far away with a delay" power; the utility and munchkinability of which I probably don't need to point out.
    ```

    - u/None:

      Yes, Hector can View the distant 'present' (lightspeed delay applies) with no difficulty. Present clairvoyance is a heavily-used application of the power.

  An omniscent god feels like answering a yes/no question for you. To avoid ambiguity, you will be allowed to ask as many (possibly open ended) questions and follow-up questions as you want. However, your memory of the question and answer session will be erased afterwards, except for a single yes/no you choose to send to yourself.

  What's the best you can do and with what strategy?

  Edit: To clarify, you don't remember any of the questions you asked either. You only remember either a yes or a no.

    Just as the first way to do this that comes to mind, ask the God the open-ended question: "At what digit of pi does the sum of all useful human knowledge, in order from most to least useful, appear, when translated from decimal to English heptavigesimal, and heptavigesimal increments through the latin alphabet from A to Z and a blank." Then, ask for your yes/no question: "Is the [number] digit of pi the digit where the sum of all useful human knowledge..." etc.

    Alternatively, ask the God what question you should ask in order to lead to the best situation by your personal morals via butterfly effect. Maybe its weird, but if the open-ended questions must be answered truthfully, then there you go.

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      Pi hasn't been proven to be a [normal number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_number), so it's not actually guaranteed that this will work. It's suspected to be one, though.

      Additionally, the answer to your question is almost certainly too deep into pi to compute the numbers, probably so large that you won't be able to actually say the digit because it's so long, and maybe even so large that the amount of information needed to remember the number is more than can fit in a volume of space the size of a human brain.

      However, I like your approach of using the answer as a formality and the question to store data. You could just ask "Sorting all humanly useful knowledge from most to least useful, what's the longest statement I can remember?" then "Is [that statement] true?"

    [Gamorra](#s " Found the soul stone and decided to keep it a secret -  immediately tells someone else she knows the secret. Poor Opsec to say the least.")

    [Thanos](#s " His motivation is overpopulation and over-exploitation of the resources of the universe. However killing off half the population of the universe just doesn't solve that problem.

      I have the sneaking suspicion [spoilers](#s "he actually created two universes, one of which has the remaining person, and the other for all the people he "killed." Not for any in-universe reason, but because there are movies announced for several of the characters who died. Specifically, Spiderman Homecoming 2, Guardians of the galaxy vol 3, black panther 2, and Dr. strange 2 (this one is unconfirmed though.\) There's another avengers movie planned for 2019, though, where many of the main avengers have their contracts expire, so what might happen instead is that they sacrifice themselves to reverse thanos's actions.")

  You have a time travel device where you can get information from the future. It will answer only yes or no to any question you ask. However, it can only answer questions about a hypothetical future where the device doesn't exist.

  So you can ask 'will it rain today?' or 'is the number I wrote down the winning numbers of tomorrow's lotto?' and get accurate answers. However, questions like 'will I lose the device tomorrow' or 'will I be alive tomorrow' would most likely give wrong answers or no answers at all, because the question is only answering about a hypothetical future where you don't have the device and it isn't influencing your actions. So questions about your future actions will only be about a version of you who suddenly doesn't have the device.

  How would you use it to make money in the shortest amount of time? The device's fuel will only last for a week before it dies and you need to make a million dollars or more to buy more of the fuel within the next week before it breaks down permanently. The device can answer questions beyond the week of its battery life if needed.

  For hard-mode, the device can only tell information of the future within the next week.

  For nightmare-mode, you have earn a million within 24 hours instead.

  For abyss-mode, you need a million within 24 hours and the device can only tell you about the future within the next 24 hours.

    With this machine, you can break any cryptographic challenge.  For example, here's how you would exploit bitcoin.

    The size of the nonce for bitcoin is 32 bits.  Find an appropriate nonce, and you get a mining reward.  Now, everybody else is doing this by brute force.  Test a nonce, and if it fails, increment and try again.  With this time travel device, you could solve the problem much quicker.

    * Get a bitcoin miner whose nonce can be manually specified.
    * "If the first bit in the nonce is set to 1, will the program terminate sooner than it would have had the first bit been set to 0?"
    * Set the first bit according to the answer given.
    * "If the second bit in the nonce is set to 1, will the program terminate sooner than it would have had the second bit been set to 0?"
    * Set the second bit according to the answer given.
    * Repeat.

    On average, there is a new block found every 10 minutes.  So long as you can repeat this process in under 10 minutes, you'll win, on average.  Each time you win, you get 12.5 bitcoins, or about $125,000.  Do it 8 times, and you have your million dollars.

    Heck, if the querying to the device could be automated, the bigger problem would be making sure that you don't leave it running and crash the bitcoin economy.  Bitcoin is based on the idea that no one entity could perform the majority of the mining.  With this time travel device, you could easily outperform the rest of the miners combined.  If this fact became known, bitcoin would immediately lose all value.

    2. Ask questions about a future where you use the duplicate.

    Actually hold on a second. What are the limitations on this device's ability to tell the future? Normally time travel involves future you sending data to past you, but in this case it seems to be the opposite as the device cannot tell you anything about your personal future since the device is influencing your future. 

    So what are the restrictions on the information gathering ability of this device? If I ask the device: "One hour in the future, does god exist?", will the device know the right answer? What about "One hour in the future, does P = NP?"

    Or what about information I normally cannot get? Like finding out who murdered someone: "One hour in the future, has suspect X ever committed murder before?"

    Or better yet, use the device for research and inventions. "Do the laws of physics one hour in the future allow me to build a super profitable invention within a day using what I have now?" Then play twenty questions to narrow down what this invention is and what steps you need to take to make the invention.
    ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    Is there a limit on the number of questions you can ask? If not, this is really really easy. To the point where even abyss mode is a joke. Just look for a good lottery that will end within 24 hours, perform a binary search using the device to get the winning number, and buy a lottery ticket with that number. 

    Don't ask "is the number I wrote down the winning value?" That takes too long. You need binary search. Ask questions like "Is the winning number greater than 20?" If yes ask if it is greater than 30, if no ask if it is greater than 10. This will let you determine the winning numbers really quickly.

    The only way you could fail the abyss-mode challenge is if there was somehow no way to gamble in the next 24 hours. But that's ridiculous because stocks and lotteries are everywhere.

      > you need to make a million dollars or more to **buy more of the fuel within the next week**

      The question isn't asking for how to make a million dollars, but rather how to make and *get* the money within a week. Lotteries often have a delay of 4 to 6 weeks before payout, so it's too slow to win the challenge.

      People talk about how easy it is to make money with time traveling powers, so this challenge is how to get some large amount of money *quickly* with time travel.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        You can just borrow money to pay for the fuel first and then win the lottery to pay back your loans. Though I guess the question here is how much of a loan can you get. You can sell your house and car and organs and whatever, since you know you can just buy them back later.

    The Swiss still have numbered accounts?  If so, I'd binary search for the number & authentication code for the largest abandoned account at some major bank.

    That should get me $1M, via wire transfer, in the next 24 hours.

    If we're gambling, I'd do horse races as well as the lottery.  A "pick 6" bet would have sufficiently absurd odds, and a non-trivial chance to pay cash.

    If that didn't work (and we're assuming the rest of the SCP canon doesn't exist) then the item would still be extremely useful because it can generate free energy through many different means, so post-singularity civilization won't ever have to fear the heat death with this thing around.
