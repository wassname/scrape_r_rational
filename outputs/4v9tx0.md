  My favorite answer to this comes from /r/asksciencefiction, "[\[Fallout\] It's been 200 years. Can someone sweep the fucking floor?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/3t39qe/fallout_its_been_200_years_can_someone_sweep_the/cx2yn76)"

  > > Why is everything still like the few months following the blasts?

  > Because it _has_ only been a few months.

  > Think about it- 200 years, and you can still find scenes of dead bodies exactly how they were when the bombs fell? In poses that even the wind or wild animals would have disrupted, much less raiders? Houses look half-destroyed, but not rotted or decayed? Edible food inside untouched areas? Things wouldn't look like that even 10 years after the end... but they did look that way 10 years after. And 50 years after. And 200 years after.

  > The worst effects of the bombs could never have been predicted. The first few months were terrible for the survivors. And they never really got better. Or worse. It's been a few months since the bombs for 200 years now, and every year is the exact same as the one before.

  > Because War.

  > War never changes.

  Chilling stuff.

  [Of course, I have my own opinion.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceFiction/comments/3y41ge/fallout_is_the_world_really_doomed/cyali8s)
