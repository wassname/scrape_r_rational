## Rational audio books?

### Post:

I loved MoL by Jack Voraces, do you know of any other good rational audio books?

### Comments:

- u/GullibleCynic:
  ```
  [Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality](https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=56)

  [The Metropolitan Man â€“ by Alexander Wales](https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1705)

  [Other Rational audio readings](https://hpmorpodcast.com/?page_id=1096) (Three worlds collide is weird but good)

  [The Goddess of Everything Else](https://sscpodcast.libsyn.com/classic-the-goddess-of-everything-else) (rational-ish mythology)

  [The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant - Prof. Nick Bostrom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxXwiMTYPCo)

  [Friendship is Optimal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXwg-6PLXIWYlG8Z_N4evqWezQ_LIGwVf) (reality doesn't grade on a curve)

  Im sure there is more. But it is a rather new 'genre', and rather hard to write (and even more difficult to write well)

  ```
  If you're willing to pay for a commercial audiobook, I'd recommend [Automatic Reload by Ferrett Steinmetz](https://www.google.com/search?q=automatic+reload+ferrett+steinmetz+audiobook).
  ```

- u/Dragongeek:
  ```
  There's a free audio-version of *Unsong* which is a fantastic story.
