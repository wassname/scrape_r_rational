  Uhm, take three ebookreaders, a handcrank, solar panel, miniature windmill, a couple of USB cables, printed Documentation of all the relevant Codecs on two different types of "paper", throw in a couple of light microscopes and a couple of these nifty micro-writing disks https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Project with your choosen Texts, and take all the books you want. 

  Are you aware of freesfonline.de?  Biggest link Archive to freely published SF/F  I know of.
