  *Glimwarden* is about small town politics in a fantasy land where magical lanterns are the only thing stopping an incursion by vile creatures. The glimwardens are powerful magic users who have made a sacred covenant with the city of Light's Hollow and pledged themselves as protectors. The story follows three people -- two boys and a girl -- during the construction of the town's eighth lantern.

  I should be posting chapters three times a month from here on out.

    Similar to RWBY's concept, I see, given that their whole civilization is besieged by creatures of the grimm.

      Yup. Civilization in a losing war of attrition against some huge threat is one of my favorite tropes. RWBY, Attack on Titan, Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, Aeon Flux ... heck, even Wayward Pines. I think I like the isolation and near claustrophobia of it, it's somehow cozy.

            Between this and the protagonist's name, I have definite proof you like Sanderson. 

            I don't yet know what I will do with this knowledge, but I'm sure it'll come in handy someday.

              Jokes aside, one of the reasons I picked up Shadows of the Limelight was that the writing is very similar to Sanderson. Great worldbuilding, clear style, and just enough prose to work with.
              ```

                ```
                Gotta say, I love Sanderson's prose. I've seen some criticism of it being simple, but it's perfect for me - I can just *devour* pages of it easily, but it doesn't *feel* simplistic. It fits really well with his doorstopper books.
                ```

          That's something none of those series even hint at, which is a wasted opportunity to me. It'd be so easy to throw in the implication that the world wasn't always as brutal, that something changed in the past- which makes it a mystery story as well. If you've ever read The Games We Play, that's one of the main draws in my opinion, but even in canon it could fit well- the Grimm themselves don't seem like a natural phenomenon, and what happened to shatter the moon? Given the way the world works on myths, it seems like it's easy to theorize and fill in the gaps for yourself.

          Attack On Titan has the same implications to me, it seems hinted that the Titans were created by humans and finding out what happened is more of an incentive than the action, imo.
          ```

      - u/daydev:
        ```
        But is it a losing war? From what we've been shown so far, it seems that civilization is slowly *winning* the war of attrition. Something along the lines of *Steerswoman* meets *Dragonriders of Pern* (with or without the Lost Technology angle). I suppose, glimlight-resistant darklings could show up just in time for the plot to mess things up :)
        ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      The problem with RWBY is that we are continuously told that Grimm are a big threat, but we don't _see_ it on screen. If that was the case, cities would be actively defended. But Hunters aren't guardians - we don't see them defending borders. We see them _hunting_ - offensively, in small groups of people and far from civilization. Only exception was when Grimm invaded city because of human fault. And Ironwood said that only Atlas has any military besides Hunters... There obviously is a lot more going on behind the screen, but it really doesn't feel like the world is threatened by them.

  Ooo! New story from alexanderwales? Time to get back to pledging you on Patreon.

  Say whatever happened to your plan on posting one more appendix for Shadows of the Limelight?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    I'm probably going to wait until either I'm rearing to go on the sequel series or putting *Shadows* out as an e-book (which will probably wait until I've finished writing and editing some of the other stuff that's in the backlog). I mostly just got burnt out on the second appendix, because it's partly a survey of the history of illustrati and the history of the science of illustrati.

    (I've lately been trying to get better at managing my writing efforts so that I'm producing things at a steady pace, and one of the ways I'm trying to do that is in recognizing where that effort will get the most returns. The second appendix is on hold until its effort/output ratio is better, which mostly depends on my enthusiasm.)

      >Sequel series

      Yes please Mr. Writer Man. Yes *please*.

      If you're planning to do the age of gunpowder illustrati, by the way, the Powder Mage series has some excellent uses of that ability.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Oh, I'm a big fan of the Powder Mage series. I actually met /u/brianmcclellan at GenCon two or three years ago; he was on a few panels at a writer's symposium and had a lot of interesting stuff to say. There definitely isn't enough gunpowder in fantasy though, so I don't think I'll feel too bad about covering a little of the same ground.

  I really enjoyed Shadows of the Limelight and Metropolitan Man, have to read your other works still in my huge backlog of stories.  I hooked it up on your Patreon for $2 which is really a pittance but I hope more people will do the same for you!

    Thanks! Be sure to check out *The Case of the Sleeping Beauties*, which should be in the creator posts on Patreon, since that's one of the only ones that's not web published.

  I wonder if the forcefield means people build vertically more. I also wonder what the effect of a highly-concentrated field is - if two fields overlap, is the effective field strength at the point just the higher value, the additive value, or something else? If it's additive, then it might be more efficient to build in rings, so you get a good deal of area too far from any given lantern to be safe consecrated by the influence of overlapping fields. Especially if the lanterns are moveable.

  The other thing I'm curious about - do smaller darklings spawn more or less easily than larger ones, or is it the same? If smaller ones spawn more easily, and a trained professional with tools can dispatch them fairly easily, then working on the peripheries of the field is probably pretty safe, so long as there are guards. You wouldn't want to sleep there, maybe, but arable land is arable land. Also, if you have a hill or mountain with inhabitable or arable slopes, putting the lantern inside it might consecrate more surface area than otherwise - just as a lantern tower in a valley would, come to think of it
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:

    I don't think there's a strong incentive to build upward. Here's my reasoning as to why:

    The UN FAO says 0.5 hectares per person. That means that if you want to feed all 11,000 people within Light's Hollow, you need [55 km^2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=11,000+*+0.5+hectares) of land. Average American household size is 2.5 people, average American [single-family detatched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-family_detached_home) lot size varies greatly, but Seattle DCI [has a great PDF](http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cs/groups/pan/@pan/documents/web_informational/dpds021570.pdf) that shows *their* range, from 5,000 square feet to 9,600 square feet. If we're being pessimistic, that means [roughly 4km^2](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(11,000+%2F+2.5\)+*+9,600+square+feet) to house everyone. R/C/I ratios vary a lot, but let's say 2:1:1, which means a total of 8km^2 in order for everyone to have space to live.

    In other words, with a lot of unfavorable assumptions, we've got a 7:1 agriculture to living ratio.

    If you perfectly selected a 63km^2 plot of land, you might be able to get better than 87% arability, especially if you could convert non-arable land to arable land through chemistry or landscaping. But eventually you're going to reach a point where you run out of farmlands to feed the people, and I think in most cases you're going to hit that point far before space is so precious that you're pressured to build vertically. This does mean that proportionately more buildings would probably be on cliffs, hillsides, etc.

  Question regarding the prologue:

  > Eventually a second lantern was constructed, doubling the available area and making the town more secure.

  If a Lantern's sphere of influence grows over time then how come the second Lantern immediately doubled the available area? Or is the growing hava thing only something that was true for the first Lantern? In which case it is still interesting that a new Lantern apparently is immediately of the same size, indicating that the original was somehow diminutive at first?

  Care to shed some light?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Lanterns have a permanent ball of hava sitting in the center of them that grows or shrinks in size as darkling hearts (which are really just balls of hava themselves) are added to it and shrinks in accordance to the burn rate and evaporation effect.

    The process for building a second lantern usually involves something that looks a lot like mitosis; grow the ball of hava in the center of the first lantern, then when it's grown large enough, quickly split it in half and carry it over to where the second lantern has already been built and slot it into place. This obviously takes some engineering efforts in order to make sure that service isn't interrupted for long enough that the darklings attack.

    In this case the original *was* diminutive in size, since it was a travelling lantern only engineered to allow for a caravan to travel west relatively unmolested by the darklings. The first thing that the glimwardens and engineers did when they founded their town was to begin increasing the size of their lantern, which made it more efficient, which gave the glimwardens some breathing room because they didn't have to collect quite so many hearts to feed into it.

    (There are other rules and engineering concerns involved, but some of that is to be revealed later and some of it is just worldbuilding wankery.)
    ```

    - u/Bowbreaker:
      ```
      Doesn't that mean that the creation of a second Lantern initially didn't increase the protected area at all until both Lanterns were once again stocked up to the pre-mitosis hava levels of the first Lantern?

      Also, I assume that Lanterns can either only hold a max amount of hava or that there are considerable diminishing returns after a certain point? Because otherwise the smartest thing to do would be to just dump it all into one uber-lantern.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        As Sander says in the first chapter, gliminance follows the inverse-cube law. Since surface area increases by the square and power needed increases by the cube, that means their relationship is given as power^2/3 = area.

        Or to put it another way:

        Power|Area|Radius
        --|--|--
        100|21.5|2.6
        200|34.2|3.2

        ... or for that same 200 you could instead have *two* circles that give you 42.5 area. Except they're not actually circles, that's just useful for doing math. Instead, they're fields. So if your safe field strength cut-off is *x*, then making a second lantern of equal strength to the first doesn't just double your available area, because there are going to be places where both lanterns would individually be below *x* but sum to above it.

        I haven't actually done the math to see what the result is, but I think doubling is close enough, especially since every writerly bone in my body resists putting something like this in the prologue.

        (There are other reasons not to build lanterns *smaller* in order to get more coverage, namely the evaporative effect which dominates cost-benefit analysis at the low end.)

        Hopefully I haven't screwed up the math anywhere here, if any of this makes it into the text itself I'll have to take some time to triple-check my numbers and actually do some field strength calculations.

          I was wondering about that. The inverse cube law is a really weird choice for something that seems to work like EMR. You usually see an inverse square law because of 3D spatial symmetries. The only inverse cube laws that come to mind are from dipole moments.

          Was that on purpose? Why that choice of falloff function?
          ```

          - u/alexanderwales:
            ```
            Yes, it's on purpose. The reason will be explained (much) later.

  Light's Hollow is west of Tor Ellsum; so presumably this should be the great cities of the east?

    Fixed that, thanks.

  Interesting. I'm sensing a lot of *Dark Souls* inspiration here.

  Edit: and also a bit of *How to Train Your Dragon*. :)
