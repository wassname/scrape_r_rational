## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  This week I scraped SB for reading material:

  *Pound the Table*: Person gets inserted into (AU) Marvel setting as a mutant, becomes a high powered lawyer. Interestingly, having outside context knowledge is almost less of a deal than simply being a successful and competent woman in the early 1990s. Has some of the usual "problems" with the insert-genre, like how the protagonist inexplicably is related to or runs into people who will be or are notable individuals. 

  Generally, I liked this. I am not even remotely a legal professional, but the author seems to be one... or at least the legal drama comes across as more authentic to me than something like *Suits* or *Daredevil* while still keeping it fun and dramatic. There are also multiple complete and satisfying arcs and plenty of word count, which also made this a treat. 

  In terms of "rationality", it's a bit hit or miss: the legal and courtroom stuff is solid and engaging, and clearly feels like "professionals being competent" however the protagonist occasionally vacillates between highly confident / self-assured and a less stable state with poor decision-making. 


  -------------------------------

  *I want to help*: Post-GM Worm insert into Marvel. Decent enough. Basically, Taylor joins SHIELD right before the main events of the MCU kick off (with the Hulk) and becomes the defacto lead of SHIELD's newly-formed "parahuman" department. She personally focuses on aligning it more with the PRT/Protectorate's ideals, in that a large focus is on protecting powered individuals from mis/ab-use by bad actors. 

  The author has chosen a *wide* scope of what is Marvel canon, including, eg. the *Agents of SHIELD* with their Inhumans and such.

  I am interested in seeing where this is going: currently, it looks like the author is going to kick off the HYDRA-reveal-arc where Taylor uncovers the internal infiltration, and considering a Taylor who already has severe reservations about the way in which SHIELD operates, it will doubtlessly be interesting. 

  ------------

  *Sanity is Subjective*: SWTOR SI, some poor schmuck gets yoniked into Star Wars and ends up rapidly pushed through Sith-diplomat bootcamp and out into the galaxy. Has a very "we trained him wrong, as a joke"-vibes coming from the Sith, which is hilarious. This is definitely a fun read above all else, however it does have serious and darker moments (the reality of the Sith Empire), in between the protagonist fumbling his way into success.

    I'll give a thumbs up to Pound the Table. It's a bit slower of a fic, and things are always kept at a 'personal' level while still having large scale MCU events borrowed from comics and movies happening in the background. 

    I'll qualify the MC being stupid / illogical at points. Shes' a good lawyer, but not a godly always right / hyper competent. Same goes for her personal life and decisions. She's not got the energy to be hyper competent and logical every second of the day. 

    Definitely a positive that there are multiple well defined arcs in the story. I usually come back to this one after every arc completes every few months.

  Two western animated shows I heavily recommend to everyone here. Not necessarily rational - just *good*.

  [Scavenger's Reign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWQH8cMpWTU). 
  Sci-fi, follows evacuees of a spaceship trying to survive on an alien planet.
  It feels.. fresh. Genuinely interesting and new. Lots of fun speculative biology - it feels magical. It has a fairly emotional plot. It immediately charmed me and just kept going until the end.

  [Lastman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ6CPq0H8IU). Modern adventure with fantasy elements. Short, bite-sized episodes with excellent pacing. Fun main character. A bit of a rollercoaster ride that just doesn't slow down. Great soundtrack.
  ```

  - u/hoja_nasredin:
    ```
    scvanger 's reign has awesome ideas. But imho the plot is too predictable as it follows the modern hollywood sensibilities too closely
    ```

  - u/ansible:
    ```
    > ... Lastman ...

    I tried to go to lastman.tv to view the series, or at least see what streaming service it was on and/or how much it cost, and I get a pop-up asking me install a browser plug-in. No thanks.
    ```

    - u/Dragongeek:
      ```
      The only place I've found to watch it is on [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/lastman-2016-season-1-s-01-852x-480-avc-x-264-aac-lc-the-best-english-dubbing/Lastman+-+S01E01+-+You%E2%80%99re+an+asshole+Aldana.mp4). It's basically lost media at this point, since it is not on any streaming platform that I can find nor is it available for purchase anywhere.
      ```

    - u/Kodix:
      ```
      I can't even access that site, or find it on google. 

      Regardless - you can watch it on [prime](https://www.primevideo.com/detail/Lastman/0M8KP48GY3PR9WT8G8AZA72PGI) and [hbo max](https://www.max.com/gd/en/shows/lastman/316f704b-5775-4b53-8fc0-b047ad416410).
      ```

        The trailer has it in the description presumably at some point in the 7 years the domain lapsed and was captured by a bad actor.

    Scavenger's reign looks amazing, surprised I haven't heard of it before. Thanks for the recommendation!

    - u/Kodix:

      I'm sincerely glad it appealed to you! Hope you enjoy!

    Anyone on the look out for quality western animation should look up the science fiction film [Mars Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okQT4Sk4e8Q). It's very good. The production quality, the animation, everything is very impressive.
    ```

- u/SecondTriggerEvent:
  ```
  Uplift fiction is fun. What non-fiction books would be best for learning the process behind scientific advancements? (Technology evolution over civilizations, how that technology was made, et cetera...)
  ```

  - u/CellWithoutCulture:
    ```
    The two main ones I've seen are:

    - The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch - Book by Lewis Dartnell
    - Ryan North-How to Invent Everything

    Then of course there are prepper books like the Military survival guides, encyclopedias, and "Great Science Textbooks Library"
    ```

- u/Weerdo5255:
  ```
  So, a new one for me at least [Prophecy Approved Companion](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/35549/prophecy-approved-companion). 

  I would say it's one that's worth getting the audio book for, given the multiple talents and effects added to it. 

  Its litrpg in the sense that it's a game, but more interestingly the narrative point of view is from a game character that glitches out. 

  Glitches out due to a game tester who is intentionally trying to break the game, manipulating physics glitches, trade glitches, teleport glitches, sequence break, etc. Having a character see all this, and slowly have to come to the conclusion that their world is just broken is entertainingly fresh. 

  The glitched NPC attempts to fit what's going on into game logic, and failing resolves to come back and investigate later after the world is saved from the 'big bad evil emperor'. Which only hints at the NPC gaining more actual intelligence, something which the Devs for the game actually pick up on and attempt to test. Which is another bit of refreshing storytelling. 

  Some indie devs realize they have AI, freak out, but don't try and kill it or do anything drastic. 

  Overall it's good, not the greatest story ever, but entertaining enough that I purchased audio book 2 and I'm going though that now.

    Agreed, it's a good effort but not great. Just about avoids overstaying its welcome. 

    At times you really have to stretch your suspension of disbelief if you know anything about game engines.
    ```

  - u/i_dont_know:
    ```
    I read most of this while it was being written, and remember enjoying it, but eventually dropped it. I can’t remember why. Might have just intended to wait for a few more chapters.

    Just purchased the audiobook. 

    Not the biggest fan of the narrator or the chosen one’s voices.
    ```

    - u/Weerdo5255:
      ```
      It is kind of hard to determine if the Chosen One is supposed to be so annoying or not, he does calm down a bit in the audio when he realizes hes not 'alone' in the game.
      ```

- u/TopAbbreviations3385:
  ```
  there's a fic that I'm pretty sure was recommended here but that I can't find now - I wonder if someone remembers?

  it was about a girl who contracts as a magical girl during some kind of monster attack on a massive shopping centre (?), where special vaults exist for people to hide in during attacks. eventually the saferoom her class is hiding in is sealed from the inside by someone panicking, and to save them from suffocation(?) while awaiting rescue she has to go to the power generator in the building and fix it / defend it from the monsters
