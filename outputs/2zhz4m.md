  **Bullet attraction** is actually a superpower in Brandon Sanderson's *Mistborn* series. It's a subset of a bigger power of pulling metal towards you, but the way they attract bullets is to pull them in towards the core of their body, which they keep heavily armored for just that purpose.

  **Invisibility in the dark** is basically just "conditional invisibility". How useful it is depends on what we're defining as darkness, but it could be a very useful stealth power, allowing midnight burglaries without setting off motion detectors, being caught on camera, tripping lasers, etc.

  **One second super-strength** depends on what the refractory period is, and how much strength is granted. I would have to crunch some numbers, but if the numbers were right, you might be able to use it to drive a specially made generator. One second is also enough to throw a single punch, though there you're limited by whether you also get the required secondary power of limited invulnerability.

  **Absorb bad luck** implies that you can give someone good luck. Sure, this sucks for you, but that's why you have a trusted confederate. You suck up all their bad luck, they go buy a lotto ticket, and hopefully you don't get struck by lightning in the meantime. If nothing else, it's at least a service that you could get paid for.

  Also, pretty much any of these would let you win Randi's prize of a million dollars, aside from "turn into a laptop forever" or "seduce hats".

    Amusingly enough, bullet attraction appears in another Saderson series, *The Stormlight Archive*. Practitioners of a certain lost art can infuse an object to make it attract projectiles. Late in the first novel, *The Way of Kings*, a character uses this to protect his army squad from hails of arrows by infusing his shield.

    Depending on the range and intensity of your power, you could sit your ass down in an armored tank and drive through battlefields acting as a living "aggro magnet" for your allies.
    ```

  - u/Sailor_Vulcan:
    ```
    It doesn't say that you can choose who you absorb bad luck from and how much bad luck you absorb from each person. How do you know the bad luck you absorb won't gradually make you more and more unlucky in your search for clients? The more bad luck you absorb, the less likely you are to find a really unlucky person, and the less money you will earn. Once you've gotten a reputation for improving other people's luck, people who are already very lucky (and if you're particularly unlucky, people who aren't very generous) will come to you and have you absorb what little bad luck they have. When they don't see a significant difference in their luck, they will be less likely to pay you as much, if at all.

  **75% levitation** = super jump. Plus you'd be able to control your arc by adjusting your levitation force mid-air.

  **Remote control of remote control**: bind remote controls to your devices. You now have technomancy.

  **detect trash**: potentially useful for detecting forgeries or defective parts.

  **read own mind**: if that means anything, that means extremely enhanced introspection, and that is very very useful.

  **super slo-mo**: this may grant a defensive buff ranging from OK to significant depending on the implementation.

  **revive bugs**: I imagine this could be a million dollar talent in the market of rare bug collectors and transporters. Imagine a collector who wants to see their specific of an extinct butterfly fly again.

    **revive bugs**: possibly unlimited food source, depending on the implementation. Can you revive a bug that has passed through a digestive system?

    You wouldn't even have to eat them yourself, you could just grow chickens and feed them with mealworms (which are the larvae of the mealworm beetle) and then turn the chicken poo back to chicken food?
    ```

    - u/philip1201:
      ```
      If that works, then reviving bugs is basically equal to "have any organic material explode into bugs". Life on earth has existed long enough that pretty much every carbon atom in the biosphere has been part of a bug once. Revive those bugs, and you destroy the present container.

      Even if there's a reasonable time limit, you could revive the bugs someone swallowed yesterday and remove/revive *micrograms* of bug atoms from their body, killing billions of cells.

    - u/IWantUsToMerge:
      ```
      This seemed silly to me, at first, but I think there's a way to make it work. Much of the time, when a bug gets killed, it gets killed by having digestive enzymes injected into its body, then having its jellified guts sucked out through the same hole. If you can reverse that process, you will need a means of regenerating working insect guts.

      The question is, what's the easiest way to extract the guts without completely destroying the body, is it worth it?
      ```

  - u/psychothumbs:

    That's a good point about the bugs. I wonder how of how many extinct species of bug we have enough samples lying around to revive the species.

  ```
  **Read your own mind**, if it's actually a superpower (as in "more than normal capabilities") sounds like a kind of supercharged introspection that would allow you to reflect on your own thoughts and where they came from, and perhaps thereby make yourself more aware of your biases and mistakes.

  **Trash detection** could, in particularly poorly cleaned areas, be used to increase your situational awareness - inferring what else is going on around you by how it disturbs the trash.

  **75% Levitation** suggests you would only need a little extra thrust to achieve "full" levitation, and even if you can't find yourself a 25% jetpack it might at least make you lighter on your feet, more agile, able to jump to great heights.

  The picture for **acid tears** suggests that the problem is that they immediately flow into your own unprotected eye, but if there's a helpful Panacea/Bonesaw-type around, you might be able to have yourself modified to move your tear duct, so that you express acid from somewhere more useful.

  **Control remote control** is a matter of perspective - who's to say a remote control couldn't have sharp edges or an attached explosive charge, at which point it becomes a mentally controlled levitating weapon. Or you could control a large number of the things to build them into some sort of agglomerated structure - build impromptu walls and bridges to control a battlefield, or swarm an opponent with the weight of hundreds/thousands of little plastic bricks.

  **Summon a lamp...once** is of limited use since it's a single-shot but you might get something useful out of it by stretching the definition of "lamp" - anything that emits light could be considered a lamp, so you just need to will yourself into summoning into existence some sort of omni-useful progenitor device... with a light.

    This is actually one of the powers in the *Mistborn* series by Brandon Sanderson. You can store your weight in metal bands worn around the arms and wrists (called metalminds), making yourself lighter while you do so. This is used for extra agility, to decrease falling damage, and to jump higher. Though it's a tad more useful there, because you can store closer to 99% of your weight (and, of course, extract it).
    ```

    - u/chaosmosis:
      ```
      > Though it's a tad more useful there, because you can store closer to 99% of your weight (and, of course, extract it).

      Wasn't there a time component as well, letting it exceed 100%? If I'm remembering right, one person had saved up their weight power for a really long time, allowing them to become super dense at a certain point.
      ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        Yup, you're basically storing "units" of weight/rate that you could measure in poundhours, and when you're not storing, those units are just sitting there waiting to be used. I don't think there's a limit on how many units you can use at one time either, aside from common sense. So if you need to weigh a 1000 pounds for a minute, you could get that by having stored up 16 pounds for an hour.

        There's a *Mistborn* RPG that I have at home that gives all the rules for this which the novels sort of gloss over. IIRC there's also a limit based on how much metal you have available to you to dump weight in.

        (And weight is only one of sixteen attributes that you can dump and then pull out.)

              ...yes it does, Sanderson misnamed it in Mistborn either deliberately or by accident.  I made a thread about it [here](http://www.17thshard.com/forum/topic/888-effects-of-iron-feruchemy/) a few years ago.  It has practically every quote related to the use of Iron Feruchemy from the start of Mistborn to ch. 6 of Alloy of Law, as well as analysis on all of it.

              Good news: even if a person stored up their mass for 20 years and "used" it all in 1 ms, they still wouldn't be dense enough to form a black hole. They would, however, extert a large (~500 GN) force on whatever they were standing on over a relatively small area -- even the compressive strength of diamond would not be able to hold up to that much (~10 TPa) pressure, so you'd end up with the person depositing a pretty large amount of energy into whatever they were standing on. And their own body. So the biggest danger to someone nearby would probably be shrapnel, not a black hole.

  Battery from Worm could be described as having one second super-speed and strength. It was pretty worthless before she understood her limitations, but once she did and learned to work around them, she managed to stop a villain who was repeatedly breaking villains out of the vehicles transporting them to the inescapable prison.

  There's a character in League of Super Redundant Heroes who can telekinetically control cats. Being able to do that with remotes would work pretty much the same, but without being considered animal cruelty. You could tape remotes onto everything, and fly using a sufficiently large pile of remotes.

  Doze from Homestuck has super slow motion. He's difficult to kill because of it, but he's also pretty useless.

  Talking to fruits would be useful if they had some understanding of what's going on, but if they could only tell you things they could reasonably know like rainfall, it's pretty worthless.

  Bullet attraction is incredibly useful. You could disarm your opponents by pulling their guns out of their hands. It never said the bullets have to be fired.

  75% levitation would make flight a lot easier, so you could probably make wingsuits practical. You could also generate electricity by almost levitating on the way up and not on the way down.

  Summon a lamp once could let you kill a supervillain by summoning it inside his head. The problem is knowing you have the power.

  Turn into a laptop forever would make it vastly easier to upload your mind into a supercomputer, so you can think faster than a normal human. You could also mod your mind to make math really easy and stuff like that.

  Define "hat". You could put someone onto your head and then seduce them. It's especially effective if you have a team member with super strength.

  Depending on the range, strength and controllability of the bullet attraction, it could be incredibly useful. Maybe you could pull the bullet toward you before it's fired, at a slow enough speed that it's harmless. Still, only really useful if you get shot at a lot.
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    You could use it to disarm people, since they have bullets in their guns. Like if you're in a room full of armed people, if they haven't drawn their weapons, you can just telekinetic ally summon all their ammunition, easy. I'm sure you could find a way to use this against bullets that have already been fired, but it would be MUCH more useful against bullets that haven't been fired yet. 

    In effect, not too different from the disarming spell from harry potter. Guns aren't super useful without bullets

  Okay, let's see...

  Acid tears: I can't see an upside to this.

  Invisible in the dark: low rated stranger power, great for covert missions at night.

  Remote control control: depending on the strength of the TK this could be great.

  Communicate with fruit: aaaaaaand I'm no longer a vegetarian.

  Trash detection: could locate sentient alien life via detecting their trash.

  75% levitation: energy from nothing, entropy is solved.

  Summon a lamp once: ...does this power obey the Manton Effect? If not, it's a good assassination tool, because no one will believe you had anything to do with it, and even if they did all tests will show that you can't summon lamps.

  Bullet attraction: wear sufficient armour and summon all bullets everywhere. The world is now much less armed.

  Read your own mind: very useful rationality tool.

  Instant hairloss: ...I got nothing.

  Abnormal armhair growth: see above.

  Absorb bad luck: absorb all bad luck everywhere, the rest of humanity now only has good luck.

  Super slow-mo: slow your body to the point where time passes at a rate of 20 years per second for you. Instant cryopreservation.

  Revive bug: team up with Skitter and take over the bay.

  Ultra fast aging: this isn't a superpower, it's a progeroid syndrome.

  Invisible handwriting: hide evidence by liquifying it, then writing using it as ink.

  1sec super strength: Become a boxing champion.

  Turn into a laptop forever: unless the laptop runs an emulation of your brain, or has something really useful for humanity on it, this is just suicide for no good reason.

  Seduce hats: ...

  Desaturation: allow scientists to study the effect you have on EM radiation, leading to breakthroughs in physics.
  ```

- u/Nepene:

  Acid tears. assuming this lacks immunity to acid, a very bad power. If not it serves as a way to do touch attacks.

  Invisibility in the dark. In mild moonlight. Very strong power.

  Control remote control. Could be very useful, depending on how hard you can throw it. Could you attach a spike to the end of the remote control and use it as a spear? Attach a bomb?

  Communicate with fruit. Since fruit isn't sentient, is this making them sentient? If not, then it's not really a super power- anyone can do a one way communication with fruit.

  Trash detection. Hide some trash in someone's car, homing beacon. Throw trash at someone, now you can see them in the dark, even if they're invisible in the dark. Very useful power, depending on the range.

  75% levitation. Potent speed boost power, would let you run very fast.

  Summon a lamp, once. Very weak powers are predictably not very useful. If you can summon any lamp

  http://www.greatestcollectibles.com/pink-lotus-lamp-fetches-2-8-million-expensive-lamp/#.VQnaATWshN8

  Summon a lamp like this worth 2 million, or a lamp made of pure platinum fifty feet high.

  Bullet attraction. Attract them to an armored body part.

  Read your own mind. Useful for introspection I suppose.

  Instant hairloss. Useful for disguise purposes I suppose. Perhaps if it really does instantly vanish the hair you could use it to get rid of radioactive waste? If you could do it to others you could give haircuts or threaten people with hairloss if they didn't help you.

  Abnormal arm~~c~~hair growth. Depends on how abnormal.

  Absorb bad luck. Useful service to sell.

  ```
  Bullet attraction would be easy, just get a job as a guard protecting the pope, president or world leader and wear a vest.

  75% levitation is not bad, if you can control it while running or jumping, you've essentially become as agile as an airbender and as light on your feet.

  Absorb bad luck would be interesting. Go to children's hospitals, become a saint. Or go to a racetrack, and make your buddies rich by betting on the wrong horses.

  1 second super strength means you can still do devastating kicks and punches if you can time it really well. 

  Super slow motion can stop you from crashing or falling onto something.

  Invisible in the dark? That means you can become batman if you always fight at night and keep yourself covered in a shroud or cape.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Bullet attraction could be heavily abused on a battlefield. Construct a movable bunker, basically just huge walls of lead carried on the back of a sturdy tank, and parade it slightly off to the side of your rushing forces. Bam, your troops can now close the gap.

  Alternatively depending on what "bullet" translates to this could be used to assist orbital strikes in their accuracy.

  Invisibility in the dark has basically created a perfect nocturnal assassin that can't be caught on film or with infrared. 75% levitation, if that applies to things you're wearing, means a person could carry almost twice the equipment of the average soldier/laborer. Have them use their power on an entire train car which is attached to their shirt then save 75% of fuel costs & undercut all shipping competitors. Reviving bugs could be used to decimate competitors crop fields, imagine bugs that refused to die despite the use of pesticides just continually eating your crops despite the fact they're covered in poisons.

  * Control remote control: With a custom-built "universal remote control", you can control a computer with your mind. Neat trick. Alternatively, build a sharp and heavy remote control and use it as a weapon.
  * Communicate with fruit: Utility depends entirely on how much information is available to fruit.
  * Trash Detection: Good for disposal of hazardous materials. Sweep an area to check it's clear of biological or radioactive waste.
  * 75% levitation: I assume this means you can make yourself 75% lighter? Great for climbing.
  * Summon a lamp once: Summon it phased through another object. Hope for an explosion.
  * Bullet attraction: Wear bulletproof armour and all the bullets will hit you instead of anyone else.
  * Read your own mind: True self-awareness! See your own cognitive biases in action! Mind powers are always the best.
  * Instant hairloss: Instant disguise.
  * Abnormal armhair growth: I simply cannot think of a use for this one.
  * Absorb bad luck: Okay, bear with me on this one. Go to the casino. Bring a friend. Bet on the roulette wheel, red or black. Your friend bets twice as much as you, and on the opposite colour. You'll lose a lot of money, but they'll gain twice as much. Split the profits, then try the same stunt on the stock market.
  * Super slo-mo: Slowmotion your way past the boring parts of life!
  * Revive bugs: Work in conservation, protecting endangered species of bug.
  * Ultra fast aging: Instant disguise that only works once. Adequate way to avoid being carded when buying alcohol.
  * Invisible handwriting: Nope, I'm stumped here.

    It depends on the definition of "abnormal."  If it means "ridiculously fast", then shave it frequently and use it to stuff pillows / insulate your house / weave cloth / whatever.

    If it mans "armhair that is made of palladium"...win!

        That's not a superpower, that's what happens when you hold an ice cube in your hand.

        Otherwise, I have a superpower.
