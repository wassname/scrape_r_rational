## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  A Random Omnipotent Being (R.O.B.) is offering to give you superpowers/magical power.  However it wants/needs interesting results: a good “narrative” in which the power isn’t too OP.  To this end you can add complications or conditions to the power, allow the ROB to give rivals/nemeses opposing powers, and/or allow the ROB to manipulate your life setup a few narrative plot threads in your life to force the circumstances of your power usage to be interesting.  If you don’t propose good complications/rivals/plot threads the ROB will add to them.  With each power your propose you can either negotiate further and learn how the ROB will alter the bargain (to which they can respond further with their own alternatives or modifications to the scenario) or go in blind and get stuck with whatever the ROB chooses.

  Additionally, the ROB adds a condition: the more you negotiate with the ROB to find out the exact limits you can get the weaker your powers will be.

  I’ll role play ROB, and you can propose a superpower/magic power and your complications/rivals/plot threads and either ask for negotiation or go in blind and I’ll tell you how the ROB responds.

  If I’m slow responding other people can role play the ROB.

  If anyone wants to play ROB: I and 107 other random people around the world gain the ability to craft minor magical items.  Unfortunately one of these people alerts several governments and now every major world government seeks to control these people.  Going in blind, so whatever complications/enemies/plot threads you add are in.

    I think the best way to go about it would be to try your best to setup a Good vs Good conflict, one where there are two sides in general agreement about improving the world, but differing in what the eventual utopia is going to look like. To that end, I think I would probably focus on space colonization so that I can set up an augmented space race/exploitation narrative. The best contrast, IMO, is going to be myself as a scion of otherworldly expansion, while my enemies will be focused on Earth boosterism.

    To that end, I give myself teleportation and the ability to tag people as teleportation delegates, capable of making any specific teleporation traversal that I've already made with them (or that they've made with another teleportation delegate), all of this pegged to gravity wells somehow so that when you teleport to Mars, you're actually teleporting to Mars, not to where Mars was twenty minutes ago. This power *also* has some scalability, because once I've gone through the trouble of traversal, my delegates can do their own trips and expand the network, so long as I have people tagged in. Beyond that, it *also* gives some narratively convenient complications, like who gets trusted with what, jockeying for position within the org structure, secret bases that only a trusted few can teleport to, etc.

    My opponents, meanwhile, will be among the Earth Booster League, competing with me largely for resources and personnel in their quest to make Earth the shining central jewel on humankind. If my end goal is the rapid terraforming and colonization of planets, which requires people, technology, and seed materials, then their powers should also be dependent on those same things. (I've decided that they're a League, rather than one individual, because that allows for there to be more narrative arcs that can develop.)

    Maybe there's a branch who have the power to make materials, one who can generate lots of common metals without the need for mining, another who can do refining, another who can make physically impossible materials, etc., and make it so that some of them don't scale particularly well, which creates pressure and tension, which is narratively good.

    Another branch has special power over people, with one capable of sharing skills and knowledge, one capable of enforcing agreements, one who can biologically boost people, etc. You'd have to be careful about this branch, I think, but it would broadly cover the personnel and org challenges, giving the Earth-boosters a leg up.

    The core of the idea is that we're not actually interested in sabotaging each other, and we both do best when we do best, the but the inherent conflict is inescapable, and at the end of it, the competition for humanity's future is going to leave people better off one way or another.

      Each new person established as a teleportation  delegate lets a floating teleporting tentacled extra dimensional monster (kind of like a giant squid) into reality.  Each new teleportation traversal established causes an existing extra dimensional monster to grow to kaiju size.  The non kaiju sized ones can be taken down with anti-armor weapons but the kaiju ones need heavy bombardment to kill.  The monsters aren’t especially hostile generally staying on Earth but away from human (the smaller ones eat fish and the kaiju ones hunt whales) but they are attracted to the usage of Earth Booster League powers, meaning that usage of your teleportation power creates a direct threat to the Earth Booster League.

      These extra dimensional monsters can spawn more after eating enough, about as often as a giant squid, so it isn’t simply a matter of hunting them down as they spawn if a few manage escape and reproduce.  On the plus side, studying them and harvesting them, and then heavily processing them can make a serum that can grant people copies of your teleportation power.  Of course, if teleportation powers aren’t carefully regulated this could be a downside in the long run.

      The Earth Booster League powers, on the other hand, causes amorphous rock creatures to spawn and develop.  Creating and refining material causes their initial spawning deep in Earth’s crust.  Refining material and creating impossible material lets them develop enhanced durability and increased movement speed. Using the social coordination powers grants them the ability to organize and congregate across vast distances. These rocks creatures are repelled by Earth based life, but seem to need gravity and open space to at least some extent, and they can float, leading to them tending to travel to the Moon and other astronomical bodies after spawning.  They are initially only as durable as the rock they are made out of, but they have no clear central organs and most be broken into small pieces until no piece is bigger that 1/10 the original to properly kill them.  They can slowly reproduce by continually occupying an open area with no carbon based life and rock beneath them and seeding fragments of themselves into the rock, converting it after several years into new rock monsters.

      The rock creatures instinctively dislike carbon based life, which will lead to them attacking larger colonies established on other astronomical bodies.  If the Booster League has used their powers continuously and heavily, and the rock creatures aren’t exterminated as they spawn, it could in the long run cause every rocky body in the solar system to be uninhabitable to carbon based life.

      So both the teleporters and the Booster league will need to come up with some regulations and restrictions on power usage and enforce them or else monsters will run rampant.

      As a plus, the rock creatures and extra dimensional monsters are naturally hostile to each other, with the extra dimensional monsters drawn to the rock creatures like they are with the Earth league powers, so if there is unrestricted and unregulated power usage maybe they will fight each other?

    My superpower is an infectious meme/infohazard that causes people to engage in ways that are closer to "in good faith". One complication is that as the point-source for the infectious meme, I will be as affected by it as everyone I infect with it put together.

    Fully blind otherwise, because whatever.

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      You have the power as described and it works reasonably well, even against trolls, but occasionally you interact with people that are outright insane, causing the good faith effect to force everyone to seriously engage with the insane belief, you most of all, and their insane view points propagate through you.  Thus you periodically have to engage in wacky debates and debunkings such as (for example) explaining why the CIA aren’t listening into or why Jesus isn’t communicating through alphabet soup.

    For my purposes, I'd want a setup that enables lots of drama and entertaining conflicts while aiming to improve the world with the secondary effects. The first genre that came to mind was sports, so how about this?

    Everyone gains the ability to manipulate their own biology. At a baseline they can accelerate their healing, cure themselves of any chronic health conditions including ageing, turn off pain at will, and if seriously injured they reflexively enter a state of suspended animation until they recover.

    However, with practice, it's possible to slowly shapeshift beyond the bounds of the human form and introduce new features found in nature, or indeed anything that's biologically possible. 

    This would fix lots of issues with the human condition for everyone. Ideally the power also removes the need for outside sustenance, so that even entropy isn't a concern. However, to reduce the power level it could instead respect conservation of energy and be made to operate more slowly.

    In terms of narrative, my proposal is that it is four years until the first Olympic Games in which use of this power is permitted, opening up every competition to a vast variety of optimized body plans, and my mission is to compete to win as many gold medals as possible.

    Naturally, along the way I'll encounter rival athletes with different philosophies for how to best use the power, such as whether to focus on enhancing the physiology of the human form, to turn into the most suitable animals from nature, or to become something entirely new that's focused on a specific task without regard for any other requirements.

    As a backdrop to this will be all the societal changes. Anyone can choose to walk away and subsist off photosynthesis without needing to engage with the rest of humanity, and people will want to optimize their biologies for all sorts of different goals. That's not to mention how it will affect spaceflight, animal rights, warfare and law enforcement, dating and romance, and so on. The Olympic Games will therefore also serve as a platform for many of the arguments about how it should be used to be expressed during the events.

    I think negotiation is necessary to avoid the risk of the resulting changes having bad outcomes, and weakening this power will still preserve most of the global benefits.

      Accepted, and everyone gets the higher end version which cheats conversation of mass/energy a bit.  Enough so that world hunger/nutrition is no longer an issue and shapeshifting doesn’t need a special diet to fuel it.

      In addition to the friendly but high stakes Olympic Game, however, you also have to deal with terrorists that have a quasi-religious (and in some cases actually religious) obsession with the purity of the original human form.  They have targeted both the games as a whole for highlighting “deviant human forms” and you specifically for being one of the leading shapeshifters.  The most extreme terrorists are planning bio weapons that will target those that utilize the shapeshifting the most.

      You can renegotiate further, but then the power will start requiring more biomass/energy, enough to make high-end frequent shapeshifting something only people with expensive diets can perform.

    "Ah, well you've come to the right guy. The only thing preventing my life from being near-maximally entertaining and narratively engaging is a bunch of irrelevant bullshit, and with the addition of knowing you exist, I already have all the superpowers I need. 

    I propose the following deal: You restore my physical health to that of the average fictional protagonist, and fix the *boring* parts of my mental illness that keep me from doing the crazy heroics and stunts of willpower I am already inclined towards and gets me back to where I were before all this bullshit that last decade or so has consisted of happened. You tweak the rules of probability in my narrative to work according to the rules of good writing, where the protagonist can't be randomly killed of or the world destroyed without proper foreshadowing in some way completely unrelated to the plot so far, and a good end is guaranteed conditional of the protagonist acting in good faith putting in a sufficiently superhuman amount of suffering and hard work and heroic sacrifices and so on and doesn't fall to their Tragic Flaw. I give you the most spectacular narrative of infinite hubristic ambition transcending ontology and all other bounds. Once I finish slash become the Friendly AI Singleton, if and only if it's actually friendly, you hook it up with whatever larger context let you become a ROB and whatever power I could have argued for here but didn't, to continue that story and attempt to one day eclipse even you. Feel free to throw in some other worldbuilding curveballs to keep things interesting, if needed. Either way, I'm going in blind."

    "Adam West Batman?"
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      To work that down into a power set:

      * You have the ability to string together irrelevant and absurd details into a coherent and true key fact, particularly when investigating crimes, but also when trying to understand people’s actions or motives or behavior.

      * You have a propensity for designing and utilizing gadgets.  The gadgets are often single usage and only good in the exact situation you end up using them (for example a grappling hook that can catch a particular buildings’ ledge just right, but wouldn’t be good in other situations).  You tend to build and carry the exact gadgets you end up needing.

      In return however:

      * criminals are attracted to the city you live in and feel motivated to adopts themes and motifs and gadgets/gimmicks of their own.
      ```

      - u/grekhaus:
        ```
        "Deal!"

        (The idea here is to exploit the converse of the negotiation = less power clause, by limiting negotiations to a single digit number of words. 'Adam West Batman' was chosen, on the basis that such powers would implicitly shift the 'genre' of the world toward the sort of conflicts which happen in a particularly campy, low-powered superhero setting, as opposed to anything incredibly destructive or intractable, as a wider reaching power might do. The above power lets you figure out important truths and obtain the necessary tools to do something about said truths, which when coupled with very nearly as much power as the Random Omnipotent Being was willing to give away, seems like one of the best offers to make.)

  What is the optimal way to use the time travel ability of the boardgame Jumanji? From the first film we know that time can be reversed at least 26 years, Sarah would have a second high-school graduation and college graduation, she would likely remember the exxon Valdez tanker spilling oil into the ocean and the union carbide gas leak in India. It is insane not to play Jumanji again and again to save lives (prevent 9/11?) but obviously it's dangerous because Jumanji. How long would Sarah have to train with Alan to start another Jumanji timeline to save lives? 

  Also is Jumanji actually dangerous? Is it possible to lose?  Does the game ever permanently kill anyone (besides those alternate timeline children who possibly have their existence erraced)? Is it ethical to not play Jumanji? What actually happens if you lose?
  ```

  - u/scruiser:
    ```
    Is the exact rule for the time travel even clear?  Is the game cleaning itself up back to initial starting condition (so players "playing" for a super long time get to start back at the time the originally started when winning) or is it merely cleaning up negative consequences (being stuck in the game was a negative consequence that happened 26 years ago)?  

    If it is the first case, exploiting the time travel is relatively easy:  First player takes their turn by themselves, set the game aside, and then wait years for other players to join in.  Only the First player will be reset... although you could push this up to 2 or 3 players... 4 players is unreliable because the game might find a way to pressure them into continuing so they can't just delay their turns, it is safest to not even have everyone playing.  Hmm... each additional turn is a risk, probably best to have the first player go, see if the card they drew is safely manageable, and then have the 2nd/3rd players go if the card effect is too dangerous and they need to delay on an easier card.  Then wait for years, recording and memorizing major historical events you wish to alter/exploit, then finish the game.

    For the second case, it is much trickier... you need a card with negative and long term consequences.  Play the game until a long term negative comes up, then stop playing until enough years have passed.  This is tough because it means the players might be stuck with extremely adverse conditions (being stuck in a Jungle) while they wait.

    If it is the combination of these conditions (incomplete number of players and negative effects that need undoing), exploiting the time travel might be hard as you need to get a long term negative effect within the first 3 turns.

    Also, if we are counting the Videogame Jumanji as canon, then that means that the children will regain their memories of the alt-timeline once it catches up to when they originally  use it.  So that means your players that joined later also get their alt-timeline memories which is good.

    However the Videogame Jumanji and Zarathustra movies heavily imply the game is semi-sentient.  Thus exploiting it for time travel might annoy it and cause it to give you worse cards... or it might demand harder win conditions in return for the time travel benefit you are getting... or the game might entirely rewrite itself to suit you, in the case of a group working to exploit its time travel properties, it might give you a time travel theme gamed, or a game about munchkining weird and complicated magical conditions, or something else entirely (SCP board game?).  The game seems to be "fair" in some sense, so it will probably give you benefits/rewards in compensation for the danger and it will probably be winnable in some sense, but if it scales difficulty it might get really dangerous and hard (unprepared kids looking for fun get an easier difficulty than prepared young adults looking to bend a whimsical magical item to their benefit).

      > So that means your players that joined later also get their alt-timeline memories which is good.

      Though it also seems to work by overwriting the alternate versions, which is less good.

      In the ideal case, they'd have memories of both lives, which is pretty much the only non horrific way to do it, but there's no indication that this happened. However, they interacted with the run down house so rarely in their original timelines, that it's possible his return didn't butterfly their lives out of control so they didn't realize they remembered both versions.
      ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    My understanding of Jumanji is that it isn't actually dangerous if you are well prepared and not a bunch of civilian kids. Jumanji simply releases a bunch of dangerous jungle threats, and humanity has conquered the jungle long long ago. Just prepare lots of modern military equipment and protective suits and fill the place with insecticide. 

    So insects will drop dead, poisons won't work, animals will be shot dead, and the hunter's antique gun will be outmatched by heavy firepower. Really the most dangerous part of the game is the dimensional travel, but you can probably smuggle guns and supplies across and survive for the at most a few hours that it takes the other players to release you.

    In fact, the dimensional travel may even present an opportunity. That jungle probably isn't on Earth at all, which means, all the resources we extract out of the wilderness? Probably still in that jungle, untouched! Who knows what precious materials could be found and brought back? There could literally be gold veins in there!

  You have the ability to telepathically say something to every human being on the planet. Only you have the ability, nobody else does. You can only say things, you cannot pick up on other people's thoughts. What you say always comes out in a monotone, almost un-emotive voice (think dry news hosts), and will be translated for people who speak different languages. And finally, your message is heard by everyone, from every toddler to elders on deathbed. How do you abuse this power?

    Pretend to be the voice of god and tell people to repent for their evil ways?

    Actually rather than god, it might be better to pretend to be a powerful alien race. One that has discovered humanity and their evil evil ways, and is giving humanity a chance to fix it or be destroyed.

  So this one is more of a puzzle. Lets say there are two near omnipotent sides to a conflict that play to specific rules (practical guide to evil style). Except it's sci-fi and they are aliens and the world is a cross between cyberpunk and Overwatch.

  The "Good" side likes to reward protecting people, healing people, restoring (or creating) environmental diversity and stability, as well as protecting, creating, and restoring population centers and cultures (especially both at once).

  The "Evil" side likes to reward killing people (specifically, and especially, those who work for the "good" side), dominating populations, destroying (often more of a converting/corrupting) environments and infrastructure (specifically those supporting the "good" side), and corrupting/suppressing cultures.

  People are uplifted by these sides when they act along these lines in notable ways.

  So here is the question. How would one become uplifted by both sides at effectively the same moment? This requires one to be considered a possible candidate by both sides, and to then do a single action worthy of uplift by both sides.

  As an example, destroying a significant amount of "good" infrastructure (evil side) to protect people (good side; people the destroyer cares about, but that the "good" person setting up the infrastructure didn't).

  (An alternative question might be. How would one (slightly) modify the above systems to allow for this? Though this is more world building, I thought I would include it in case anyone has great ideas.)
  ```

  - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
    ```
    It could work if one side is intention-based while the other is consequence-based. So someone could try to commit great evil but end up causing great good, or the other way around, and get rewarded by both sides.

      Ohhh thank you! I like this response better than what I was trying to do, it solves the problem on a more meta level too. Them having different philosophies on how judgment is done works nicely with what I was intending. They already had different philosophies, I just wasn't applying it to their judgement because I wrote the mechanics separately and because I want them to be balanced mirrors of each other. But for some specific things like this, well it really works! Thanks again.

    A city of people who were loyal to the 'good' side have been enslaved and are about to launch a grueling offensive campaign that will slaughter countless lives.

    While others are locked in a bureaucratic gridlock, our individual gives the authorization to nuke the city into oblivion, despite most of his own family being there.

    The good side grant uplift for averting a war that would have devastated an entire region, for making the hard choice that ultimately protects the world the most. The evil side love that fact that he just killed a ridiculous number of people, more than any other individual in a single day prior to this moment.

    What do you think?

    edit: Essentially. Utilitarian Moralism allows one to commit atrocious acts of evil whilst still technically categorizing them under 'greatest good' results. If one side uplifts for the 'Means' and the other for the 'Ends' in "the ends justify the means", then there are numerous situations that can trigger a dual uplift.
    ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    This might be too specific to the examples here rather than the overall goal, but creating life in otherwise barren areas/planets that is aligned with "evil" both creates diversity and increases the number of corrupted entities.

    The specific measurements of harm and healing may be exploitable. If you stab someone with a incurable poison, is the harm a continually rising "value" or based on the initial action? Because you could continuously heal them afterwards and there may be some mismatch there you can benefit from.

    Killing someone to protect another meets both criteria. If alignment of the individuals killed matters, there's enough ways to temporarily alter someone's mental state that they could act uncharacteristic enough to not be, in the moment, counted as their alignment (probably removing someone's good alignment more so than evil alignment, because inhibitions and stuff). It'd depend on methods of measurement.

    Edit: Oh if intent is a factor, then responding with either or good or evil aligned action to any accidents would be a gain for that said, so if you partner up with someone of another alignment and have a third person cause accidents repeatedly through some method (does Russian Roulette's randomness qualify as an accident or do I have to get more creative?) then you could farm uplift.

    Also do dead people contribute uplift? Because I'm sure a dead person could set up a continually active/worsening scenario that the opposite alignment could farm for uplift (or just a chaotic scenario that could create things classified as accidents instead).
    ```
