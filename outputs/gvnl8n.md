  Also, might as well post this here for those that missed it; a few months back I was commissioned to write a short story set in the universe of a new superhero comic series called Incident Report. The basic premise is pretty straightforward: a substantial minority of people started developing powers in the not too distant past, and in the modern day the government tries to keep track of everyone who develops powers, called Chimerans.  

  My story is unconnected from the main plot of the comics, and is just a "what if" scenario I thought would be neat. Hope you enjoy it!

  It's rare that I get short story inspiration, and even rarer that I end up publishing them, but the idea for this popped into my head a few days ago and wouldn't go away until I dashed it out. Just did an editing pass and it actually feels sufficient, so enjoy!

    This was really good, thank you! Maybe make your short story publications less rare? ðŸ™‚

  If I'm understanding the ending, the wizard turned himself into a chicken because a prophesy told him to?

    ```
    Yep.
    ```

      Heh. Now I'm pondering if the two actions are from within the same prophecy, or if the wizard is frantically running around like a chicken to deal with multiple prophecies instead?

        Exactly :)

  I'm reminded of something thought when reading a scene in the Recluce series--"I saw myself acting more brutally, and I didn't, and now people are dead who didn't have to die"--*who's steering?*  Who's deciding desirable outcomes and dictating to you what to do to get them?  More to the point, how can you get to the position of being the one to choose the outcomes and know why your choices are having those effects, rather than being yanked around by someone else's priorities?

  (Mental image:  "...and as it turns out, that one moment was the crucial tipping point to set in motion a chain of events that would end in the complete genocide of the green-skinned peoples.  The ancient wizards HATED the green-skin peoples, mainly because they believed red was the most holy colour and thought back then that green was the opposite of red.")  


  <wondering whether the chicken part was a mistranslation, or helping modulate the other's behaviour more through added surrealism, or whether the person speaking was in the first place a magical talking giant chicken who only turned himself into a human the man would recognise because of prophecy...>

    I might really enjoy a story about prophecies where there's like, five different competing deities that each keep sending their own to people to get them to do different (ultimately not often great) things. People wouldn't even know they're not from the same source, but the meme of "Omg a prophecy we have to listen to it" is itself just such a bizarre thing to have in any world that takes itself seriously.

      For prophecies, as with contracts, the 'or' is nice.  'I will do such-and-such OR be fined by the government for two thirds of my net wealth at time of signing, to be paid to the other signatories.'  'I will not betray my spouse in sickness or in health, OR my own pre-nuptial contract defenses will be invalidated.'  'Quit it with the slavery, OR all your innocent children will mysteriously die.'  'Repair the dam, OR after about two or three more floods it's going to break and kill everyone nearby with floods.' After enough prophecies--ideally delivered with aspects which are hard to fake--which provide meaningful things, the idea of enforcing them becomes more compelling...  at least (for the case of punishments) until humans could reach up and drag the punisher down from their throne.  


      Something I've enjoyed in a few different fictions is 'Yes, we found you because of a prophecy, and the prophecy also prophesies our eventual triumph over the other side, but the other side also has its OWN prophesies.'.  One that I can't remember the name of at the moment more or less played it straight, and fairly shallowly; The Redemption of Althalus I remember had a scene of {Side B making a prophesy of Side A's member being laid low (as a princess in her own palace?) by Side B's member} which was dealt with by going along with it and being obediently laid low before, prophesy having been satisfied, having lots of long-prepared secret forces jump out and easily overcome the Side B members who had just been doing the laying-low of Side A members.

  Did a prophecy tell you to write this? :b
