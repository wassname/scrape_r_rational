## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Does anyone here run alt accounts? I have a few, and three rules for them:

  1. **Don't lie about your credentials**, where "credentials" are interpreted broadly to mean life experiences (e.g. don't claim that you have a degree that you don't, don't say you lived someplace you haven't, don't say you met someone when you didn't). You shouldn't be doing any of this anyway, but it's one of the shitty things that people do with alts sometimes.
  2. **Don't create false popularity** by commenting on your own stuff, upvoting your own comments/submissions (against site rules here and some other places, and checked for via automation), or backing yourself up in an argument. I kind of feel like people shouldn't be swayed by two people making an identical argument, but they are.
  3. **Don't say anything that you couldn't handle being linked back to you**. Partly this is just prudence, rather than a matter of ethics, but I think the ethical part comes in from people saying things that they don't actually believe or stand behind, which you shouldn't be doing, and which alts might potentially enable.

  For myself, I find alt accounts useful because there's baggage attached to this handle, and while most of it is *good* baggage, it's still something that some people will bring into a conversation, or that *I'll* bring into a conversation.

    > I kind of feel like people shouldn't be swayed by two people making an identical argument, but they are.

    This is a thing where I'm really not satisfied by my brain's algorithm.

    Actually, it's even worse than that. If I hear someone make a convincing argument, I'll be somewhat convinced. If I later hear (or see or read) the same person make the same argument to a different audience, I'll retroactively find their argument less convincing because they've used it twice.

    I think what happens is that, on the second "exposure", my brain internalizes "Hey, this isn't actually spontaneous and from-the-heart stuff, this person actually spent *effort* making this argument sound good", which makes its convincing-ness seem more artificial.

    And, overall, that makes sense, but it just highlights that I was naive to take the convincing argument at face value the first time around. (sort of, I don't actually think I'm naive, don't make me caveat this sentence to death)

    > For myself, I find alt accounts useful because there's baggage attached to this handle, and while most of it is good baggage, it's still something that some people will bring into a conversation, or that I'll bring into a conversation.

    Yeah. I'm commenting a lot on Worm right now, and I don't know if I'd do it as much if every time I posted something I thought people might compare it to something I had written.

      You can try to become more cynical. Look down on others as silly irrational agents. Then you become like me: whenever I hear something, I think "that's stupid" before I even parse it. I then attempt to prove that it *is* stupid, to prove to myself that I'm smarter than everyone else.

    You're enthusiasm about a topic, which I would never have expected here, is super-refreshing!

    I tried muay thai for a year some time ago, but in general I know very little about mma competitions. Could you tell more, what’s the deal with weight cutting, why is it moloch?

    I just did some quick googling, is the extreme dehydration before weigh-in the problem? Could one design a different system, which does not reward cutting weight by dehydration, maybe measuring and correcting for total body water with bioelectrical impedance analysis or isotope dilution, so one could use hydration-level-corrected weight classes?

    How was the event itself, did you enjoy it?

    - u/MagicWeasel:

      > what’s the deal with weight cutting, why is it moloch

      Biggest driver: in combat sports, being heavier is better (to a point: heavyweight has a limit of 265lb but most tend to weigh around 240lb). 

      So if you are fighting people who are 175lb, it's better for you to "walk around" at say 185lb and somehow lose 10lb of water weight really quick just before the fight, and then regain that water weight before you fight, so you can have an extra 10lb of muscle. 

      This becomes the dominant strategy, so (virtually) all the fighters who are fighting at 175lb "really" weigh say 185lb or 190lb - so you're not actually getting an advantage by cutting from 185 to 175, you're just avoiding being lighter than all your opponents. 

      It gets worse because the weight cutting is dangerous, especially if not done properly. If you don't rehydrate well enough it can make you more prone to serious injury - something to do with hydrating the fluid that cushions the brain (of all the deaths in boxing, which also has weight cutting, none have happened at heavyweight, where weight cutting is not required). 

      So you have a bunch of professional athletes engaging in a long, expensive, painful process (you have to eat a certain diet, run on a treadmill in a hoodie, alternate between saunas and ice baths; they used to rehydrate with an *IV*, but that's been banned, though apparently everyone still does it because how will the UFC know and you can order IVs to your hotel room in vegas because it's good for hangovers apparently?), just so that way they can shrink to a lower weight so they won't be smaller than the guys who do that.

      -----

      >Could one design a different system, which does not reward cutting weight by dehydration, maybe measuring and correcting for total body water with bioelectrical impedance analysis or isotope dilution, so one could use hydration-level-corrected weight classes?

      Isotope dilution takes a long time and requires that the athlete not eat or drink anything during the measurement so probably not a good idea. Bioelectrical impedance is not super accurate - it's OK for your scales at home but not for this sort of thing. You'd want to use a bodpod type device that would get accurate density. But really they do urine dehydration tests to measure these sorts of things. 

      The best way to ban weight cutting would be by doing what [ONE FC](https://onefc.com/martial_arts/) does: 

      - Athletes must submit their current walking weight and daily training weight regularly. Athletes will input and track their daily weight online via a dedicated web portal.
      - Athletes will be assigned to their weight class based on collated data and random weight checks. Athletes are not allowed to drop a weight class less than eight weeks out from an event.
      - During fight week, weights are checked daily. Urine specific gravity will also be checked the day after arrival and three hours prior to the event.  Athletes must be within their weight class and pass specific gravity hydration tests all week and up to three hours before the event.  If an athlete falls outside the weight, or fails a test, they are disqualified from the event.  Doctors may request additional testing at their discretion.
      - Catchweight bouts are allowed. However, the athlete with the higher weight will not be heavier than 105% of the lighter opponent’s weight.
      - ONE will conduct random weight checks on athletes at its discretion.
      - Athletes may petition to change weight classes outside of the eight-week competition zone and must be within their new desired weight at that time. In addition, athletes must pass a specific gravity urine test when their weight is within the limits of the newly petitioned weight class. ONE doctors can request additional testing to determine the amount of weight drop allowed over a specific time.
      - The usage of IVs for the purpose of rehydration will not be allowed.

      > How was the event itself, did you enjoy it?

      Objectively the event wasn't "one for the ages" - it never really was going to be, the card kind of sucked - but it was so much fun / surreal to be *in the arena* as the fights were happening and to see everything. I was surprised that the commentary wasn't piped through - I don't know why but I assumed it would be? - and it was amazing at the first prelim fight how nuts the crowd went when Bruce Buffer started talking (with the early prelim fighters getting only a perfunctory clap). 

      I had trouble buying tickets when they went on sale (I was on the "mailing list" so I got an early code and I couldn't get on a purchase page) so I ended up paying twice as much for tickets as I'd originally planned but I'm kind of glad I did as our seats were decent (not good - that would have been another 50% but who's counting). Then probably about 5% of seats in our little section were not filled which shocked me because apparently the event sold out.

      A lot of the Aussies won so that was great. I still wish Bobby Knuckles (Robert Whittaker) could've fought - he pulled out about six weeks ago - but you can't have everything.

      And the energy of the crowd was second to none. My favourite thing about watching MMA is the crowds - we go to the sports bar at our city's casino to watch it and just having other people there to go "Oooooh!" and clap and stuff makes such a difference over watching something at home with just two people. So having like 8,000 people was insane. When the event finished seeing the thousands of people walking along the city's footpaths was unbelievable. 

      I hope it comes back but it'll be another 2-3 years.

  Weekly update on the [hopefully rational](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11QAh61C8gsL-5KbdIy5zx3IN6bv_E9UkHjwMLVQ7LHg/edit?usp=sharing) roguelike [immersive sim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbyTOAlhRHk) Pokemon Renegade, as well as the associated engine and tools. [Handy discussion links and previous threads here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EUSMDHdRdbvQJii5uoSezbjtvJpxdF6Da8zqvuW42bg/edit?usp=sharing).

  ----

  [This past week made some decent progress on the Types tab](https://ketura.github.io/bills-pc-2/index.html).  Originally I had thought that it would be best for it to just be a table with the various types in it ([such as the one in the current draft of the type interactions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RerFWXp3NNGZjFcUBTl2u94z-8Sr-SZ0_utpYfNIlZ8/edit#gid=140263346)), and you would modify the data in the cells directly.  But then I remembered that Affinities are a thing that exist.  And then I remembered that defensive subtypes will need a place, and stat modifiers, and type-based abilities, and, and….so I’ve moved away from the grid as the centerpiece.

  Instead (as you can kinda see in the link above), I’ve gone back more or less [to the design that existed in the first version of Bill’s PC](https://i.imgur.com/F7DEmHp.png), by putting type generation and customization in its own section.  I’m keeping the grid tho, even if it’s read-only at the bottom.  

  Add a type simply by typing its name in the box and hitting space or enter, select a type by clicking on it, sort the list as needed using the arrow keys, delete it by using the Delete button, and rename it using the “Change Name” box.  Github has this thing where it likes to 404 my css, so apologies for the scattered look of the layout at the moment.  And before you ask why there’s both a delete button and x’s on the individual tags, well, the css hides the x’s, as it’s too easy to accidentally delete a tag when you meant to select it, so I had to provide a less error-prone option.

  Next goal is to hook up the Notes text box and Offensive/Defensive profile buttons to save their info into the type, get that saving into the local storage, and then work on letting you actually modify the damage multipliers.  I might just end up using the table instead of making it read only, but if I can’t get it to play nice I’ll just generate a separate row (above the “add subtypes” box) and leave the table read-only.  After that, it’s attaching affinities, abilities, and stats to individual types and/or subtypes, which doesn’t have a gui designed yet so I’ll have to wing it.

  After that, I’m probably going to hook up the Console tab so that reasonable log output can be shown to the user, which is going to require me to find a decent logging library and rework my current code to use it, as well as set up the Settings and Help tabs so they’re at least ready to have things added to them as needed.  Then Stats (since it will have to be in place for stats on types to mean anything), and then I’ll move on to tackling the behemoth that is the Species tab.  Seriously, that one’s monstrous; for all the work I’ve put in the Types tab (for the second time), the Species tab dwarfs it pretty hard.

  ----

  Lots of design discussion this week, mostly around Types (naturally), but also explaining high-level concepts to newcomers, which I always enjoy doing.  Lets me dust out the ol’ noggin and make sure everything’s still remembered.

  One thing that came up once again is the concept of multi-host evolution, which is to say things like Diglett -> Dugtrio.  Personally I like the idea that you physically need three separate Diglett all trained up (or not) before you can have a full Dugtrio.  There are other examples of this, including Magneton, Slowbro, and supposedly Mantine and Shelmet/Karrablast, tho those last ones seem a bit out there to me.  

  The requirement for multiple species to work with this system is particularly niggly, especially in cases where you might encounter them as opponents on an enemy trainer’s team.  Whatever solution we come up with would need to be manually induced but at the same time not able to delay evolution indefinitely; a pokemon’s EVs are at least partially ‘baked in’ to its evolved form’s base stats upon evolution, and EXP and everstones have been altered to ensure that no pokemon can be delayed indefinitely to produce an arbitrarily powerful evolution.  So too we can’t permit for Superdiglett to become Superdugtrio.

  For Dugtrio and Magneton, I think we’ve found a decent solution.  We’ll say that Magnemite evolves just like any other pokemon--once it hits a threshold of EXP and EVs, it enters a metamorphosis stage lasting a variable amount of time, which climaxes with the white glowy bit that we all know and love.  However, the freshly-minted Magneton numbers is quite singular, and begins to seek out other Magneton to perform a one-time bonding with almost immediately.

  Mechanically, we’ll say that like a third of the new Magneton’s EVs, rather than going into base stats will go into a temporary bonding resource that can be used to initiate a bonding with other single Magneton.  This bonding resource will deplete over time, until a sad point when the Magneton is cursed to be solo for the rest of its days.  If a freshly-evolved Magneton were to find others of its ilk nearby, also freshly-evolved, then with a high bonding resource available, they might be able to form a group of four--or five.  But most often it takes time to find other suitable mates, with only enough bonding resource to accommodate three individuals, and in some sad cases only one other individual can be mated with for life.

  This permits us to have our cake and eat it too, in a number of ways.  I rather quite like it, but it doesn’t translate perfectly to the inter-species examples: we can’t wait for Shellder to evolve to Cloyster before it can bond with a Slowbro (or I suppose we could, but the change in size and shape might be a big much; it was already a bit of a stretch), since besides the logistics the whole *point* is that shellder and slowpoke induce the evolution together. 

  I’m not sure how to solve this just yet, but I’m sure we’ll get it.  Thoughts and comments are of course welcome on the matter.

    Looking at the current type interactions, you've given certain types multiple types of body part that they cover, which is actually really interesting. But do you plan on doing the same for offence? As an example, flying moves in the games cover both attacks via bird-like body parts (eg peck), but also attacks via wind (eg gust). 

    Maybe these are just spread out over different types, like peck being a normal move or something, but then there is also an argument for, as an example, cutting/piercing/blunt damage. How is offence handled?
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Offensively, there's a lot more going on that allows us to customize how damage is dealt, that doesn't really give a need for alternate offensive sub-types like we have for defense.  For instance, physical attacks don't have to scale entirely off of ATK and be defended entirely by DEF, while the same holds true for special attacks and SPATK/SPDEF.  If I use Tackle, it might scale 20% off of ATK, 40% off of Weight, and 40% off of how fast the pokemon is moving when the hit landed.  Headbutt might scale 20% off of ATK and 80% off of DEF.  Fine-tuning like this lets us represent how damage is being applied in a much more granular fashion than typing's general bonus/resistance.  

      However, coding the same sort of thing for "this is all the ways this particular attack can be defended" is far more tedious, which is why we started doing multiple defensive sub-types to help encode certain archetypes.

      Generally in canon, types encode a lot more than just damage.  For instance, Fighting is less effective against Flying (presumably) because of Flying's ability to dodge and weave through the air.  We already have dodging through space, so any evasionary aspect of types needs to be completely stripped out.  Likewise, we've tried to remove any thematic influences, such as Flying doing extra damage against Bug--one might argue that beaks etc can rip through chitin, but if that's the case wouldn't it be *even more* effective against unprotected Normal flesh?  In this case it's pretty clear that it was a purely thematic choice: Birds eat Bugs, so Flying 2x Bug.  

      (This particular case is especially clear due to the fact that Red and Green originally had a Bird type that was consolidated into Flying late in development; references to it still exist in the game's code.)

      Offensive moves can also have their typed damage divided any way the designer wants, in increments of 1%.  Thunder Punch thus would hit for something like 40% Electric and 60% Normal, and have weakness/resistance prorated accordingly.  Now, many canon moves, as you've pointed out, are prime candidates for reducing to Normal-type damage since they don't do anything *inherently* different.  A beak hitting flesh or chitin or solid steel or a fish is going to have its damage defined by how sharp the beak is and how soft the target is, which is what ATK and DEF are for.  Thus, I think Peck deals all Normal damage.  The Gust family of moves are really the prime example of Flying moves, which for the most part I've interpreted as a Wind type, offensively.  Maybe Gust does 95% Flying 5% Normal just for a token effort to simulate debris, and maybe Whirlwind or Hurricane are closer to 70/30.  

      For a while I waffled on the existence of piercing/cutting/bludgeoning damage but opted not to encode it with a type or mechanic.  If there are examples of moves that particularly rely on piercing etc damage, then we can by design convention simply include those considerations into the move damage calculation.  Maybe Slash scales normally off of ATK and is defended normally by DEF, except that for every 5 points of ATK you have, you ignore a point of DEF (or something).  If enough of these patterns emerge to be used in enough places, I'll probably consider a keyword-based addition system to moves, so it would be like a TCG where you would see the word **Piercing** in the move description and know that it cuts through DEF as described above.  

      (if it wasn't clear, each move is going to be an individual script file, structured in a way to make bog standard moves trivial and more in-depth moves straightforward enough to produce.)

  I am writing a story about exploring a maze, but I've ran into a problem. How do I describe a maze in a story?

  I could ignore keep track of a path and just focus on landmarks and interesting features the protagonist notices on the paths that he slowly learns to specifically navigate to. I could include pictures of the maze that he has explored so far, but that entails a birds-eye view which would give the reader more information than he has access to (which I don't want).

  Does anyone have good ideas about writing the exploration of a suburban maze or know about stories that does a good job talking about how to explore a maze?

  Edit: Are there any books on dealing with real-life mazes? Like if you go to corn mazes to solve them as if it was your job rather than just for fun?
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    It's been a while since I've read it, but *House of Leaves* has a section like that. It's more about the feeling of exploring a maze, rather than giving the reader a sense of what the layout of the maze is -- it seems really hard to use prose to convey visual information like that.

    If you wanted images, you could do them with a "fog of war" style, but that still might give the reader more perfect information than you want.

    Highlight landmarks and pitfalls (including dead ends near good paths), have wildly inconsistent scaling, and leave large areas blank.

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I guess that's doable, but what I'm asking is for suggestions on writing prose related to mazes. The images should support the writing, not using the writing to support the images. I'm not that good of a drawer to get away with mainly using images.

      Good catch though. I got stuck on the idea of using overhead drawings rather than a ground-level sketch.
      ```

  - u/Kishoto:
    ```
    Landmarks, interesting Landmarks, are definitely the way to go. You can have sections where the protagonist keeps looping back to the same heckling magic statue of a jester, only to later reveal that the maze layout changed based on that interaction. You can have the protagonist feel as if he's on the right path, exulting his success in his head, only to come back to the same gnarled oak from the previous chapter. Before he sinks into despair, he notices that this gnarled oak is actually not the same one and was there to bait him into taking a wrong turn. You can have skeletons that respawn and attack him and the protagonist initially navigates the maze such that he stays away from them only to realize he's going in circles and that the maze creators intent is for him to follow where the skeletons are spawning heaviest to exit.

    There are...a. Lot of things you can do that don't necessarily require giving the reader an accurate map. Though, if you're confident in your maze drawing abilities, drawing one for yourself could help the writing process
