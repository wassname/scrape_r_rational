## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday General Rationality)

  I've been wondering how to write a romance story in a way that's compelling to this subreddit, and I feel one solution is to involve a magical system that directly relates to romance. It allows for some interesting munchkining without focusing only on relationship drama which would bore people here fast if that's all there is to the story.

  So I've been playing around with the tropes of soulmarks by deconstructing them and showing how a society with soulmarks would play out if soulmarks are actually a thing.

  The part I've been thinking about is *what does a soulmark actually entail?*

  It's not a clear answer if you think it means a romantic relationship between two people. Because there are people who don't care about romance (aromantics), everyone has very different opinions on what romance means, there are people who think romance isn't limited to one other person (polyamory), and even more issues with the murky meaning of romance.

  After a while it gets fairly complicated and requires an intelligent mind to set up all of the soulmarks. I want to make it more like a law of nature with very simple rules but with very complicated behavior.

  So is there a simpler metric that the soulmark can measure which people then (mistakenly) think actually means a guaranteed romantic relationship?

  I'm tentatively considering soulmarks to be an indicator of someone who would have the most growth of happiness over the course of combined lifespans.

  Systems for measuring emotions would help too.

    I mean, depending on how hard your magic system is going to be, and how dark your world is, there are a number of options. I'll list a few.

    1) The Soulmark measures relationship strength in a memetic manner. One option is to have it based off of a memeplex - it finds how strong each person in the world would find a given relationship if they knew all the details, and assigns it a value based of the average of this value, or the median, or whatever. This accommodates for changes in the perception of romance over time, and the formation of new types of acceptable relationships.

    2) The soulmark is still measuring based of perceptions, but instead it only does so on the perceptions of those who know about the relationship. How they perceive it depends on its strength - so an abusive relationship carried out by a charismatic abuser could be quite strong. Revealing the flaws in a relationship to the wider populace could cause the power to weaken. Again, strength can be based on average, total, or median romantic level perceived.

    3) The Soulmark is precognitive, and measures future levels of romanticness (by another method) to determine strength. A 'true' couple which will last for a long time will gain a larger amount, perhaps. Of course, this is still open to abuse.

    4) The soulmark measures romance levels based on hormone levels, either at the time or on average. Depending on the hormones used, 'battle couples' could appear, who take drugs during battle to amplify romantic strength while tricking the mark. The mark can have varying levels of intelligence and knowledge of these tactics as needed - it may even want to see people abuse the concept if you go for a concept like a big bad who wants to prove relationships mean nothing.

    5) The Soulmark measures something different for each person based on them personally. Perhaps it is doing this to manipulate them, for good or ill, or maybe it just thinks it's helping. One person may grow stronger depending on perception, another based on happy hormones, another based off physical closeness, etc. But this only works with the chosen partner/s.

    6) The relationship is actually the other way around - the Soulmark gains power naturally based on some possibly unrelated unknown criteria, and as it does so forces the target to get deeper into romantic relationships for whatever reason, manipulating them in subtle or overt ways. Maybe at high levels of power, individuals start to develop extremely unhealthy tendencies to maintain their relationship, such as induced nymphomania, stalking, a need for closeness, and so on. This could be good for a darker setting.

    7) The Soulmarks are sapient, and want to learn. They reward their hosts for teaching them more about romance, delving deeper into the host's mind as time goes on to find out their thoughts. They reward the host for finding out more about their relationship, it getting stronger and such. Introspection and time with their partner are great ways of doing this.

    8) The Soulmarks are sapient, and judges. Maybe sent by the Gods, maybe implants from birth, but they judge based off their own criteria and award or punish based off that. Maybe one thinks gifts mean love, and punish their financially unstable host for not giving lavish gifts to his humble girlfriend, whose host instead values physical contact to an uncomfortable level. Could get very bright or dark with this.

    9) The Soulmark has strict, well-defined breaking points for more power, completely missing the subtleties of a healthy relationship. Maybe it gives a boost for finding love of a certain type, then first kiss, then sex, etc. Either way, people use and abuse these rules for easy boosts in power - though certain stages require complicated rituals that would normally require a romantically involved or trusting partner, or perhaps huge amounts of wealth or pain tolerance. These can be relatively innocent, or get darker as stages are pushed through.

    That's all I have for now - hope it helped!

      This one is really interesting and I like the idea of a passenger (ala Worm) where it's a mind with a completely alien perspective with no understanding of romance, but gives rewards based on what it thinks it understands. I'm thinking of how if the mind is somewhat ant-like, then it would consider a relationship heavily connected to the community at large more sensible than a more private one. But of course there are couples who are only concerned with appearances over actual emotional connections which is counter to an actually healthy relationship.

      I think this is the one that I might actually go with. I was thinking of psychological measurements and researching subjective systems for measuring emotions. But having the mark measure hormones, or more specifically the amount of oxytocin (also known as the "love chemical"), and setting the world in an era without much modern knowledge of the body works very nicely for my purposes. Thanks!

    > a magical system that directly relates to romance

    This scared me until I read the rest of your post, because my first thought on reading that was "guy can cast spells and (gives himself a harem)/(makes the most attractive woman in the world fall in love with him)" and if you want to read *that* sort of story www.mcstories.com (NSFW) will have plenty. 

    But yeah.... this should go without saying but make sure any romance magic doesn't go in the "getting people to fall in love" category but more in the "providing information to make good decisions" category.

    The soulmarks are going to be, essentially, tattoos that people are born with that match their soulmate's? My first thought is there's a system similar to astrology but That Actually Works, so depending on your "sign", you'll have one of several different soulmarks - there could be hundreds. Astrologers would read the soulmarks - maybe there's a diamond soulmark and a square soulmark and you need yours interpreted to find out what it is. Maybe the part of the body it appears on matters. 

    "under the hood" it could depend on something like... hormone levels (maybe they appear at puberty so the personality is "locked in"?)

    Anyway, there'd be a whole dating system that lines should date other lines or squares but under no circumstances should a blob date another blob because they're just not compatible. It's not perfect (some of the relationships fail/etc) but people still believe in it because it's the culture, and ultimately the line-soulmark does end up married to a square-soulmark just a different one than had the really unsuccessful relationship with.... SO THE SYSTEM WORKS?

    Probably too cynical and not magical enough for what you were after though!

    first, soulmarks can change over time, as people change. 

    next, not all information is understood, and not all information is observed. some information requires specific tools (or rituals) to view, with different levels that get more difficult to view. this adds uncertainty, but allows money to solve most of the problem. you can also have experts argue over some specific details. 

    third, soulmarks should say very broad and general things on the top level- orientation, identity, if you like risk. on a deeper level, you see more specific details, preferences, and dislikes. 

    as a result, top-level data (the most easily observed, and the best understood) ends up being used in court cases (like dna is used today). this may include scars from trauma (ptsd), or age spots (alzheimers, dementia). personality type. 

    second-level data will have multiple approaches for fortune-telling, matchmaking, and medical diagnosis. psychiatry may use it heavily, as most mental illness would be at this level. some lunatics say they can change your soulmark, but those are mostly quacks who hurt people. 

    for plot, i would go with a man who uses a different matchmaking method than the woman he ends up with (and leaving it unclear if its the best possible match, just that its a good match).

  I'm beginning the process of sending my short story off to literary magazines. Does anyone have any tips? This is the first time I've done this.

    get a friend to look over it first. someone else will be able to see problems you cant. 

    in general, take the time to fix as many technical problems as you can- spelling, punctuation, grammar. 

    past that, it may depend on the genre of your writing. do pay attention to the length that different publications may want.
