## [BST] Writing a fanfiction involving Trafalgar Law from One Piece, and I need help understanding just how capable his Devil Fruit abilities are.

### Post:

I'm trying to figure out if Law is as stupidly powerful as I think he is, or if I'm overestimating him.  I'm writing a fanfiction featuring him, but it'd be really boring if an intelligent Law could just sweep any opponent he meets using his powers.  So I have to find out if he's as overpowered as I think he is, and whether or not I would have to weaken him, take away certain abilities, or maybe just strengthen and wisen up his opponents.

For those who don't know about Trafalgar Law, he's a character from One Piece.  He's known as the "Surgeon of Death", a pirate captain who has the Op-Op Fruit, or Ope Ope no mi, which has turned him into a "Free Modification Human".  I've collected his abilities below for those who don't know enough about him or his powers.  Warning though, there are heavy spoilers.

Non-Devil Fruit Abilities-

* Very strong physically.  It's hard to say how strong exactly, considering he rarely uses this strength directly, but he definitely run fast and hit hard, although this isn't his specialty.

* Trained at least somewhat in swordsmanship.  He regularly waves around a nodachi with one hand.

* Great stamina and recovery time.  Ignoring the fact that Law can also operate on himself, he is shown as being able to recover from beatings  that would kill a normal human, and then heal quickly and go into another battle.

* Intelligent.  Very much so.  Or at least in plotting.  If he didn't let his emotions control him, he could have killed his greatest enemy simply by chucking a scientist into the water until the man drowned.  Which shows a weakness in his intelligence, in that he lets his emotions cloud what would be much more rational moves.

* Very skilled in terms of medical expertise, having gotten trained by one of the most noted doctors in his world (his father), at one of the best medical academies in that world.  He often uses this in conjunction with his devil fruit abilities.

* Haki.  For those who don't know, haki is an ability that, among other things, allows characters to attack other characters who have "intangibility powers", such intangibility powers being able to turn into smoke or fire, or otherwise.  It also serves as a highly affective armor, and to vastly increase the strength of physical attacks.  It can do other things too, but Law has only been confirmed to be able to use this offensive form of haki, known as "armament haki"

Devil Fruit Abilities (Ope Ope no mi)- 

• Able to create a "room", which is a sphere in which everything inside is his "operating table".  Almost all of his devil fruit abilities are performed within this room, and can only be performed within a room.  The range on this room can be large enough to even encompass mountains, but if it is too large or maintained for too long, it drains Law's stamina away, and then his life force.  Also, once the opponent is outside Law's room, they are safe from his abilities.

• Also limited by Law having to make hand gestures and pay attention to what he's doing.  Enemies can take advantage of this reaction time to strike.

• Weakened by sea water.  Seriously.  If he is submerged to any moderate degree in sea or ocean water, he is unable to use his powers, and becomes incredibly weak.  He also cannot swim.  Residual soaking by water doesn't majorly impact his skills.

• Inside a room, Law can use his sword to cut anything.  These cuts can travel through the air and expand rapidly, the range only limited by the size of the room.  People, ships, and even mountains.  There appears to be no way to resist being cut if you are hit, although it is hinted that a sufficiently powerful user of armament haki could take the hit.  This is subverted when the most proficient user of armament haki in the series so far is cut in half.  Objects cut in this manner are cut normally, but people are not harmed overtly, simply becoming separate, separated parts.  People can still control their constituent parts, even though they are separated from the body.  A man missing his bottom half was able to run around with that bottom half, while cutting through hordes of people with his upper half.  If they can do it themselves, or a friend can help them out, they could literally reattach themselves to their cut off pieces, like a human Mr. Potato head.  However, this also lends itself to the next listed item…

• A series of techniques generically known as "Shambles" and "Takt".  Law can take any object inside his room and levitate, switch them around with each other, and even stick them together.  There was one point in the anime where Law was cutting up Marines, and then sticking their body parts to barrels.  There was another part where he cut up a ship and an iceberg, and made a crude building block tower out of them.  Objects can apparently be detached with some effort though, as implied by how the marines were able to get their body parts back on their bodies.

• Part of the previous ability that needs stressing is the switching around of objects.  If something is solid and visible, he can switch anything with it, including himself.  He can switch bullets with snowflakes.  Part of this ability is the implied usage of velocity control.  He can choose to keep the speed of the bullets when switching their position with the snowflakes, but change their direction to match snowflakes.  Alternatively, he can also simply stop their relative speed.

• Another part of the "Shambles" ability is that Law can switch people's hearts, which switches the bodies they are in.  To elaborate, he could take two people, switch Person A, and Person B's hearts, and suddenly Person B is in Person A's body, and vice versa.

• Teleportation.  Inside the room, he can appear anywhere.

• Scan.  Law can search for anything in the room, like an x-ray machine on steroids.  He can then use this ability to "catch" these objects, and teleport them where he wishes.

• Mes.  Law literally rips the heart out of someone's chest.  It doesn’t do anything to a person except tire the victim out, but the heart can be squeezed or otherwise prodded to torture them, and of course stabbed fully or crushed to kill them.

• Counter Shock.  Basically a defibrillator technique on steroids, delivers a contact electric shot.

• Radio Knife.  Cuts people like normal, where they aren't hurt, but they are unable to reattach themselves.

• Injection shot.  Law stabs forward, and then fires his sword like a gun or arrow.  Probably one of them more mundane techniques Law uses, but it actually hurts people.

• Gamma Knife.  Energy blade attack that quite literally destroys a person's internal organs, without any external wounds.

• Finally something to mention is that Law has been shown to be able to manipulate the rock and dirt inside his room to rise to the surface as a large spike.  This suggests that he has at least some ability to change an objects physical structure without physically cutting it inside a room.

So I want to use Law in a Naruto/One Piece crossover, where he ends up the the Elemental Nations.  Is he too overpowered if I want him fighting a lot of the canon foes?  Should I just strengthen the canon enemies, weaken Law, or what?

  Frankly, Law's abilities are overpowered as hell, especially since unlike most of his other characters, Oda never really set up hard limits on what Law could do. Though if you're just gonna keep Law like his canon self and throw him in Naruto, that could work. Just...you're bringing this up to the "rational" reddit here, and powers like that seem really ripe for abuse.

  In the rational Narutoverse, ninja fight with surprise attacks and one hit kills waaay more than one piece. There's no need for stealth when the only battleground is ships on the ocean. Anything along these lines, Law would be subpar at. Infiltration, information gathering, sneak attacks, surprise attacks, and spy ousting would all have the potential to seriously harm or setback Law. In a fight, speed would be his downfall. Ninja are used to rapid teleporting and switching due to kawarimi. I'm not sure how jutsu would interact - can he cut fire or wind? He can teleport, but can he bring others with him? What if he needs to protect a friend? Could fuinjutsu cancel his powers? If he cut a shadow clone would it pop or the pieces suspended? If he scrambles someone to another's body and they henge into their original body, are they still at a disadvantage?

  I think that this is because Law's haki was simply stronger than Virgo's and therefore he was able to cut him apart.

  Law's major (and probably only) real weakness is that his powers drain his stamina or whatever quickly. He can't really use his powers for a very long time, although if one really applied his powers to the fullest there would never be a long enough fight for this to effect anything.

  I'd recommend using his stamina as a limiter to begin with and then maybe Law can use rational reasoning to figure out how to overcome this problem.

    Thanks.  I'll probably do something like this.

  I think he needs to take time to 'create' his room, and the size of the 'room' is proportional to this time. The first part of this is supported by recent chapters [in which](#s "Doflamingo says something like 'careful! he already prepared his room!' ")
  ```

- u/Kishoto:
  ```
  I think, rationally, once someone got into Law's room, he had won. So I think you would need to tweak it such that preparing the room is, usually, too time consuming to feasibly use. Kind of like how Kakashis Raikiri (at least when he used it against Zabusa) wouldn't be feasible in a battle unless the opponent was immobilized. And even then, if your opponent is bound long enough for you to stand still and charge for a monologue's worth of time, you could definitely find a less chakra intensive way to kill them. So with Law, I think you could tweak it such that he has a hierarchy of rooms he can set up. So his One Piece one could be the fully realized form of this blood line. But it takes long to set. So maybe he can use smaller, less effective rooms to start with. Maybe he can only cut someone with a little bit more force than an average sword swing in his first tier room. And perhaps he  can only heal surface injuries with said first tier. If Law has his fully realized abilities from the get go, and isn't slow about it, the only tactic people can employ against him is "don't get caught in the room". Which means you'd be hard pressed to write good fight scenes, as it would involve Law either wrecking his opponent, or getting wrecked at high speeds (or maybe super long distances, I'm thinking Deidara would counter him handily)

  ```
  Law can control pretty much everything in his 'room'. But to be safe if the opponent is someone obviously stronger like doffy or admiral spec then dont have him swapping their brain or getting their heart because i think something is stopping him from doing this to stronger opponents. 

  Also when your done submit your fanfiction to fiction pad there is a growing [One Piece fanfiction](https://fictionpad.com/fandom/1003/One-Piece) community there :)
