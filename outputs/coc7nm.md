  Guessing you've heard of both of these, but just in case...

  Maybe [Goblin Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_Slayer) depending on exactly what you're looking for? Goblins are pretty awful, but it's more of a inevitability of their species than individual goblins doing awful things. The protag is very single minded about goblin slaying though, if that's the main thing you're interested in.

  I haven't seen [Dexter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter_(TV_series\)), but the premise is a serial killer who only targets other serial killers. I think it's more because he enjoys killing than because he wants to stop murders, but I don't know any details about the show so I may be wrong.

    Never watched Dexter but it's worth noting (given the subreddit) that Goblin Slayer is far from intelligent fiction.
    ```

  Death Note.

  The alignment of the MC himself is very much up for debate, but he for sure does not take issue with hurting & killing evil people.

    Perhaps... killing bad guys versus torturing them.

    There's also trying to reform them, or reshape incentives\*.

    The extreme end would be "you wipe out humanity, you wipe out evil".

    The main issue is that we're building something on top of "good and evil" which can be really ambiguous in usage.\*\*

    \*There's a RL claim somewhere that really good safe crackers take into account the opportunity costs around crime, and risk can be reduced via positive incentives as well as negative.

    \*\*Even if everyone was running around with really specific ideas of them, these ways seem different enough from each other that it creates confusion.

    I would assume that pro good would prioritize saving people/doing good than killing evil, while anti evil focuses more on the killing evil than saving people.

        ```
        A "pro-good" character *might* come to that conclusion, but an "anti-evil" character would take the point for granted.
        ```
