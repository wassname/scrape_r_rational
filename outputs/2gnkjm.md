## [DC][RT]The Fall

### Post:

So [The Fall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHTYFqs4VnQ) is a PC game with a pretty simple premise, you've crash landed on an unknown planet and your pilot is unresponsive. You need to find them medical treatment while also trying to deal with other AI systems with their own goals and methodologies. I think the game does a great job of setting up every character's goals and limitations to make things interesting storywise, and that's reflected to a certain extent in the mechanics as well which is always nice to see. At the same time, there are a few things that simply exist for a nice visual effect for the player, the biggest one being the AI's BIOS which displays all of its primary objectives and which parts of the combat suit it has access to.

Bear in mind that this is essentially just the first few chapters of the story being told, according to the developer the remaining two parts should come out soon.

If you're interested in buying the game it's on Steam and the Humble Bundle store, otherwise [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tYJgwaBxtY) is a pretty good Let's Play of the game in four parts.

  The aesthetic reminds me a lot of [The Swapper](http://store.steampowered.com/app/231160/), which is a really fun puzzle game that brings up issues and thoughts about human identity and copies of people but doesn't really present a concrete thesis (just raises a bunch of fairly interesting questions).  

  Note that The Swapper's been on the Humble Bundle multiple times and also has been quite heavily discounted in various steam sales at various times, so paying full price is probably not a wise investment of your money. edit: humble bundle has it for $10.49 USD currently, but it's been in bundles for like $7-8 for it and like 6+ other games too, so...

  I'm about 3/5 of the way through the let's play. So far, it seems to have the a theme that ties into FAI theory. Namely, it's problem solving skills involve utilizing solutions that violate our values, but are otherwise successes. Good example, sucking the baby into the disposal pipe to make it quit crying.

    Note that it is also possible (and I have done it), to shoot the baby for the same result.

      Huh. Cool. The Let's Play guy shot it like 40 times, but maybe not in the right place or the right time.
