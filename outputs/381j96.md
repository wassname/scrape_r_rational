  That was hilarious, and now that I think about it, makes a peculiar sense.

  Except, would the prime body even age if you are under polyjuice 100% of the time? How would it?

    I'd guess your real body is stored in a pocket dimension and only your soul is transfered. Can anyone who has used Polyjuice around here confirm they were hungry afterwards even if they ate during the duration?

  This is pretty great.
