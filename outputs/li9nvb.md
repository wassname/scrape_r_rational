  By the same author as [Hope and Silence in the Hive](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/hope-and-silence-in-the-hive-warhammer-40k-complete.583942/) and [Terror & Peace Among the Stars](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/terror-peace-among-the-stars-sequel-warhammer-40k-complete.672535/page-30#post-67895968), Onward To Providence utilizes truly alien perspectives to tell a story broader in scope than I've yet seen in another sci-fi story. The little glimpses of the bigger picture shown through each character show how truly *different* everyone is from each other. Even the human perspectives are altered, living instead on a >!giant world beast!< and having a society that can meaningfully interact with and exist as >!souls!< while exploring the implications of what exactly this means. There are some hiccups while the story is getting started in the early chapters, such as typos and a rather memeified human character, but these issues crop up less frequently as the narrative continues. Despite the rough start, this story is definitely worth reading. The semi-frequent art on top of everything else adds another dimension to the story, and bumps this up from *recommended* to *highly recommended*.
