## [D] Wednesday Worldbuilding and Writing Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Wednesday thread for worldbuilding and writing discussions!

/r/rational is focussed on rational and rationalist fiction, so we don't usually allow discussion of scenarios or worldbuilding unless there's finished chapters involved (see the sidebar).  It *is* pretty fun to cut loose with a likeminded community though, so this is our regular chance to:

* Plan out a new story
* Discuss how to escape a supervillian lair... or build a perfect prison
* Poke holes in a popular setting (without writing fanfic)
* Test your idea of how to rational-ify *Alice in Wonderland*
* Generally work through the problems of a fictional world.

On the other hand, this is *also* the place to talk about writing, whether you're working on plotting, characters, or just kicking around an idea that feels like it might be a story. Hopefully these two purposes (writing and worldbuilding) will overlap each other to some extent.

^(Non-fiction should probably go in the Friday Off-topic thread, or Monday Recommendation thead)

  Something I've been thinking about a lot is how you might get earth-like alien life which is overwhelmingly more or less competitive compared to Earth life: 

  One might for instance imagine that should we find alien microbes on Mars it might not be able to compete with Earth life due to needing long generation lengths (such as those among lithovores) and thus having had less effective evolutionary time to evolve (though that depends on a few assumptions that may not be true). Alternatively should we finally succeed at replicating something like natural abiogenesis in a lab one would probably expect it to be unable to compete with natural life due to a massive evolutionary headstart. So the most naive guess here might be that how long earth-like life evolved for would be the main determiner.

  Ultimately though I don't think the number of generations spent evolving (barring order of magnitude differences) is necessarily going to matter as much as chance. A major reason I think this is that we know that by [genetically engineering rubisco](https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/09/plant-engineered-more-efficient-photosynthesis) yields can be _significantly_ increased. This is simply because rubisco evolved for an environment where CO2 was vastly more concentrated and O2 vastly less concentrated and has seemingly been stuck in a local optimum for billions of years.             
  So the question is how many other local optimums did the ancestors of all or major groups of Earth life fall into? It could have fallen into disproportionately few (for anthropic reasons), an average number or even more than average. While we might intuitively expect much more efficient/competitive life to be more likely to evolve say complex multicellularity due to more available energy, there are conceivable reasons this might not be the case.

  In order to get a sense of what local optima Earth life might be in it is useful to consider parallel Earth's diverged from our own after the advent of life.
  It seems like there's quite a few different "stages" in evolution where local optima can exist, from conceivably before the existence of modern life's LUCA, to endosymbiosis, the development of multicellularity and later.

  Edit- question now better gets at what I'm asking:      
  **Imagine portals appear connecting our Earth to an uninhabited parallel Earth which diverged from our own some time after the advent of life. Invasive life coming through the portals is outcompeting and driving extinct species native to our timeline. What differences in biology would you expect among this invasive life by virtue of outcompeting native life?**
  ```

    > number of generations spent evolving 

    I'm not sure this matters as much as number of mass extinctions. Evolution doesn't normally have any way to distinguish between niche-specific and cross-applicable adaptations, because normally most niches are already filled with well-adapted life that can outcompete niche-switchers. After a mass extinction when many niches open up, species with cross-applicable adaptations claim more of them, making these adaptations more common across all niches. I think the build-up of traits like omnivorism, variable calorie burn rate, flight, and intelligence are what lead to super competitive animals.

    If this is true, this has a few implications:

    * All life on Earth has been through the same number of mass extinctions, so we have a skewed idea of how varyingly-competent life can be. We don't get to see just how dopey and slow early tetrapods were compared to, say, a squirrel.

    * A planet situated somewhere with many extinction events (due to meteors, say) is also situated somewhere where a 100% extinction event can happen, which life doesn't bounce back from. Planets that have experienced many large extinction events become rarer the more extinction events you're looking for.

    * If a bunch of cross-applicable adaptations are prerequisites for human-level intelligence, then this is a candidate for the Great Filter. Life is common, but it's mostly stuck in the local Cambrian-equivalent.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      While I certainly agree mass extinctions probably massively impact the overall "relative fitness" of life (compared to that on parallel Earth's) it seems like there's some issues with mass extinction _frequency_ as a great filter:

      We know of plenty of more turbulent solar systems which would experience more mass extinction events (if life can even arise and survive there), but we have no reason to expect most habitable planets to have vastly fewer mass extinctions.      
      From what I know it seems as though we are _already_ on the far end of the distribution for stability, so habitable worlds with fewer mass extinctions than our own should be even rarer than worlds like our own: Planets around smaller stars (which are far more numerous) are too close and have to deal with intense solar activity early in their life or even tidal locking. Our stellar neighborhood is less battered by supernovas than most. We also have an unusually large moon and a gas giant which shields us from many impacts.

    Tagging /u/Teulisch in, too.

    It's incredibly simple.  You just need something that photosynthesizes and has [inverted chirality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_life).  Literally just taking some regular Earth cyanobacteria, accurately scanning it, flipping it around in your computer, printing it out, and dumping it into the ocean would be extremely likely to cause a mass extinction event within your (now quite shortened) lifetime, possibly even wiping out all macroscopic life.  Chirality is apparently arbitrary, and it's a coin-flip which chirality life on Earth wound up with - but life can't process many nutrients from mirror life.  If a mirror animal were introduced into the world, it would starve to death.  If a mirror plant were introduced into the world, it would starve everything else to death.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      I should note though that inverted life is going to need other advantages to beat Earth life. Not providing sustenance to Earth life life isn't going to be enough, because that wouldn't immediately reduce how much predation it experienced or make it grow faster.
      ```

      - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
        ```
        > Not providing sustenance to Earth life isn't going to be enough

        Once it got enough of a foothold that it couldn't be trivially wiped out by good luck, I think it clearly would be enough of an advantage.  Anything that can't learn to avoid the mirror food is selected against, more strongly the more mirror food there is.  (This is even more true if the mirror food is actually *toxic* as opposed to merely being empty of nutrition; it's unclear to me.)  Anything that can learn to avoid the mirror food creates selection pressure in favor of the mirror food.  It would come to dominate one area after another, pushing other life out in a self-reinforcing cycle, and the only thing that could interrupt this process would be the introduction of something capable of digesting the mirror food (most likely mirror animals).  Even that scenario would render the global ecosystem much more precarious; it would just avoid a guaranteed immediate mass extinction comparable to the Great Oxygenation Event.
        ```

          >Once it got enough of a foothold that it couldn't be trivially wiped out by good luck, I think it clearly would be enough of an advantage.

          I should note a few things here: Mirror sugars and other compounds shouldn't taste noticeably different so evolving not differentiate them might take a while and/or only happen among rapidly mutating microbes. So the mirror life would need to establish itself first (without any initial competitive advantage) then stick around long enough for normal life to evolve to avoid it. I was also not imagining means of exposure that would be selective enough to introduce mirror algae without also bringing along a bunch of other mirror microbe hitchhikers, so any superior alien organisms need more fundamental advantages than just being incompatible with normal life.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Against_the_Chtorr

    this book series is actually about the terraforming of earth by hidden alien biome-seeds. most the focus in this alternate-timeline dystopia is on the actual fight against the big fuzzy worm critters called the chtorr, with some subplots of mature theme. there was even a GURPS book for the setting. 

    in comparison, there was an X-Com game where the aliens were trying to turn earth into a giant organic supercomputer. 

    in order to be mass-extinction causing, however, all you need is a simple chemical process. it already happened once when plants added oxygen to the atmosphere. get something that changes the atmosphere, spread it too widely for people to find and stop it in time, and that does the planet in.

      For this to work the change to the atmosphere would need to be both deadly to most life and something autotrophs could benefit from outputting. The closest thing I can think of that might work would be life adapted to use say chlorine the way we use oxygen. However for this life to be dangerous when introduced to Earth seems unlikely for a few reasons: The life would already need to be adapted to survive high oxygen environments. Chlorine is very reactive and building up serious levels of it in the air will take geological timescales. Chlorine isn't terribly abundant on earth in forms that would be useful to chlorine producing autotrophs.

      Overall it just doesn't seem like given the composition of Earth that organisms will be able to even compete with Earth life without an oxygen based metabolism. Simply because O2 is what's available for oxidation and CO2 a really great carbon source (since we're assuming carbon based life).

  The [SCP Foundation](http://www.scp-wiki.net/) is a collaborative collection of horror/sci-fi/fantasy stories primarily in the form of documentation detailing the secure containment procedures for a variety of anamolous objects, people, and places by the Foundation.   In [past discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2xn9h9/mk_challenge_how_would_you_munchkin_the_scp/) on this subreddit, its been concluded that the setting is designed to be impossible to munchkin, and it isn't really a single setting in the first place as various authors haven't been consistent with each other.  In fact, the website explicitly has a variety of [canons](http://www.scp-wiki.net/canon-hub) in which various groups of authors written their own takes, some focusing on different aspects of the Foundation, some introducing elements that strongly deviate from the standard generally accepted canon, some focused around particular meta-plots, etc.

  So with that in mind, what would a rationalist SCP canon look like, keeping in mind the following constraints:

  * Keep as many articles canon as possible, in particular the [classic articles](http://www.scp-wiki.net/heritage-collection-arc) that even people that don't know the setting very well know about.  Obviously, some SCPs have to be excluded because the imply stuff like the world is about to be destroyed or is already doomed and some are completely ridiculous.
  * For some reason, the world hasn't already been destroyed by anomalous phenomena and for some reason it hasn't been uplifted into a paradise by anomalous phenomena.  Try to come up with an in-universe reason for this beyond just anthropic principle (although many SCP articles imply or directly involve alternate realities/timelines).
  * Keep a reasonable number of common setting elements present (groups of interest like the global occult coalition, organization of the foundation, etc.), but feel free to heavily rewrite them.

  For my attempt to rationalize the setting, I would explain the setting with some sort of meta-rules to reality along the lines of Old World of Darkness or Nasuverse in which the collective perception of humanity influences reality.  The Foundation, at its highest level, is at least partly aware of this, and this in turn drives their obsession with maintaining normalcy at all costs.  This collective perception might also work against world-ending phenomena but the Foundation doesn't quite trust this enough to risk it.  Thus mass producing/distributing/utilizing a seemingly beneficial anomaly would both destabilize the collective unconscious consensus about reality and also run into weird problems. This doesn't prevent the Foundation from trying munchkiny ideas at the small scale and utilizing anomalies as absolutely necessary (in fact, certain key bits of 'technology' like Scranton reality anchors are at least semi-anomalous), but they are constantly afraid of this backfiring.

  For stories set in a rationalist canon, I would feature these small-scale attempts to utilize anomalies and how they succeed and backfire in various way, along with a overall plot about trying to scientifically test some of of the meta-rules of reality in ways that don't get everyone killed.

    The world is a computer simulation. All of it. This is known to the Foundation (who also know a number of proofs of this statement). In fact, the Foundation has managed to salvage text from a number of documents kept on the same computer (more on that below).

    Furthermore, the Foundation is aware of the purpose of the simulation. The world is being run by a university student (who has access via said university to Serious Computing Hardware) in an attempt to gain the necessary data to write an *incredibly* accurate history paper.

    Unfortunately, should the student ever discover that his simulation has *diverged* in any significant way from the actual history of the world, he will immediately end the simulation - killing all the people in it, including the entire Foundation.

    And the SCP objects which they contain and hide? These are all bugs in the simulation. A few computer viruses, some segfaults, the occasional snippet of unauthorised memory access (including the abovementioned documents), that sort of thing.

    The real aim of the SCP foundation? To ensure that the student never ends the simulation, killing a world. And it does that by trying, with every means in its power, to ensure that every time the Student looks in on Earth (which is at unpredictable intervals, and without warning) everything that he sees *looks normal*.

      I like this a idea lot.  I can’t recall any SCPs that use this exact concept (though I can think of a few with similar concepts).  I can see it making an interesting 001 Proposal and a canon hub.

      It fits the bleakness of the setting, eventually the student will have simulated enough history that they no longer need to keep running the Sim.  Hopefully they are in the far far future.

      I can see the sim using narrative-based bots and algorithms to save on computing power, resulting in some of the narrative-based glitches and anomalies.  If the narrative engine is meant to smooth out bugs, the Foundation might be willing to leverage it a bit, but not so much that it erases them.  This provides a way to incorporate narrativist logic and meta-narrative SCPs without it going OP or breaking reader disbelief and No-limits-fallacies on it.

      Memetics could be the result of viruses subverting the emulation of people to spread themselves and gain additional processing power.

      Reality benders and Scranton Reality Anchors must be using related exploits... perhaps a a flawed interface between the mind emulation and the world emulation enabling imagined constructs to directly breed through?  I can see some potential for a memetics/reality bender creating SCP that is also secretly the source of SRAs.

      If the Student is simulating multiple realities simultaneously (perhaps they have computing resources to enable many parallel processes but not to run them as fast they would like) and occasionally rolling back or resetting sims this can even be made canon with SCPs involving alternate realities and tine travel.  This also adds to the tension/fear if the Foundation can guess the conditions that will get their reality shut off.

      This does leave a question of the goals of the other Groups of Interest.  Does Marshall, Carter, and Dark know and just not care about the big picture?  Or to use a darker theory, maybe they know and are actively helping the Foundation by occasionally manipulating and blackmailing politicians to keep history on track.  Prometheus Labs know and is optimistically hoping to find a way to hack their way out (the Foundation is less optimistic, the Student might be a hack and an idiot, but the Future has mastered cyber security to an extreme extent).  The Wanderer’s library has more modest plans, aiming to get their stories and books out of the sim and into the “real world” even if they all perish.  While the Serpent’s Hand uses pocket realities and Ways made with carefully managed exploits to provide a more humane but riskier alternative to the Foundation’s and GoC’s strategies.

        Effectively being a faction created by and for (some subset of) the viruses.  There'd be other similar virus cults, too, with the Church Of The Broken God just being a collection of some of the most notable.

      I have not, thanks for linking it!  I have read a fair bit of ‘pataphysical’ (I.e. meta narrative based) SCPs (2747 is one of my favorite SCPs) and stories, but I missed this one.  Narrative as a metaphysical force (as in Discworld, Practical Guide to Evil, and Pact) does make for a interesting meta principle behind the mechanics of the setting but I feel on its own it’s too unconstrained to drive science research focused rationalist  canon.

  Hopefully this type of question is allowed here. Someone please correct me if it's not.

  Currently I'm outlining an epic fantasy project that involves the common, Tolkien-esque fantasy races. However, given that the story plays with some subversive elements of generic fantasy, I was hoping to make something unique out of these races. Or even come up with new races to serve as analogues.

  So what do you guys do to put an interesting spin on or deconstruct the traits of fantasy creatures?

  And, alternatively, if someone were to make their own races as analogues to common ones, what would you propose they do to keep it from coming off as simply a knockoff?
  ```

  - u/Rhamni:
    ```
    Personally, I get most of my ideas after binging something. Occasionally some of them don't work out and I have to roll them back, but I usually get something out of every binge. So if you want to put twists on different races, try reading/watching a long series with similar races. Maybe you'll find things you like or dislike about them in that setting, and you can change your own version accordingly.

    And if you haven't read the Silmarillion, definitely do that.

    >And, alternatively, if someone were to make their own races as analogues to common ones, what would you propose they do to keep it from coming off as simply a knockoff?

    Don't worry about it. Just do your own thing. A little overlap is fine, and to be expected.

    One thing I like to do when playing with a trope is to turn it Up to Eleven.

    For example: Elves. What are some of their core traits? Longevity, magic power, holier-than-thou attitude. So, our elves are a society of one-upmanship, competition and immortality pushing them to increase their power exponentially, until some eventually manage to ascend and become the gods that the mortals worship.

    Or, taking it another direction: Elves are graceful and beautiful. Using their inhuman charisma, they maneuver their way into becoming tyrants over the other species. However, they are still admired greatly, and it is as if they can do no wrong, ruling over their brainwashed citizens. The world is their stage, and every elf has a kingdom - their coming-of-age ceremony involves building up their own. 

    Another example: Dwarfs. Underground-dwellers, works with metal. Their vast empire lies deep, deep within the earth, where they maintain the clockwork that keeps the planet running. Or, miners and blacksmiths - they can swim through the ground like water, have a built-in metal radar, and can sculp a lump of the stuff into usable items with a flick of the wrist.

    Alternatively, you could also completely invert the trope. Elves become ugly, subservient slaves, a la Harry Potter or Santa Claus. Dwarfs become tall, thin, wispy creatures floating in the wind. I'm picturing something [Japanese horror-like](https://i.imgur.com/YQjAUmm_d.webp?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium).

    I’ve recently found some headcanons on Tolkien that make his elves a lot more interesting here: https://lintamande.tumblr.com.  One thing I think that makes these takes on Elves interesting is all the weird traits they have that emerge as extrapolations from their place in Tolkien’s cosmology.  

    So to generalize from this method, think of your settings cosmology and how your fantasy races tie into it.  Just having a unique and well developed cosmology is enough to add unique varieties to otherwise generic fantasy races.

    So one of the god’s craft dwarves from stone.  A generic enough starting point.  But how does this affect their biology?  Beyond just the standard durability and resilience maybe they literally eat rocks, or more generally they have the ability to interact with rock as if it were soft flesh (applying their nature as stone made flesh against the rock to enable them to work and shape and mine it easily).  Let’s extend this concept... elves made from the trees giving them the ability to work wood... etc.

    It might help to keep in mind that, when Tolkien did his worldbuilding for Middle-Earth, the wildly-inspirational world he created was ultimately inspired by and reflective of his own personal passions.  He was a linguist and philologist, who wanted to create a world for his invented languages to live in; he loved ancient mythological sagas and decided to write his own since no one else wrote them (at the time); he wanted to reconcile his love of ancient mythology with his personal religious beliefs.  And in recent decades, we have G.R.R.M's A Song of Ice and Fire, which is heavily inspired by his fascination with Medieval English history.  


    So, with the above in mind, my advice is to use your own personal interests, passions, favourite subjects, to inform your worldbuilding.  Maybe you're a fan of a lesser-known or -represented mythology and want to incorporate it, perhaps by drawing parallels between it and the Tolkien-esque model and syncretizing them.  Or perhaps you're more into science than religion/myth, you might love finding a way to make your worldbuilding a reflection of the Tolkien model mixed with natural selection, or genetic engineering!  Or if you're more into physics/chemistry/engineering, different race/cultures could have differently developed knowledge/technology trees (with or without magic), influenced by their different temperaments and or the resources of their territories.  A fan of boats and sailing?  Make the worldbuilding revolve around a massive archipelago (like Earthsea!), with each race/culture having its own seafaring style, or a lack thereof.    


    TL; DR:  Try to make your worldbuilding a reflection of what you'll love exploring and writing about.

  Is it possible for an industrial revolution to occur with an easy to use numerical notation system like Hindu-Arabic numerals? In the Avatar fanfic I’m writing I’m trying to see what kind of numerical system the Fire Nation would use.

    Society usually has advanced notations and concepts ready, but not wide-spread. Math in our history is often developed in advance of applications. For example, we invented complex numbers way before anyone dared to use them outside of math. Even now lots of people don't know about them.

    Some notations are used in only narrow fields of application. AFAIK, tensors are only used in some branches of physics. I would guess that other fields of science could use them, but those fields are not ready yet.

    That is not to say that math is always ready for new application, of course. For example, Newton had to develop Calculus in order to solve celestial mechanics.

    So, in Avatar universe you could just add a small group that has been developing mathematics in the background all this time. (Number-benders?)

    Also, in Korra's time the industrial revolution seem to have already happened. I don't remember anything about math there.
