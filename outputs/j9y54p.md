  I don't know the novel, but this sure as hell has me interested. The visuals alone are stunning.

    ```
    Blindsight may be my favorite sci-fi book of all time

      Did you read Echopraxia? That somehow managed to grab me even harder than Blindsight.
      ```

    ```
    One of those books with a reference list like PHD thesis (because the author is I believe a doctor of marine biology) and one of the hardest Sci-Fi Cthulhu arguments I've ever seen; also a great discussion on the nature of consciousness.

  Holy shiet! That's was awesome!
