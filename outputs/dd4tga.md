  Ok there are a lot of red flags on this:

  * Account was made today
  * The post contains only text from the story's description on the website
  * The description on the website has the text:

  >*You’re reading Chinese web Novel  “Beauty and the Bodyguard” on BOXNOVEL . Thanks!*

  When the website is not Boxnovel

  * All the novels on the site have 0 ratings or comments
  ```

  So... What makes it a good fit for r/rational?

    Simple. We are a subreddit that reads stories and this is a someone who stole other people's stories and is using them for profit. They don't care about what \*type\* of stories we read nor about the community; we read stories so might as well post here since it costs them nothing.
