## [META] We should have a [TH] tag for transhumanist themes

### Post:

Two works that would be best classified as transhumanist rather than hard SF were posted within the last few days: [To the Stars](https://pay.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g6ffg/to_the_stars_puella_magica_ad_astra_hsf_magical/), [Eclipse Phase](https://pay.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g1f7m/hsfish_eclipse_phase_a_roleplaying_game_of/). I am certain there are others.

These are not always rational or rationalist fiction, but the overlap in people who would enjoy them tends to be significant enough that they show up on this subreddit with some frequency anyway. Having a new tag would help tell them apart.

  Sci-fi doesn't automatically turn hard by being transhumanist.

    Exactly.

    Yeah, that got me in my late-night *To The Stars* post.  Oops...

    Yea, the fact the combination turns *other* things hard in an otherwise very correlated way just makes it seem like it.

  How many tags do we really need? I understand the need for categorization, but I don't think we need a tag for every single thing. If it's got stuff in it to appeal to the /r/rational folks, I think it's fine here, tag or no tag.

    Agreed. Tag it however you want, then add a comment that includes whatever caveats you want, or why you thought it would be a good fit here.

    Hmm.  Looking at our current tag system, they seem to fall into a couple of categories:

    * rational-ness of a story

    * genre of a story

    * I'm writing something

    * other topics

    To avoid tag overload, how about just removing genre tags?  That still maintains the distinction between posting a finished sotry, talking about a WIP, and general discussion; and I think simplifies the system nicely.  I'll do this in the morning, I think.

      Meh. I first added the genre tags to deal with the complaining about whether fics should or shouldn't be posted, and it's seemed to deal with that quite well. But I agree that [RT] and [RST] do away with some of that - brilliant thinking with those, by the way. Huge fan of the reorganized characteristics.

      Looking at the genre tags, [Mk] isn't even in the official listing, and [DC] hardly ever pops up. Those two can be lumped under "rational", anyway. And [[HSF]](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MohsScaleOfScienceFictionHardness) and [[HF]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Sanderson#Sanderson.27s_Laws) were just an experiment - for a little while, nobody posted anything here, so I decided to open it up to the Hard Fiction crowd (still underrepresented on reddit). I've been pleased to see many people posting stories with [HF] and [HSF] labels as time progressed, and I still feel like there are wealths of literature in those genres that remain untapped in this sub. I don't know how I'd feel about their exclusion.

      Up to you, ultimately. We chose you carefully, so I'll leave it to your judgement. I look forward to seeing your decision.

        **I believe in you who believes in me!  ~~Kick tags to the curb!~~\*  That's how /r/rational rolls!**

        \* *I made the tag system more systematic, and genres as an optional part.  I think it should work pretty well.*

          Thanks for the effort you're continuously putting in to make this sub more awesome!

      Removing genre tags does help make things more straight forward. I think though it might be a good idea to make an official thread about this before implementing the change. So you get more feedback on the idea and reach a general census. 

      Personally, I have always found genre tags useful before diving into a read. (seraphnb) And the [DC tag for example](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/search?q=[DC]&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all&count=25&after=t3_1vy3el) allowed us to post loads of relevant interesting content. Some that we might have otherwise hesitated to post under a RT tag - RT has always been serious business :P

        Clarified and made them optional, which I think is a good compromise.
        ```
