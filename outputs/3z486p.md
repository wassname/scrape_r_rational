  Hmm well might as well mention it again: As always with Dinosaur Comics, don't forget the following after you've read the strip:

  [Mouseover Title Text](#s " tied for first with that author in "stranger than fiction" who controls a real-life person and who never even TRIES writing "and then he cured cancer and all other disease, the end". WILL FERRELL I CANNOT ENJOY YOUR MOVIES WHEN THERE ARE PLOT HOLES THIS BIG IN THEM NO MATTER HOW DEPRESSED YOU TRY TO LOOK")

  [Contact Link Email Subject](#s " the backup moral is, hey, have you considered making all your characters Chinese sometimes?")

  [RSS Entry Title Text](#s " the other backup moral is that, in retrospect, i guess the sorcerer didn't need aladdin at all, that's weird")



  Also, check out [the sequel](http://www.qwantz.com/index.php?comic=2015)!
