  Not written by me, it's by George Frost. The two main factions appear pretty black and white at first but get more complex and nuanced as more detail is revealed. Other than that more detail can be found in the About tab on the site if you want more info before reading, nothing else is super relevant to /r/rational I don't think.

    I'm about a week or two behind in updates but from what I've read we're very very barely just getting to why the bad guys might not be completely evil. From what I've read it's been mostly hints rather than actual reasons.

      Well, it becomes pretty clear that the good guys aren't completely good either.

        This is more what I mean.

  Not the most consistently updated story in the world but still pretty nice.
