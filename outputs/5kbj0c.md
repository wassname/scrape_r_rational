  Uriel can't read the Other King. 

  Angels can't read Aramaic.

  Hmmm.

    Clearly the Other King is Jesus. 

    He's Aramaic (and thus impossible to read - cleverly foreshadowed by the earlier scene where angels admit they didn't know what Jesus was saying!), undead, and was prophesied to one day become royalty (by the Magi.)

  Oh Sohu.  You *knew* that following the message was a bad idea but you did it anyways.

      Sohu, the Comet King and Uriel already talked about the Hymn of Breaking Strain in http://unsongbook.com/chapter-36-my-fathers-business/ .

  I can see two leading candidates for the identities  of the Other King and John (the *Not a Metaphor*'s captain):

  1. The Other King is Rabbi Acher, John is the Comet King.
  2. The Other King is the Comet King, John is Rabbi Acher.

  I'm leaning towards number 2.

  I think that the two kings may have voluntarily swapped places, as each had something the other wanted (the Other King was a threat to the Comet King's empire, now a powerful military resource, while the *All Your Heart* was capable of giving the captain a chance to confront Metatron).

  I'm trying to figure out how the Cometspawn would die cursing the Comet King's name, and I figure him assuming the mantle of the Other King would qualify (assuming it isn't precommitment shenanigans or anything).

  Was that a compromise with sin?
