The premise of the AU is that Harry is lazy (and is sorted into Hufflepuff, but that's incidental, despite the title). But he's not "trivially" lazy, e.g. like Ron in the canon. He's *driven* to be lazy, and from that comes an amount of practical low-level optimization for less effort in life. That's not as good as grand efforts to figure out the Nature of Magic and end Death, but still I think this sub would enjoy it. Also, from Harry's very unconventional perspective comes humorous social friction somewhat similar in tone to *Seventh Horcrux*. 

Unfortunately, I think it deteriorates a bit in the third book towards the more standard "crack fic hijinks" (still entertaining, but much less relevant to this sub).

  Read ~3.5 chapters before getting terribly bored. It seems like the author noted down three lines of characterisation and declared those to be Harry's new personality, then quickly went to all the canon moments he thought could show of that cardboard personality and wrote a few sentences for each.

  Dare I say that the author's writing is *lazy*?

  It was a fun read. I'd say it's rational*ish*.

  Only read the first chapter, it didn't catch my attention at all. I guess I can see how the premise might grow into something that fits this sub, but the quality of the writing is really poor.

  I read this before and I liked it it was hilarious.

  I think this is very relatable and did "rationality" in a more simple/straightforward way than HPMOR. The authority figures (e.g. Snape) value hard-work so much that they make up work where there is no need to (such as forbidding the use of elfs in a specific house) and look down on optimizations or alternative ways to solve a problem as "laziness", all of which I consider anti-rational.

  ```
  Thank you for the rec. It may not be rational, but I was laughing non-stop with tears of mirth. I am on part-2 now.

  EDIT: it's also oddly inspiring despite not taking itself seriously.

  Belongs in the recommendation thread that just opened up.
