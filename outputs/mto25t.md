  I am highly entertained by this story coming off hiatus, even if only briefly!

  This is the only biology story so true to graduate/postdoc lab life that my (biologist) wife couldn't read it without getting panic-attack-level lab flashbacks.

    Is the actual biology it contains accurate, so to speak, or is it more that it embodies the feeling of /r/labrats? What sort of biology is it (e.g. cell & molecular, evolutionary & ecological, etc.)?

    (I'm something of a biologist myself, but have always found "edutational" fanfiction / webfiction a bit frustrating to read when it lapses into pedagogical asides, like I'm being lectured at by a mildly condescending ugrad lol)
    ```

      ```
      The actual biology in it is accurate _way_ beyond my own (relatively educated layman's) ability to critique. I think it's primarily molecular? Like, the recent updates have a ... not exactly divergence, a plot point? ... about the mechanics of coagulation, and at the point where it starts to get into exactly how the cascade works my eyes glaze over just a little bit. In the best of ways, to be clear.

  One of the things I really like about this story is that the skills aren't tedious nonsense like [Stealth] where the more [Stealth] you have the sneakier you are, or [Swords] where the more [Swords] you have the more likely you are to win a sword fight. That sort of thing turns every conflict into a question of who has more numbers or whose numbers run out first. It takes all of the joy out of things, both for the character and for the reader. Instead, we get stuff like a Rogue getting [Distract], where the skill is a tool in the toolkit, one that's very good for sneaking around, but which can be applied however the user likes, whenever they think it would be useful. It's deeply refreshing.

  The story is out of hiatus and the subreddit loved it [last time it was posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/hpgbzp/wiprt_i_became_a_biologist_in_a_fantasy_world/), so I figured I'd repost it here. The schedule seems pretty arbitrary, so idk how people would like future chapters posted. Maybe as a weekly batch?

  ```
  Pretty sure the author for this posts a ton of a low chapter novels to RR under different names, and then never finishes them. This will probably go back into hiatus soon.

    I can understand them feeling the pressure once a story gets popular. It’s a mental hurdle that I hope they can overcome because they’re a good writer and the popularity is because we support them not because we want to pressure them.

    The style of this author is distinct in a marvelous, technically detailed way. What other works has he posted? I've read through and enjoyed Essence of Cultivation.

      Hi, author here.

      I haven’t yet posted anything beyond those two accounts on RR, but that’s pretty accurate - I have huge issues writing a project long term. My fanfiction.net account(s) are just graveyards of stories.

      Hoping to keep [Biologist] up, but it’s starting to go on a downhill trend once the binge writing phase wears off.

        Can we do anything to help? it seems like you have a very unique and well needed voice
        ```

          Yeah, we need more *actual* rational LitRPGs.

        You may be more suited for short stories. An outline may be helpful if you don't already use one. The book Make Time may be helpful, the key concept for it is that you need to schedule time in advance for doing this type of thing otherwise it doesn't get done, you'll keep pushing it back to tomorrow indefinitely.
        ```

        - u/Brell4Evar:
          ```
          This seems like a good idea - do a story arc or two in a setting, then switch to a different one that you have more energy to work on.
          ```

      - u/Brell4Evar:
        ```
        Regardless of the completeness of your works, they're a blast to read. Thank you for writing, and please don't get down on yourself too much!
        ```

        You should probably plan for this. Know that you only write short stories. Go ahead and build a great world if you want. Then write a very short 5-20 chapter story in it. It can be open ended. You can tell yourself that you can always revisit the world, even if you never do, while moving onto the next story.
        ```

    Which novels are you referring to?

      One of their other accounts wrote Essence of Cultivation — https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/34710/the-essence-of-cultivation .
