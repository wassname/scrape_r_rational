  Well, at least this time Aaron realizes he's being stupid. That's progress, I guess...

    What he doesn't realize  is *how* incredibly, monumentally stupid he's being.

    >**Erica had taken peyote once**, and she told me the only safe way was to do it on top of a skyscraper...Yes, **Erica had told me, taking peyote** on a skyscraper **was totally safe**.

      Wait wait wait.... has erica spoken a name at all in the story?
      ```

      - u/Ninmesara:
        ```
        She isn't under the effect of the peyote now (actually, 1 day ago), because we have a whole chapter written from her point of view. If this doesn't prove she's clean then nothing does. Apparently you're only under the control of the Drug Lord if you have "therapeutic levels" of peyote. When the effect wears out you become free again.
        ```

- u/cretan_bull:
  ```
  Given that the Drug Lord already knew of Aaron's name, his location, his possession of secret names, and the SCABMOM with Ana, the ability to produce a biblical whale pun on demand doesn't provide all that much additional information. 

  Aaron really should have engaged in a lengthier and multidirectional exchange of puns that would have allowed him to detect anything inconsistent with Ana's individual pattern of punning.
  ```

  - u/monkyyy0:
    ```
    Maybe erica got kidnapped? What was the last thing she did?

    Being hunted by unsong doesn't exactly make having a rare name unlikely
    ```

    - u/Ninmesara:
      ```
      From that time when Erica tried peyote, the Drug Lord probably knows about the SCABMOM, Aaron's love for Ana, the whale puns and how Aaron looks like (so that one of the beggars and drug dealers probably high on peyote can identify him when he enters Las Vegas, and follow him into the hotel), unless she tried peyote before Ana discovered the SCABMOM name before she met Aaron. No need to kidnap anyone.
      The really hard part is how he knows about the discovery of Vital Name. He probably knows that Unsong is looking for Aaron and might be making an educated guess based on the flurry of activity.

  I've kind of stopped reading for reasons unclear to myself (story jumps around too much for me or something), but I have to say I'm very very impressed by the writing speed. This guy is a machine, and puts out more chapters faster than any web serial writer I've ever seen. I don't know if it's time or efficiency, but I hope other authors also figure out how to do it.

    Scott does 1-2 a week (all Sundays and some Wednesdays). Some others with a similar ethos in terms of always getting chapters out there:

    - Wildbow, of [Worm](https://parahumans.wordpress.com/), [Pact](https://pactwebserial.wordpress.com/), and most recently [Twig](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/) does 2 or 3 releases every week with great regularity.  
    - ErraticErrata of [A Practical Guide to Evil](https://practicalguidetoevil.wordpress.com/) does a chapter every Wednesday with great regularity
    - Mr Zoat of fanfic [With This Ring](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/with-this-ring-young-justice-si-story-only.25076/) has been posting an update every day for the past ~3 years.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Also, Ryuugi of Fanfic The Games We Play managed every day releases for 1.5 years
      ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think the entire first draft was written before the first chapter was published, and he's just doing his final edit pass week-by-week.

    Evidence for this is that (1) Scott had an "I won't finish [project] in 2015" prediction that he graded false, and (2) Rationalist inner-circle member Alicorn FLIPPED OUT on Twitter at the first mention of Uriel and Sohu as though she had read their entire arc already

    **EDIT:** Which, it's still awesome of Scott to have done it in such a way that the updates are like clockwork. Just, I don't think his method is to write 1.306 chapters from scratch every week.
    ```

    - u/bassicallyboss:
      ```
      Further evidence, though I don't have a source, is that I remember Scott mentioning somewhere that the story was mostly or completely written when the first chapter was released.  He also has mentioned that, given how long the story takes to unfold, he has some small regrets about not choosing a release schedule faster than ~1 chapter per week (but I don't have a source handy for this, either).  And >1 chapter per week of creative fiction seems to be pushing plausibility for a psychiatrist-in-training, even one whose blog posts are notoriously lengthy.
      ```

    - u/TheAtomicOption:
      ```
      That makes a lot of sense. I like it. 

      Isn't Alicorn the one that wrong Luminosity? I heard it was good, and I've read the first Twilight book (yuck), so I'd get the references. I'm just not sure I can get myself to reenter that universe.
      ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        It's not *that* similar, and IMO her books are the best rationalist fic that's been yet written.

        (Also, yes, can confirm that Scott had written the whole thing and had it beta-read before chapter one came out.)
        ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        The Luminosity series is good, if you can get over the fact that it has a happyish ending under circumstances that by any sane analysis should have led to a Vampire World War
        ```

        - u/Restinan:
          ```
          A vampire world war couldn't have really started. Non-vegetarian vampires can't really form large groups without people like Chelsea, so anyone who wanted to stop them would have had to try to go up against an army with at most four or five people. They would lose, and I'm pretty sure everyone out there knew that. You can't have a world war without more than one organized side.

          In the end, the golden coven has enough power that they could just hunt down and kill any vampires that didn't just do what they told them to. Alice alone makes any attempts futile, simply by virtue of letting the golden coven break up any attempts before they form. Globally unique precognition paired with overwhelming military power.

          I do agree that there should have been a few attempts at least, even if they would have fizzled. Maybe that could have been covered in the short stories?
          ```

          - u/VorpalAuroch:
            ```
            Alice alone just lets you see yourself dying. Alice, Nathan, and consultations from Siobhan pretty much gets you Path to Victory.

            (Also the one group with any expertise in organizing vampires, other than the one they just killed, was already on their side.)
            ```

          world wars don't happen when one group is holding all the cards
          ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            This is a cached opinion, and I don't remember enough of the details to defend it properly, but I didn't find it plausible that they would have had as much help *acquiring* all those cards as they did, given that their goal of enforced vegetarianism was known to the conspirators.

            But like I said, the series is *good* regardless.

              yeah actually i agree, i remember at the time justifying it as "hey maybe they all have latent guilt like some of those other characters"... but that's not great. 

              however really i was just commenting to be a snarky neoreactionary sorry
              ```

    Part of it is the chapters aren't particularly long.
    ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  So this basically confirms that there is insufficient divine light in the universe to run the Vital Name. Otherwise, this is a one way ticket to instant annihilation.

  Granted, that may be what he's going for, given that we do know the world is ending.

      Yep. In chapter 4 we learn that Sarah can speak names one thousand times faster than a human. In chapter 10 we learn, in detail, that magical duels (between ordinary people) aren't as cool as you'd think specifically because humans speak too slowly: (1) most names take at least three seconds to say, but firing a gun takes a tenth of that; (2) the Bulletproof Name is longer but protects you from exactly one bullet and therefore protects you from anyone who can't shoot you twice in five seconds.

      It is simply an inevitability that a Sarah Michelle Gellar golem is going to show up and curb-stomp a bunch of goons holding/threatening Aaron at an opportune moment. I thought it was going to be UNSONG goons but now the Drug Lord's looking good for it. A strong industrial base without Names should make for a good curb-stomp.

      Naturally, this will do nothing to stop the apocalypse.
      ```

        Sarah will be a bulletproof terminator that can be invisible, walk on air and rain fire and death on her enemies at 5 GigaNames per second. I's even possible she will get her hands on some kind of time traveling name too.

    It said earlier (or maybe it was in comments on the story) that the messiah will come into the world either among the most good generation, or among the most evil.  Obviously, the having the most evil generation around is very bad, and the end of the world is awful, but at least they get a messiah out of it, right?

  Thought the number of the beast was 616?

  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_Beast#616

  I guess that wasn't discovered in their world.

  Edit: Why isn't Aaron suspicious that the Drug Lord didn't ask him for proof for her? The Drug Lord just asked Ana for something that would let Aaron know he had her and she just gave it? How does the Drug Lord know that that is Aaron?

  If she's at the stage where she gives anything up without question then there's not much to save. 

  Guess it depends how it works if he's completely controlling her. What a miracle by the way that he needs both minds to get a name...

  Edit 2: The title of the story should be in the title of the post.

    Not necessarily. Just by making her take peyote, he'd have access to her mind and thus her answers. However, I find it likely he doesn't even have Ana, and just knows about the whale puns from the time Erica connected with him, while also knowing Ana is on the Not A Metaphor, due to his workers.

    > Edit 2: The title of the story should be in the title of the post.

    My bad, completely forgot about it.
    ```

    - u/RMcD94:
      ```
      Yeah I think I misremembered how peyote works.
      ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    The matter is debated and, more to the point, both 616 and 666 are gematria of Nero's name, in different transliterations.
    ```

- u/monkyyy0:
  ```
  I think it should be noted Aaron made a comprise with sin before this happened.

  Why did he keep the beanie baby secret? the 7th act/day of god was to make man while he knows the name that gives souls and he "stole" the 7th dragon; maybe just maybe he should have seen the significance
  ```
