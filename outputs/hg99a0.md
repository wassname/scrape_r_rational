## [D] Friday Open Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Open Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could (possibly) be found in the comments below!

Please note that this thread has been merged with the Monday General Rationality Thread.

    A summary -

    A New York Times journalist was about to publish a (supposedly mostly positive) article about SSC. However, the journalist or one of their superiors insisted on publishing Scott Alexander's real name in the article, which Scott thought would hinder his ability to work with his patients, possibly cost him his job and maybe endanger his safety. To make the NYT reconsider the decision, and to mitigate the damage if they didn't, he's taken down the entirety of SSC until further notice. It will be restored if the NYT promises not to publish his name, if they do publish it, it's staying down indefinitely.

    Right now, everyone is mostly confused. Why is the NYT pushing this policy, how will they react to this development, will the (nontrivial, if not overwhelming) pushback from other public figures and publications affect anything, what are the NYT's internal politics like right now? Nobody knows, and the NYT hasn't made any substantial official comments as yet. 

    Some fans of the blog are writing letters to complain, (agreed to be a good idea, so long as it's polite and presentable) some are cancelling their subscriptions, (if you do this, remember to specify why) while some are conspiring to spread misinformation about Scott's name to confound attempts to find it out. (*not remotely* agreed to be a good idea)

    The SSC discord server has closed invites due to a flood of new members in the wake of the attention, news may be found at /r/slatestarcodex and, if the blog reopens, the SSC mailing list, which is still accepting subscriptions. Stay tuned.

    What depresses me is that this has become a left v right issue, and all nuance has been lost, and this has become a story of the Evil Media oppressing SSC. I like SSC, and I think that part of this stems from a fundamental misunderstanding between both sides, but this has morphed into a politicized issue and so I cannot see this Ending Well.

  I'm almost finished with my next project, which I'll say is a collection of non-fiction stories and essays in the style of David Sedaris or Mark Twain.

  I want to sell it for money. What's a good place to self-publish a digital book? Amazon is tempting, but my problem is that I want people to be able to have the book without paying for it if they don't want to or can't.

  It's not for altruistic reasons. I have been to websites where people put free art up and have a little donation button in the corner, and I almost never give them money. But multiple times I remember downloading an album or game from an artist's website and a box coming up and telling me that the album was several dollars, but if I didn't want to pay for it I could have it for free.

  This is exactly what I'm looking for. The idea makes me feel powerful. I would be giving my work away for free while also establishing that it's clearly good enough to charge money for, which makes anyone who doesn't cough something up seem that much greedier. I don't think I can pay my rent with internet guilt but I am willing to try at this point.

  There's a trait I've noticed in myself that I'd be curious to learn if other members of the community share.  I look for and keep track of new technologies that would provide a benefit to my life, and then never implement them.  RSS is a great example.  I know basically what it is and I suspect I would benefit from using it more regularly, but I've thought that for years and never gotten around to setting it up.  Password managers are in a similar category.

  Does anyone else find themselves not implementing relatively low cost life improvements?  Alternatively, anyone have any similar life improvement technologies to add to the list of things to be implemented soon^tm ?
  ```

  - u/BoxSparrow:
    ```
    Not with technology, personally, but this sort of thing affects me every so often. For example, I had a rubbish bin that was rather annoying to use because its placement meant I kept having to walk across the room to use it. It took me months before I took the five seconds needed to moved it to a better spot.

    This is probably a form of akrasia, I think. Something that would have a long-term benefit but requires a small short-term cost makes the mind have a disproportionate pushback to doing it.

    I'm the opposite.

    Sometimes I set up some technologies to improve my daily life and it feels great! My life is improved and I'm really happy I did it. You should try it and you'll be happy you did!

    A RSS reader in particular only takes a few hours to set up and it saves you hours of compulsive checking in the long run; I recommend Inoreader.

    A password manager takes a little more time, you probably want to set aside an afternoon for that. Also, the technology hasn't quite matured, especially re: mobile and browser integration, but it's already quite useful. I personally use KeePass, but there's not much difference either way.

  Hey, can anyone point me to the origin of the maxim which goes something like "Every device can be defeated by a device which is less powerful, but more specialized"? Searching in Google or on TV tropes (i/h) has failed me, but I think I might have seen this here.

  The context is that I wanted to mention somewhere that Good Judgment Open (a prestigious forecasting tournament) didn't see the Zarda v. Altitude Inc. Supreme Court decision coming, but FantasySCOTUS (a lesser-known and less prestigious site) did, so I'm left wondering.

  I am becoming less convinced that most people actually possess theory of mind.

  Like, you can state that different people believe different things, and everyone will agree with that. But if you try to go any further than that, religious people in particular will fail to understand the implications of that. They know intellectually that people believe different things to be true, but they cannot be convinced that this means people will also have different opinions on their reasons for believing things to be true.

  We've all encountered the Bible-thumper belting out quotes from their ancient book, and we've all been utterly unconvinced by their claims (if there are any Christians in the audience, replace the Bible-thumper with a Jehovah's Witness or Mormon, or possibly an extremist Muslim Imam depending on where in the world you are). But if you talk with them and open with, "Why should I believe your book/interpretation is true," they'll keep quoting as if that has any meaning to you. They aren't prepared to consider that people don't think the foundation of their truth is true, and that this means they should react differently to those people than they would if someone were merely questioning an interpretation or claim made by the book. 

  I know religion is spiders, but that isn't the only context where this comes up. People who follow propaganda outlets genuinely don't understand that people who don't follow those outlets will see reality differently than them. They will then often conclude that everyone who does not follow their outlet is evil, when the truth is that everyone else just has a different source of information. Some doctors still to this day dismiss patients' concerns as psychosomatic, played-up to get a reaction, or straight-up lies, particularly where female patients are involved. US cops and their apologists genuinely don't appear to understand that the people they've been oppressing *feel oppressed.* The hyper-wealthy do not get exactly how angry everyone else is getting at them, or how dangerous this is in the long run.

  I think the term theory of mind does not accurately describe reality. It's not a switch, to be examined by psychologists doing experiments on toddlers to see when it gets flipped. There's a spectrum, and at the lowest end are full adults who will say they understand that different people with different experiences will believe different things while failing to behave that way, while at the highest end are those who genuinely believe people when they describe their experiences and why they have convinced them of different things. Just saying humans have theory of mind fails to describe reality as I observe it. There are a lot of people who just don't behave that way.
  ```

  - u/jtolmar:
    ```
    I've only encountered "theory of mind" in the context of child development, where it means a pretty bare-bones version of the ability to understand that people have different object-level knowledge. That is, whether you can pass a test like "Sally put her ball in the toychest, then left the room. Alice took the ball out of the toychest and put it in the drawer. Sally came back, where does she look for the ball?" Which is a skill I do expect all adults to have.

    Expecting people to model others beyond that level... yeah, it's sometimes a bit depressing. And worse when you consider that people seem to have a better theory of mind reserved for people on "their side" than the one they use for the out group / enemies / the underprivileged.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      I find this whole thing just...bizarre. Being unable to consistently model the outgroup should be a huge survival issue, but apparently it wasn't. Or at the very least, it wasn't crippling enough to get enough of us killed before reproducing that people capable of it outcompeted those who couldn't.
      ```

      - u/Bowbreaker:
        ```
        Being able to fully model the behavior of an outgroup makes it harder to kill them for the benefit of your tribe. It is also less important to model individuals of the outgroup than it is to model their general behavior and the behavior of a large group of them gathered together, in which case erring on the case of caution and expecting the worst is conductive both to not losing stuff to the outgroup and to motivating you to combat them.
        ```

    - u/best_cat:
      ```
      I will defends "Theory of Mind" as appropriate in this case, as the failure really is about '[False Belief Tasks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind#False-belief_task)'

      Most policy arguments come down to an interaction of (perceived) facts and values.

      For instance "(empirical claim) I believe that mandating masks will significantly rescue the spread of Covid versus not having a law" + "(value claim) Saving X people is worth adding Y legal restriction" -> "I believe we should have a law"

      Then, when I see someone disagree with my conclusion, it's because they're either working from different facts, or value the tradeoffs differently.

      It's *profoundly* common for people to not understand or consider the "false beliefs" possibility and just assume that there is a value difference.

      In the above example that looks like me saying "Why would they put their stupid ideas about freedom above the million lives that mass will save!"

      In contrast, the person could share my exact values on lives:restrictions, but not think that a *mandate* will do much above just asking people to wear masks. 

      (NB: I'm not taking a position on covid policy, it's just a clear example)

  Lol, Australia has started panic buying again because one state is having a modest rise in community transmission (from "practically zero" to "a little more than zero"). Meanwhile my state hasn't had a single case not linked to people entering from outside (who are under mandatory quarantine) in the past two months. 

  However, the pasta shelves were looking bare when I went to the supermarket this morning an hour after it opened, and there's limits on paper towels. The lady next to me at the self checkout had bought two JUMBO packets of toilet paper and bags and bags of bread.

  Those of you who are, you know, actually in mid-pandemic... you have toilet paper now, right? 🙄
  ```

  - u/kraryal:
    ```
    Our lockdowns are starting to end, but we never actually ran out of toilet paper. People would line up outside stores to try and buy it all in the first few minutes after the stores opened. 

    That made it look like there was trouble, but we never had any supply hiccups and at the transmission peak either enough people had hoarded enough or the policy changes had worked but there was toilet paper available most places at most times instead of only early morning.

    Edit: there's still enough demand that yeast is near impossible to buy so people who like making bread have to come up with alternatives.

      Here's the full history of community transmission figures for the state in question: https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-community-transmission/vic

      It went from 0,1,2,3 cases of community transmission between the 7th June and the 16th of June and now has been having ~10+ for about a week. (That said the past few days they've been doing random asymptomatic testing and whatnot so [they've gone from 8k tests per day to 20k tests per day](https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-tests/vic) - population approx 5m)

      They're going to walk restrictions back no doubt so hopefully it gets contained. Fortunately the other states have very few cases so we can share testing capabilities.
      ```

      - u/Sonderjye:

        That does seem like a poorly calibrated level of panic
        ```

        - u/MagicWeasel:
          ```
          I have to say, though, when I went back to the shops today to pick up some more things (I know, I'm  living such a charmed life that I have the luxury of going on *two* shopping trips in one weekend), I saw toilet paper, pasta, paper towels, soap, etc in large numbers and *I felt comforted* and *had an urge to buy some* in case I can't get more later (I didn't, FWIW). That scared me.

          Because what I *do* know is that in the height of everything, Italy, New York, wherever, nobody went hungry. I can deal with no pasta for a month if it comes to that :P
          ```

            I *have* heard of people going hungry due to coronavirus.

            But it wasn't because of a lack of food on the shelves to buy. It was that the people in question required regular, small jobs in order to earn enough to be able to *pay* for their food supplies. Not a failure of food availability, but a failure of job availability.

    Its an amazing storygame for sure, we were on the edges of our seats for large stretches. Is revenge rational? How much do you want to defect against cooperators? How strong of a signal to not defect do you want to sent to guard against defectors? And how effective are these signals? 

    That was my !rational take on it.
    ```

    - u/TheAtomicOption:
      ```
      Yeah those are legit questions the answer to which is always a result of emotional value rather that of moral principle. The amount of signal/cooperate/defect that is optimal isn't generally something you can calculate because you generally don't have the input values you'd need to do so ahead of time.

  If there are any American football fans, check out www.footballoutsiders.com. Their stats (DVOA and DYAR) and the reasoning behind them has made me a much smarter football fan (plus they have a bunch of really good writers), and now I want to understand soccer better too
