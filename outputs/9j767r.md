  I'm unsure of the HSF tag, but this is definitely NOT a space opera. Still, includes FTL and the like.

    To get to the bottom of Moh's mineral you've got to be talc, which is pretty solid stuff compared to non-minerals like cotton or fat and even colloid minerals like wet clay.

    This *is* space opera. Reconstructed, rational space opera. *Hard* space opera, even, by the standards of that genre. I'm just not not sure it's mineral-hard sci-fi. Still, if you'd said DC that would give people less clue about genre and this is absolutely a genre piece.

      What would qualify as a mineral hard sci-fi?

      A plasma modeling textbook? My calc 3 professor always said that field was all nonsense and fiction.

      Cant really think up of any sort of fiction I've read that had proofs and peer review backing up any sort of claims they make.

        Talc isn't that hard to scratch with anything that looks even vaguely like a rock. Neither is gypsum. There's a healthy chunk of stuff that's still approachable and entertaining. Niven and Pournelle are more than chalky enough, for example, without being able to survive abuse from orthoclase feldspar.

        FTL is only one of The Last Angel's sins, there's a uniformity and familiarity to alien culture, they all breathe the same atmosphere, they're mostly biologically compatible and can eat many of the same foods. Language compatibility. Space battles that are designed to be fun rather than make a lot of scientific sense.

        I *love* it, mind you. It's also strong rational in that the author has done both world and story design homework. Things make a deeply satisfying narrative sense, without much in the way of holes. Please enjoy responsibly.

        (...and, as mentioned elsewhere, this is a sequel to a previous work and spoils a lot of the surprises of that one early. Make sure to read it first.)

          these mineralogy metaphors are getting hard to follow XD

        Stephen Baxter usually does a pretty good job. It's far from perfect (what isn't), but it usually fits within accepted models. He's a mathematician, so probably helps.

          Agreed. Also the dark futures of Greg Bear, some of which are practically topaz.

          If you want to ease your way in on the crumbly end, there's always Neal Stephenson and Michael Crichton. They aspire to hardness, and give a sense of what you'd be getting yourself into if you went in search of hard sci-fi.

          I guess that's my critique of realism in Last Angel: It aspires to be great war fiction, great space pirate fiction, great haunted house fiction. Hardness isn't the goal at all, and if it would come into conflict with any of those other goals it's perfectly happy to develop scratches.

      Seems like should be [RT][SF][WIP].

  I cannot recommend this enough. Absolutely fantastic.

  Because of this post i began reading the previous novel and i loved it, thanks for post it. 

  I dont think it qualifies as hard scyfi at all though. Ftl, inertial dampeners, shields, reduce the hardness quite a bit, it doesnt detract from its quality at all. It just changes its clasification.
