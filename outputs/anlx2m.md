## Discord Server for WTC or r Rational in General?

### Post:

Is there a community other than reddit for ratfic? Barring that a community for WTC?

  A lot of rational-adjacent communities also use IRC pretty extensively. /r/HFY and /r/Parahumans both do, for instance. This subreddit does as well, and [here is the link.](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-rational)

    Where was it on the side bar? I'm genuinely shocked that I could've missed it, but I still cannot find it, despite being notified of its existence.

      At the very bottom, just above the list of moderators.

        Probably a new/old reddit issue. I'll look it over tonight and make sure the information is duplicated.

        Edit: Done, it's in a new widget. That information should probably be updated, given that it was written a few years ago, but I don't have a handy list of Discord invites, subreddits, etc.

  There is, as has been linked, an /r/rational discord server. I have to say, however, I didn't feel it was that much related. There's none of the built-in focus on fiction, and the resulting all-purpose discussion forum tends more towards all the other subjects the rationalsphere might feel like discussing. Beyond that, the place is supposedly drenched in internal politics.

  The alexanderwales discord is, best as I can tell, much closer to being this subreddit in discord form, in terms of content, tone and focus.

    Yeah, the r/rational discord just bears the name, there is very little relation to the subreddit or to rational fiction other than that. It mostly just acts as a social hub for the regulars on that server and their interests, which very occasionally includes rational fiction.
