  Wow that ending. Mind magic continues to be the best magic. Some fairly interesting philosophical points brought up, Neolu being an interesting type of person.

    ```
    I have always thought complex fantasy combat all boiled down to Physical/Mind/Soul if you don't have a good defense in all of them, someone good in one field could probably take you out in one attack. If you can't defend your soul, then one Avada Kedavera (Or whichever equivalent there is) is enough to take you down. If you can't protect your mind, you become a slave/brain dead. If you can't protect your body... well. You die.

    But you only really need to be good at **attacking** with one of them. You only need to win in one area to win the battle.

        I think it's generally good advice to specialize heavily, up until the point where you regularly fight things by yourself. A group of people each specializing in one offensive tree each will be better able to handle something over a group of generalists, because the single specialist will be able to defeat one area of something else's defences fairly easily. Say Zach, Hypothetical Zorian who only has mind magic attacks, and hypothetical Alanic who only has soul magic attacks, form a party. Each still has the same defences as they normally do. By specializing in one offensive magic each, they will be be able to overcome things with average defences in each tree more easily than a party of generalists would, because average defences in any tree would easily fall before specialized attack in that same tree.

        If you're a single adventurer though, or just an overachiever, then yeah you need to have more variety in your arsenal.
        ```

      - u/Caliburn0:
        ```
        Kind of. But that apllies to all of the three angles of attack. If the foe you are fighting is too physically powerfull  for you to do anything, and that is the only way for you to attack. You are screwed. The same if your foes soul seems impervious to your manipulations.

        So in order to become truly great you kind of need all three, but in order to defeat most foes, you only need to be good at one of them.

      Physical/Mind/Soul reminds me of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere Standard Model for Magic ([Realmatic Theory](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Realmatic_Theory)): Physical/Cognitive/Spiritual.
      ```

      - u/grokkingStuff:
        ```
        Yeah, great observation. Honestly, the magic system is half of what got me interested in this series. Wondering if the author made the magic system keeping the Realmatic Theory in mind or it's some kind of converging thought process among writers.

        With regard to u/Caliburn0's comment, I half agree. Zach & Zorian are good at all three magic types and it's something that's been building up for a while.

        Zorian is great at mind magic (being a natural mind mage and trained by the spiders) and not so great at combat (which requires a lot of mana reserves and his inexperience). So he focused on soul magic (hard to defend and useful with the mind marker) and left most of the physical combat stuff to Zach (who is so overpowered he literally killed a dragon to test himself). And they have the knowledge of a bunch of mentors helping them out to make up for their inexperience and to give them an edge over other people (since knowledge in this world is stingily given to others so you literally have to meet the creator/master practitioner to learn it)

        They've been winning because they're good at attacking with all magics.

    If it wasn't mentioned explicitly, then I think it's something that is obvious enough that it doesn't need to be elaborated on.

        Oh, you're right. It's probably still a reference even if the wording isn't exact. How many times do people say [large] cosmic power without referencing Aladdin?
        ```

        - u/thrawnca:
          ```
          Well, just searching Google for "cosmic power" doesn't bring up any Aladdin references at all. First hit is a Pokemon move, then there's World of Warcraft, something Hindu, and even the Silver Surfer.
          ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Definitely too obvious. It was mentioned directly in the chapter last time as well.

  So, they have the ring now. I wonder what cool useful properties does it have.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    Prediction: No matter what time period the user wears it in, it's always in style and never looks gaudy or tacky.
    ```

  - u/I-want-pulao:
    ```
    So far:
    Orb: memory bank/pocket dimension

    Crown: temporary markers?/ Mana battery

    Dagger: changes to template??/???

    Ring: ??/??

    Staff: ??/??
    ```

    - u/zconjugate:
      ```
      Why do we think it is the crown that grants temporary markers? Going by the orb, the time loop function is something related to the usual function (storage).

      Although I guess you can interpret "ten times bigger mana reserves" to be similar to "six times longer lifespan"? That seems contrived to me.
      ```

      - u/sicutumbo:
        ```
        Going by the theory that RR got into the loop by studying/changing a temporary marker, and that the marker is granted by one of the artifacts, then someone in Altazia must have gotten their hands on an artifact aside from the orb. Since the ring and staff are much harder to stumble on than the crown, and the dagger is more conceptually linked to removing people from the loop, the crown is the most likely choice.

        Also, crowns mark a person as important. That links it conceptually to temporary markers.

        None of the above is definite, but I would put money on it being the crown.
        ```

        - u/pleasedothenerdful:
          ```
          If the dagger is the loop remover, then doesn't that mean RR had access to the dagger? He removed the Cyoria web and a number of mercs from the loop.

          And doesn't that mean QI would have had to bring RR in with the temp marker?
          ```

          - u/zconjugate:
            ```
            > doesn't that mean RR had access to the dagger

            It's plausible that RR quickly broke into the treasury, grabbed it, and teleported out, according to a routine he'd perfected many time loops ago. He'd been looping for a while, he may have done all the stuff that Z+Z are currently doing.
            ```

          - u/None:
            ```
            It is unknown if the Controller strictly *needs* the artifacts to place temporary markers on or soulkill others. It is possible that those functions are embedded in the Controller Marker itself, and RR gained access to them when he Jailbroke his marker. Zach has limited Soul Sight and Zorian's marker is broken so they don't know that.

            Given what we know though, it is likely that RR had some access to the Eldemar treasury and RR somehow managed to barter QI for temporary access to the Crown.
            ```

      - u/MaybeEvilWizard:
        ```
        That was what Zorian figured it was in one of the earlier chapters.
        ```

    - u/zeropriority:
      ```
      Given that he loop has a fixed starting point and the thief took the Staff all the way to Blantyre (the hardest to reach continent), I'm starting to think that the staff has some kind of advanced travel spell/ability. 

      Maybe it can open a portal to a Bakora Gate from any location or something like that. Fast travel would be undoubtedly useful in the time loop.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Why do you think that the staff was stolen during a loop month? It almost certainly *wasn't*, since the loop would undo any such theft.

        The other 399 years, people can take more than a month to go places.
        ```

- u/slaw84:
  ```
  Chapter 77
  >The chapter in question described a small cult of mages, '**somewhere in Xlotic**', which worshipped an entity imprisoned behind some kind of 'dimensional veil'.
  ...
  >After repeating this process gods know how many times, the cultists eventually assembled a fair amount of information about this entity, which the cultists called 'the **Golden-Feathered Worm**'. To Zorian's eyes, it appeared clear that this Golden-Feathered Worm was actually an imprisoned primordial, even if the book never actually identified it as such.

  This chapter
  >He had barely finished speaking when the sandworm suddenly shook, almost like a dog trying to dry itself off, and a serious of translucent, glowing, yellow wings grew out of its sides. They were long and paper-thin, reminiscent of dragonfly wings, and looked comically inappropriate for lifting a creature like that into the air… but as the creature's many **golden wings** started slowly undulating like oars on a boat, the sandworm slowly lifted itself into the sky and then reoriented itself towards them.
  ```

  - u/distrofijus:
    ```
    This is a very nice catch, but I would expect imprisoned primordial to be much more powerful that his worm. Location/color matches somewhat. But:


    Zach wouldn't be able to hold down primordial.
    This sand worm should have god blessing (like hydra in orb). It is far too weak for primordial. Gives enough challenge for Zachs simulacrum. Responds to calls for assistance (like hydra does to drake chameleons). 


    It is possible that we would see some more god-bless guardian animals with ties to other divine artifacts ( if they are not killed yet ).

      Wasn't it mentioned that the primordials who were killed spawned a bunch of weaker primordials in their wake? Maybe this worm is one of those?
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        Nice idea, but...wouldn't that mean that the original Golden-Feathered Worm had been killed relatively recently? And wouldn't that have been major news?

        I mean, *this* worm can't really be the one that had a cult following, because they worshipped something that was apparently imprisoned and this worm was free.

      > The cluster of wings hanging above Hynth was probably Ghatess, who was allegedly a ball made out of multicolored bird wings – and only bird wings – and created storms and tornadoes wherever it went, funneling matter into the center of its sphere where it seemed to just disappear without a trace.

      Hmm, sounds like Simurgh...

- u/sicutumbo:
  ```
  I know it wasn't really mentioned much in this chapter, but if Z&Z can obtain the crown, who should get it? My thinking is if the Crown stores a fixed amount of Mana, then Zorian should get it. He's more efficient in using his Mana than Zach, and is currently much more limited by his small reserves. He'll take a long time to fill it up, but he could afford to use much costlier spells than he can currently.  If the Crown stores an amount of Mana based on how much the user has, then Zach should get it, because the total amount of Mana storage gained is much larger if Zach's Mana is multiplied than if Zorian's is. Then Zach could make artillery spells fall like raindrops. For a short time at least.
  ```

  - u/Nepene:
    ```
    Zach has more experience with high powered mana intensive spells, and would be more useful for casting massively expensive spells (like artillery spells) quickly.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      Even with that, I think the marginal benefit of giving mana-monster Zach an additional flat bonus is less than the benefit of giving mana-starved Zorian the ability to store huge amounts of mana. Zach can already cast just about any spell he comes across, and the crown gives him the ability to cast more of those. For Zorian, it is either impossible or extremely impractical for him to cast some spells that he certainly knows but hasn't practiced extensively.

      Put in other words, giving the Mana storage to Zach gives him a quantitative improvement, and Zorian a qualitative and quantitative improvement, even if the quantitative improvement isn't as large as it could be due to lack of practice.
      ```

      - u/Nepene:
        ```
        We've often seen situations where Zach would be much better suited to massive mana reserves. The fight with the hydra, this fight. We've seen other fights where others could better use it- Xvim ran out of mana, and generally served as an effective trump against the Lich. We've not so often seen Zorian run out of mana because he's so precise with his mana usage now and doesn't tend to use it in a flashy way.

        I'd imagine the crown would work well passed from person to person depending on the situation. 

        Mana regeneration generally scales with your reserves as well, so if that applies to the crown as well Zach may be able to do some utterly absurd things, like power a time stop. We can see.
        ```

        - u/sicutumbo:

We've not so often seen Zorian run out of mana because he's so precise with his mana usage now and doesn't tend to use it in a flashy way.

          I think in part this is because Zorian has such low reserves. In addition to him being really miserly with his mana, this means him being out of mana means him being *out*. Zach being low on mana means he can only cast a few more shields and some of his cheaper offensive spells. Zorian would probably just die against someone close to his level if he got as comparatively low as Zach does. Xvim did actually die when he got too low.

          Zach also regenerates absolute amounts of Mana much faster than normal people, so a sustainable level of combat for him is still very respectable.

          > I'd imagine the crown would work well passed from person to person depending on the situation. 

          Unless the crown can store multiple people's Mana, it wouldn't. Mana is attuned to a single person and can't be used by someone else with any ease. There was a world building post that mentioned this I think.
          ```

          - u/Nepene:
            ```
            Yes, so Zorian's combat style is well optimized for him having low reserves, and he has techniques and skills centered around that. Zach's style is optimized around him burning huge amounts of mana. As such, an artifact that lets him burn even more mana would make him a lot more effective. He can be much more wild and unsustainable, repeatedly casting massive spells that would before drain his huge reserves. 


            >Unless the crown can store multiple people's Mana, it wouldn't. Mana is attuned to a single person and can't be used by someone else with any ease. There was a world building post that mentioned this I think.

            The crown seems to act as a battery for a person's personal mana. We don't know if it also enhances their mana regeneration powers, but generally, if you have a larger personal mana reserve, you can draw power up faster.

    They'll take turns using it.  There's no ill will between them.
    ```

    - u/thrawnca:
      ```
      Taking turns is all very well, but they still need to plan who will wear it into a fight, because it takes time to charge.

      Actually, in some ways Zach makes more sense there, because Zorian spends almost all his regeneration on simulacrums, so it would take him forever to fill the thing.
      ```

  - u/myyx:
    ```
    it's interesting in theory but in practice, i don't think it really matters.  sure they may have it for a loop or two but they'll only have it for a little bit of time because it will be the last object they get before exiting the loop at which point they won't have it anymore. without the fallback of the loop, i don't see the point of risking their lives just to get the crown back from QI.
    ```

  - u/KamikazeHamster:
    ```

  1. This was a great insight into QI (relating it to city kids being squeamish about knowing how animals died). It's been said before but really well related to what we can relate to even today. Also, maybe nobody103 didn't appreciate being told his style for QI's speech was off - with Zach saying he was similarly informal each previous time he interacted with Zach. I hereby tender my apologies to the author :D

  2. Sulrothum are way more scarier if they have access to wards and the like. 

  3. Sulrothum soul mage?! They were supposed to have access to magic, but this high? 
  4. Any way to trade with them for soul magic? Maybe the battle priest would be interested. If they can meet and just get the ring and bounce....
  ```

  - u/Xtraordinaire:
    ```
    Our own society is a mixed case though. Old speech patterns are more fanciful (to us, by virtue of being rare and exotic) but the part about urban kids being kinda pussies holds true. Old times were harsh, and raised equally harsh men.
    ```

    - u/I-want-pulao:
      ```
      Doesn't have to be all urban kids though - I bet the kids growing up in urban Venezuela now are pretty tough. Or those kids in Syria or Afghanistan... Harsh times beget tough people.
      ```

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    soul magic is not any more difficult then any other type of magic, so there's nothing "high" about soul magic, the reason why it's "rare" is that the church activly discourage people from it's use. it does require you to gain soul sight though if you want to do any significant with it since it is hard to aim for something you can't see.

    mind magic is more difficult since it require very fine manipulation, and for people that are not psychics it's like trying to operate with a blindfold. you can do it but you're way more likely to cause lasting harm.
    ```

- u/Zorian42:
  ```
  1) I really like that nobody103 is reading this reddit and corrects the possible flaws we find in each chapter. Like explaining QI's attitude (he acted a lot like a teenager in last chapter), or how to exploit his knowledge. Z&Z would probably do it the same way anyway, but they explicitly talk about those issues now, so everyone knows they're aware of them.

  2) I'm kinda disappointed Zorian wasn't studying Zach's blessing as the very first thing after the previous chapter. That's exactly what I would expect him to do - if he could somehow cast even very weak copy of the blessing, it would still be a low hanging fruit for him - it would magnify all his powers. Maybe it's only 'cast-once' enhancement (blood magic?), so he has to train very hard to be able to do it well? Still weird that he wasn't even interested in it this chapter, though ...

  3) I do find the fight a bit disappointing, too. We were used to having detailed descriptions of fights (invasions, fight against QI, god-touched hydra, even last time on the airship - where we only see the simulacrum on one airship fighting), but now we just learn that the simulacrum teams sacrifice themselves / outright die. I understand that having free clones of main characters makes the clones expendable, but it still seems weird in-universe - it would make sense if they had some sort of agreed upon limits to what mana they can use, but nothing is said in the chapter.

  4) Looking forward to how they change the attack at the Ziggurat in the next loop. They should be able to get more support - I really thought 20 mages is not that much, considering how many they had previously (I know - different fights, different continent - but still!). It's again not explicitly said, but I expect that they have to move quickly before some sulrothum reinforcements arrive. So they cannot just wait and kill all the sulrothum that come outside - and then go inside with all the resources they have. They still should try to loot everything there is in the Ziggurat, though - but that would most likely require them to kill every sulrothum around ...

  5) We learned two new things that Zorian doesn't really understand now - some subtle wards aroung the Ziggurat and some sulrothum mind defenses (that he's obviously able to overcome, but it costs him a lot of mana). The wards can be either broken -> the strategy for getting the ring remains the same (attack group for distraction + infiltration group for getting the ring), or maybe it's not wards but some innate ability of sulrothum - which would require change in strategy (see 4) - maybe one frontal all-in assault? ). The mind defense could be a bit more tricky - but Zorian loves exotic spells / shaping exercises, right?

  6) Another option I can think of - they've already been inside the Ziggurat and there obviously aren't any anti-teleportation wards -> next restart they can just teleport inside, open portal and attack from the inside. With distraction from outside or without. I still think the high priest will have some interesting loot on him (beside the artifact ring).

  7) 
  > Zorian did find it kind of interesting how many otherwise obscure groups and individuals were roused into action as a result of their theft, though. Perhaps it would be a good idea to stir up some similarly great outrage back in Altazia, just to see if something particularly interesting would show itself in its wake…

  Attack on the royal tresury, getting all the interesting stuff (books, artifacts, basically anything useful) and running away should do the trick. (Although it says 'stir up outrage Altazia', which is continent containing splinter states, not Eldemar). Maybe they're gonna stir up outrage in every splinter state, to find all the interesting parties?

  8) 
  > "Yes, but I had another idea about that," Zorian said. "What if… we recruited his help in breaking into the Eldemar's royal vault?"

  Ou yeeeeah!
  ```

  - u/distrofijus:
    ```
    regarding study of divine blessing - I'm pretty sure neither Zach nor Zorian are proficient enough in soul magic to study reflection of divine magic on soul. QI was bragging (and he had enough proficiency to brag enough) about how few mages are able to study them. 

    3). The sacrifice thing is not that far fetched. While simulacrums wouldn't do what the originals won't, both Zach and Zorian (especially Zach) are OK with sacrifice since they are in time loop and it bears little harm. Zorian is less keen to die, but they are kinda immortal, so sacrifice could work for them. 

    4-5). As for further strategies - the sulrothum empire has some very interesting things, but most likely they will be postponed for post-loop period. They will have to interact with them a lot until they learn the high priest location, but I'm not sure if there is a way to unearth the method for wards/mental defenses of the sand worm. There's always kindnap/mindrape thing, but it won't work out as well as it work for aranea  (due to distributed nature of their colonies and smaller self-sustaining communities to kill). The sulrothums live in the single place and it is too large to conveniently incapacitate/interrogate them. But if they find out the high priest location for ring, if they manage to disable the priest without raising a lot of fuzz, I don't see any reason Zorian wouldn't scry his mind for any useful knowledge


    The point about stirring up the situation sounded very interesting to me as well. There's immortal eleven we didn't hear about yet. There should be many more old powerful secluded geezers duo hadn't met yet.

- u/rational_sith:
  ```
  Yet another way to escape the time loop: the Guardian of the Threshold refuses to operate with bodies that have soul, but there are bodies that have not.

  [Chapter 26](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/26/Mother-of-Learning):
  >The process of possessing a new body is not that fast for a lich – they need a whole day at the minimum, and that's assuming they already have a new body ready to go.

  Surely Quatach-Ichl has at least one, so Zorian could possess the reserve lich body (maybe even the main one). 
  I suppose that Zorian is competent enough to control it.
  [Chapter 62](https://www.fictionpress.com/s/2961893/62/Mother-of-Learning):
  >the simulacrum is one of the major stepping stones towards becoming a lich. If you can cast that, you're halfway there already.

  ```
  Wow. Getting that ring is going to be a huge pain every time they attempt it. Maybe they can try some diplomatic approach to reach the high priest in the future before pulling the same mind magic attack?

  Did we know it was a ring before this chapter? It was mentioned very offhandedly so I am assuming yes, but I thought it was still a question mark over which of the two remaining artefacts they would find.

  Very interesting in knowing the rings abilities. Also, it seems likely that it will have some hidden time-loop related abilities. If it does, that strongly suggests that all 5 key pieces have bonus power for Zach and Zorian which is a definite plus.

  I like that Z&Z discussed the unneeded danger QI imposed on himself with the flashy dagger storage last chapter. I remember some discussion in the comments of people trying to decide why he would do that.

    > Getting that ring is going to be a huge pain every time they attempt it. Maybe they can try some diplomatic approach to reach the high priest in the future before pulling the same mind magic attack?

    I doubt it will be as difficult on repetition. If they know where the priest is, they can either ambush him as soon as he leaves the temple, or they could find out where he is in the temple, teleport to him, take the ring, and leave. Maybe not simple, but achievable since I don't believe the wasps have wards good enough to detect Z&Z outside the temple nor restrict scrying and teleportation. The ring certainly has anti scrying defences, but it's much easier to find the priest.

    What about accessing the Bakora Gate network?

    We know that there's *some* kind of proper way to do it, and being able to travel around the world would be very handy for a Controller. And the "Gate spirit" has some kind of involvement with soul magic, but doesn't respond to normal attempts to contact it.

    Also, the orb had a helpful-but-not-critical loop management power. What if one of the others follows that trend and allows the Controller to access the Gate/Guardian remotely?

      Not likely. This would imply that gate network was created by gods.
      ```

      - u/thrawnca:
        ```
        That's not impossible. Or, there is some other gate access method too, but the gods took advantage of the network when creating the imperial artefacts.

        I was just trying to think of magical feats that are within the bounds of possibility, but beyond what mortals can normally do. And that would be quite helpful for an emperor or Controller.
        ```

        - u/distrofijus:

          My personal take on Bakora Gates is that they were created by civilization which were holding sovereign gate prior current magic civilization. Someone spent some time in time loop to do enough research to create Bakora network. The divine artifact was created earlier than a gate network.

    Nope, none so far. I'm guessing a ring is kinda an access card though, kind of like the calling rings in Kingkiller Chronicles (Patrick Rothfuss). Maybe I'm wrong but that feels intuitively right to me. As for its purpose in the time loop, it could be access to the maker? I'm reaching here.

    Orb = info storage
    Dagger = Template change
    Crown = Soul Markers (esp since QI was the one that put Zorian in the loop)
    Staff = Rare magics? I got no clue? 
    Ring = Access card into maker and other information?

    Just like the Orb, Dagger, and Crown serve important (but basic!) cases in the loop, the staff and ring should have something similar going on.
    ```

    - u/sicutumbo:
      ```
      If I had to make a serious guess, I think the ring's ability would deal with subtlety or disguise in some way. Rings are small and unobtrusive, so hiding the wearer from perception in some way makes sense. That said, invisibility and physical transformation are already achievable, so maybe something like being able to convince anyone that you are whoever you say you are? Kind of a stretch, and I'm not really sold on this line of thought.

      Alternatively, rings in medieval times were used to stamp things with the king's personal seal, in order to verify that something had come from the king. Convincing other people makes some sense again, or maybe some form of true sight.

      The staff makes a lot of sense as a magic weapon. The ability to shape ambient mana as if it were your own would be monstrously OP, so I think that's out. Maybe the ability to cast any spell that you are able to cast, but at maximum efficiency? Or cast spells almost instantly? Thats kind of what staves do in this setting, although they're much more limited. Would have a very nice synergy with the crown, and would be amazing for Zach.

      Oh, maybe the crown is for Mana storage, the staff for Mana shaping, and the ring for Mana generation? Each is very strong on its own, but synergizes extremely well with the other artifacts.
      ```

        >Oh, maybe the crown is for Mana storage, the staff for Mana shaping, and the ring for Mana generation? Each is very strong on its own, but synergizes extremely well with the other artifacts.

        If the ring is the symbolic source of power (as the seal) then it makes sense for mana generation. However, I'm not too convinced since the crown is the biggest symbol of authority. But well reasoned! I 100% agree with the staff - especially with the almost instant spells would be really useful, but not terribly OP. Could they beat the lich with something like that? Assuming they do NOT have the crown ofc.

          >  I 100% agree with the staff - especially with the almost instant spells would be really useful, but not terribly OP.

          Instant spells would probably be better against QI than huge amounts of Mana. Combat magic, as explained in the most recent wordbuilding post, is basically any magic that has a use in combat and is quick to cast. You can't spend an entire minute casting a single devastating spell, because you're dead by then. Getting better at combat is generally about getting quicker to cast the spells you already know. If you aren't limited by how fast you can cast spells, or are at least a **lot** better than your opponent at casting quickly, you can overwhelm his defences because you can launch so many attacks before they can cast a defence.

          Remember how devastating QI was when he sped himself up with time magic? And why he needed to do so in the first place? He had a bunch of attacks coming at him, and not enough time to erect defences. And then he blocked all those and launched attacks that were quick enough that some mages didn't have time to defend against them. Imagine being able do that effectively permanently. Launch multiple attacks so that anyone you face has to either dodge (sometimes not possible), or have generic defenses that aren't nearly as efficient at stopping any one type of spell. And then just continually throw out cheap spells that the enemy has to respond to individually.  Even if you don't have nearly as much Mana as the other guy, you can quickly drain him dry. I think in most cases, you could beat the other guy by firing two near simultaneous attacks that can't be blocked by any single defence. Xvim's shieldbreakers plus a force lance, or something like that.

          It wouldn't be unbeatable, because you're still limited by your reaction time, personal spell knowledge, and Mana reserves, but I think it's of a similar level of OP as the Crown. In combat anyways.
          ```

          - u/I-want-pulao:
            ```
            So it's OP enough - just the right amount of OP. (the crown gives QI massive mana, but he still has to deal with Alanic, Xvim, and others. Oh, and he is no one man army - he did get beat in the Necromancer's war.

            This was a great chapter, but I missed getting battle details. I hope if this guess is correct, we'll get a pretty OP battle between ZnZ (+company!) and QI!

  He's only been in the loop for 7yrs? This is confusing on multiple levels, I thought he was well into decades by now, and Zach even further

  ```

  - u/Avidya:
    ```
    The nature of these time loops give them several advantages that those going through time regularly would not have:

    1. **Effectively Infinite Money**: After learning the locations of large mana crystals, easy-to-acquire-but-rare ingredients for alchemy, lost treasures, etc., they start off every loop with plenty of funds. This lets them buy secrets, tutors, training equipment for learning spell formulae, and whatever else they please.

    2. **Risk Taking Without Risks**: Zach practiced his combat skills by taking on a dragon alone. Without the loop, he would be risking death from trying such a stunt. With the loop, if he dies, then he's back to square one. They can learn dangerous spells that might harm them during the learning process because all of their injuries (sans soul damage) recover at the start of the loop.

    3. **Blatant Criminal Activity**: They stole an airship and killed several individuals in the process to acquire an easyish way to get to a distant continent. Outside the loop, they would forever have a country hunting them down, and their morals might stop them from killing the guards, but inside the loop, the deaths don't amount to much.

    I'm sure I'm missing some, but this list should be enough to make my point: Zorian hasn't lived a normal seven years, he's lived a jam-packed, study-filled, adventure-laden time that even royalty couldn't get on the outside to the same degree.

    One last thing of note would be the time dilation rooms. Zorian mentions that he's been in the loops about seven years *not counting the rooms*. 
     These give extra weeks every loop of practicing mana shaping exercises that Xvim states are the bread and butter of archmages, improving their casting abilities that much more.
    ```

    - u/melmonella:
      ```
      It was also mentioned at one point that teachers usually refuse to teach someone that was taught by another teacher, so outside of the loop signing up for a teaching course locks you out of other teaching courses. This isn't the case here. 

      Next, some teachers undoubtedly require convincing to even start teaching you. Here they can perfect their convincing over multile restarts with little to no consequence.

      Finally, trading secrets. Outside of the loop it's not possible to nearly as large a degree as they are able to do here.

    - u/thrawnca:

      Don't forget, basically a combination of 2 and 3, *shamelessly ransacking the minds of top-level experts like Sudomir*. It's well known that despite the efforts of public education, there is a whole lot of good stuff that mages already know how to do, but keep to themselves. ZZ can beg, buy or outright steal most of it.

      From what I can tell, there are basically three challenges that people face in a magical career, and if you can deal with all three, you can be good at everything.

      1. Cost of ingredients. This affects alchemy and golem-making. Obviously a non-issue.

      2. Precision. This includes disciplines that need excellent shaping, and also eg spell formulas that need careful programming. Zorian has the right mindset for this, he had the right mentor, he had motivation due to his need for efficient mana usage, and he had lots and lots of time where shaping exercises were about all he could do (early loops, black rooms, etc).

      3. Obscure knowledge. Lots of the best combat spells are not exceptionally hard to cast, merely restricted in the library. ZZ have raided all kinds of secret and illegal stashes.

          idk if we've been reading the same story, what makes you think xvim is his match 1v1? he's strong, but he seems to die pretty easily in their attacks lol.

          zach is the only normal character we've encountered that i'd say has a really solid chance, since he can just nuke zorian from orbit with bottomless mana lol. 

          on the other hand, all zorian has to do is mental attack if zach has no barrier up, so there's that. zorian is a lot craftier with better control where zach is stronger.

          >but he've been in the loop for decades polishing his combat magic with lots of resources, targets and interest to do so.


          I don't even think he's been in it for DECADES has he? zorian is only up to 7yrs, zach wasn't in it for decades before zorian.. like.. A decade maybe? i'm really confused at the timeline tbh.

            Both Alanic and Xvim would win vs zorian in a straight up fight, zorian is not a godlike mage, he's a superior mind mage and crafter but he lose pretty much all his combat viability as soon as someone have a mental shield, there was a reason he was pretty much a tag-along when they attacked the ritual plattform with the battle group while Xvim joined the actual fighting.

            Most of zorians power comes from items, that take time to craft so he's very dangerous with prep time since he can craft them, but that's only really viable if you're the one picking a fight if zorian just suddenly found himself in combat he'd be in deep trouble.

            Zorian is basically an engineer, he build stuff, and he knows how stuff works, he's just bare minimum when it comes to combat, just like you would not call a weapon manufacturer a great warrior, but given time he can build a weapon for any situation.

            Zach is the combat mage, he can beat basically anyone.

              yeah i'm not saying he's godlike, but i don't see how alanic/xvim would dominate him, not in what we've been shown in the story. yeah they're both very powerful in their own right, which is why they always recruit them.. but even then, they often go to alanic for his  contacts and ability to recruit even more people, than his skills directly.

              plus, zorian has shaping skills solidly on par with xvim by now no? 

              >there was a reason he was pretty much a tag-along when they attacked the ritual plattform with the battle group.

              because his mana capacity is already super stretched by the simulacrums, who are simultaneously burning it up.. where the others in the party without simulacrums have full mana?

                does not apply since he had no active simulacrums then.

                okey what combat spells have you seen from zorian that are so good?, he solves most problems by chugging explosives at them, acid, or incediaries, and the only spells he often use on regular basis are moment and detection based, like teleport, divinations, gate & invisibility, he got a mean magic missile but that is a really basic spell.

                most of the time he uses mind magic, and he uses it on scrubs since they can't defend themselves like a mage can, he's still horribly outmatched against most mages it's just that mages are relativly rare so most of the time it's like fighting against swords with a ak-47.

                Alanic especially would just douse the entire area in fire and call it a day with fire manipulation, sure zorian would use fire wards since he knows Alanic is heavily specialised but still Alanic is a really powerful mage or he would not have lasted against the lich when it was "disarmed".

                  > does not apply since he had no active simulacrums then.

                  his simulacrums had been burning his mana the whole time? I don't exactly remember mana regeneration rates, but they're not in a mana rich area so... slow?

                  hmmm i swear he (earlier on, pre-zach) was practicing plenty of combat spells, when he actually needed them, not just magic missile? and only shifted focus once he teamed up with a living-breathing combat spell? (and that zach isn't great with any kind of complex magic unless he can brute force it with bulk mana)

                  what about alanic?

                  plus, afaik, MOST mages don't have good mind defences, or any of any sort, just the top tier ones? and even then, only a very small number have something impenetrable in place?

                    Alanic not having mind defenses would surprise me due to how combative he is, and he knows the value of good defense or he's not be so angry at zorian for neglecting soul defenses.

                    zorian can cast, flamethrower, severing disc, incinirating ray, plasma whip, fireball and flame vortex. where off incinirating ray and flame vortex burn pretty much all his mana and he can't cast too many fireballs either.

                    Cyoria is like one of the most mana filled area on the planet, zorian can recharge pretty fast there by absorbing ambient mana, and they were diving into the hole the actual most mana rich area on the planet (that we know off) so not very slow at all he should have had full mana when they started the assult without any issues.

                    the in depth shaping books are because zorian should look for shaping exercises that are good for the spells he wants/needs to cast, rather then xvim not knowing more, but why study something you wont have any use for when pressed for time as they are now.

                    mind defenses are super common, he states that pretty much every mage knows them in the early chapters when he just started learning mind magic, however most don't use them permanently and only activate them when they find them relelevant (like in combat), MIND BLANK however is hard to cast and used by a much smaller amount of people.

                    mind bland and mind shields are completly different, shields protect your mind while mind blank makes your mind totally immune to any interaction from mind magic (it can however be dispelled but dispelling is hard in combat)

                      yeah and shields/typical defences are basically useless against zorian, if you don't have your mind completely blanked and shut off, you're going to get pretty rekt. unless you're some whacked out lifeform like that worm lol

                        mind shields are described as "shells" they are basically a layer of something rigid protecting the mind, pretty much always with cracks and weak points that you can use to dismantle the defense, but generally a mind shield would give you enough time for you to beat Zorian, since he'd need to remove the shield, dismantling is cheap and time consuming, breaking is quick and expensive.

                        Mind blank is the immunity, but have the side effect that it drives the user insane if used too often, it's not a shield as much as it simply remove the mind from existance for anyone but the user, and since it does not exist nobody else can interact with it.

      I think he was between 5 and 6 years when they teamed up. From my notes which I made on some early read:

      * 1 month of not knowing he's in a loop
      * 6 full and a one very short iterations of sitting around doing nothing and wondering when the repetition will end
      * 1 month with Zack there
      * 6 months of improving himself, trying to impress Ilsa and Xvim
      * an unknown but large number of 3-5 day iterations
      * 1 month where Kirielle comes along
      * 6 months where he's trying not to draw any attention because Zach's around and he's afraid of soul bonds
      * 11 months of learning from the Aranea in Cyoria
      * a very quickly ending iteration where he suicides to escape RR
      * 22 months of staying away from Cyoria (minus 10 days)
      * 9 more months before he teams up with Zack

      So that's 63 months plus however long he spent in short iterations.

  Does anyone else get the impression that Neolu is an empath?

  We've been told that empathy allows a person to make more sense of divination spells, so that would fit her bloodline as described.

  Plus:
  >Zorian gave her a speculative look. The way she phrased her statement gave the impression she trusted a mere hunch about their good character to keep her safe, but the surety in her voice made Zorian think there some something a lot more concrete involved there. Perhaps something… divination-based?

  - u/Banarok:
    ```
    problem with that is that Zorian would instantly know if she was an empath, simply because since he "opened" his mind he've "seen" & "felt" minds around him and other psychics appears as "suns" compared to the "dim" flickerminds.

    so he's recognize an empath by just switching on his mind sense, something he does ALL the time.
    ```

    - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:

      So a fake empath then? Those "eyes" on her face could be permanent divination spells, checking for the feelings of people around her and relaying it into her mind. Zorian wouldn't detect it, because it isn't a "mind" doing the empathic sensing.

  How exactly do these imperial artifacts work? Do they have to collect them each loop or do they somehow loop with them? They seem to have the orb in every restart these days, but maybe that's just because they've gotten really good at taking it?
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    They have to collect every artifact in a single restart in order to unbar the gate. They've simply gotten good enough at getting the orb that it's not mentioned in the story. They're not going for every artifact at once because they want to spend the time to optimize getting each artifact individually before trying to do everything at once.  Also, if the artifacts give some extremely useful ability aside from the time loop related one, it could make getting the other artifacts easier, so it makes sense to get really good at obtaining each individual artifact and understanding it before putting huge resources into going for the others. For example, I imagine the crown would make getting the dagger much easier because depending on whether it gives flat or percentage Mana storage, Zach could have even more mana or Zorian could have nearly as much as Zach does now.
    ```

    - u/Zorian42:
      ```
      > For example, I imagine the crown would make getting the dagger much easier (...)

      If you mean the ring, then I agree. It means being able to fight for longer time. But the dagger is in the royal vault, and last time they tried it, the problem was their (lack of good) ward breaking/divination spells, I don't really think mana would help with that.

      > depending on whether it gives flat or percentage Mana storage, Zach could have even more mana or Zorian could have nearly as much as Zach does now.

      From what we know, Zach and QI have the same base mana, so either way Zach would get 10x mana from wearing the crown (just the mana, not mana regeneration).

      If the crown mana storage is flat, it would hold ~2250 magic missiles (QI has ~250 without crown, with crown it's 10 times larger). Last intel we have on Zorian (before he was casting invisible missiles) is being able to cast 35 magic missiles.

      So if the bonus is flat, Zorian would get +2250, which means ((2250+35)/35) = ~65 times as much max mana as he has now.
      If the bonus is percentage, Zorian will get +315 max mana (10 times as much as he has now).

      (Of course all of these numbers are based on magic missiles that Zorian can (probably) cast better than either QI or Zach.)

      One thing the crown doesn't change is mana regeneration rate, so it 'only' helps at the first part of the battle, if the battle's too long, the crown's usefulness disappears.

      btw If they manage to get the crown reliably + early in each restart + decide to give it to Zorian, maybe he should start learning different spells - right now, even though he knows the more expensive spells, he is more focused on cheaper spells => trained them more == has better efficiency in them. He mentioned many times through the story that he doesn't care about the more expensive spells.

        No, I mean the crown. Yes, Zorian isn't going to suddenly be able to batter down the vault doors, but it will almost certainly devolve to a fight at some point, and more Mana will help with that.

        I mean, yes, the extra Mana will probably help with the dagger the least of the artifacts, but we don't know anything about the defences around the staff, the orb is apparently almost trivial to get now, and the crown obviously can't help getting the crown. I suppose the crown helps with getting the ring if they choose to follow the same method of getting it again, but I think the difference in skill/difficulty between getting the ring at all and getting it easily is less than not getting it and barely getting it. Also I wasn't thinking of that example, which is honestly the much bigger factor.

        > One thing the crown doesn't change is mana regeneration rate, so it 'only' helps at the first part of the battle, if the battle's too long, the crown's usefulness disappears.

        Thank you for the math. 

        It would have to be a rather long battle for Zorian to spend 65 times his normal base, even if gets more wasteful as a result of his Max storage being higher.

        It would also take a looong time for Zorian to fill up the crown. I think that a normal mage can go from nothing to full in about half an hour, provided there's sufficient ambient Mana? ~33 hours of continuous Mana generation, and that's only if he spends none of his Mana. He'd also have to take time for sleep.

        If the crown grants temporary loop markers, just give one to a royal or someone with access to the royal vault.  After they see the invasion for themselves and learn that ZZ can stop it but need the dagger from the vault, they can just remove it from the vault without triggering all the wards and deliver it to ZZ at the beginning of the next few loops.  No need to breach the vault at all, just bypass all those wards instead.

        Of course getting the crown is another matter.

  I'm starting to think that the Crown's special function has nothing to do with markers, and instead just gives (effectively) infinite mana.

  Dagger kills dudes -> Dagger's secret function kills dudes across resets.    
  Orb stores things -> Orb's secret function stores things across resets.  
  Crown stores mana -> Crown's secret function stores mana across resets.

      They don't actually do that, Zorian just brings notebooks over,  he can make memory packets but I don't think he can just overwrite other people's memories with them.

      Although now that I think about it that could be worth researching: making memory packets (which are huge) and storing them in the orb, then somehow research how to forcefully overwrite people's memories with them.

      It probably can't be done but it would be worth researching the limits.

      - u/Omniada:
        ```
        He wouldn't need to store them in the orb, he maintains memory packets in his mind across the reset - e.g. the matriarch's. They're also, as far as I can tell, not physical things, so there wouldn't really be anything to store in the orb. The only issue would be if they're really big he might be unable to fit more than a few in. Maybe just go with storing a memory patch?
        ```

        - u/JiggyRobot:
          ```
          The matriarch stored a memory packet in Zorians head but she was the one that had to unpack it. It seems like a person has to create/unpack a memory packet themselves (Zorian cannot do it for another person).

          Also, the memories don't need to be physical things. One of the orbs uses has been stated to be an ability to store memories across restarts.
          ```

        - u/MaddoScientisto:
          ```
          It was established that memory packets are really big (Zorian could carry very few notebooks while he still had the matriarch packet) and that the orb can carry memory stuff, which makes it perfect to hold a bunch of full memory dumps of people.

          The question that wasn't explored so far is if memory packets can actually be overwritten over actual people, so far we only saw them compared to very big books but for memories and they have to be "digested"

            When did it say this? I remember the spider's memory packet was huge, but that could be because of all the crazy mind things she was doing. Remember, this spider was using some kind of parallel processing to receive the inputs of ALL the spiders in her colony at the same time. That one memory packet of hers probably contains the memories of the ENTIRE colony.

  This cycle they had some issues with ship stealing/warding scheme so they had to fight the pursuit team. the next restart they will be able getaway perfectly and fly to Blantyrre straight away to find the staff. And I won't be surprised that Neolu will be key to identifying the staff location. They will be bringing Neolu to another continent (why not bring the adventurous girl) and due to her divination bloodline she might narrow the location.

    They are going to live (at least plan to) happily ever after.
