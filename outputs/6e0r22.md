  I am depressed about politics again and hate how much hatred I have allowed myself to feel towards my political opponents. It's not even Trump that gets to me anymore, it's the fact that his supporters and allies continuously fail to question his competence or admit his failures. The White House didn't even deny the $2 trillion accounting error in the budget proposal and people are still backing it.

  I hate this so much that I worry that I may become a hypocrite towards my belief that all humans deserve equal rights and all suffering should be prevented. I care less and less about these people who proudly choose to follow a path that will harm themselves and others, so I'm worried that I wouldn't be willing to aid someone or prevent them from suffering purely because they disagree with my political views.

  I don't want to be that kind of person. I used to identify as a centrist because I was worried about bias from both parties, but now I fear one party so much that I'm allowing myself to feel bias against anyone who voted differently from me and doesn't regret it. I want to be the kind of person who's better than that, someone who feels compassion towards everyone and does not compromise their views.

  This is kind of an alien idea for me since I've always hated stories about revenge. I don't feel catharsis from seeing evil people get punished, just stopped from inflicting more harm. Except...part of me would be okay if the people I hate suffer and I'm not adamantly rejecting these thoughts as strongly as I used to. I just know on a detached intellectual level that such a course of action won't make me happy and won't make the situation better.

      What does it mean that I already knew this and used to it give both myself and others hope for the future after the election, only to end up in the situation I am now. I used to be able to love the people I hated because I loved humanity in all our flaws, but now I don't know if I can do that anymore. I don't want to believe that past me was naive, I despise my newfound cynicism and the fact that I'm not sticking to the philosophy I chose to follow in spite of it.

    Understandable. But consider - there are sane viewpoints that agree with *everything* that you think about Trump and *still* would defend a vote for him.

    The simplest and most straightforward of these viewpoints is the idea that Trump is not significantly worse than any other politician - he is merely worse at hiding his transgressions. This point of view relies on the idea that *any* President would be as bad, but at least with this one everyone can *see* how bad he is and work on mitigating the problems.

    The second possible viewpoint is the single-issue voter - a person who thinks that one single issue is *so important* that Trump's support for it (and his opponent's lack of support for it) is so incredibly vital that it outweighs all of his problems.

    Mind you, I'm not saying that either of these are necessarily in any way right. I am simply presenting these as positions that sane people can hold.

    (Personally, as someone who doesn't live in America, I have no say in your voting; but I think your entire electoral system is broken and needs some serious revision).

      Most of the other candidates were not going to retroactively pull the USA out of the Paris agreement on climate-change.  Climate change is not an ephemeral policy matter; it is life and death.

        Past American presidents have (to the best of my knowledge) *still* not ratified the Kyoto Accords, which are supposed to limit climate-change-causing pollutants.

        So, America being kind of iffy on climate change is by no means unique to Trump.

          Speaking from Australia, there's a big difference between not-ratifying Kyoto and pulling out of Paris, the landmark agreement that the USA and China pulled together.  Kyoto was basically a joke; ditching Paris will *murder* US diplomacy for as long as Trump or his appointees hold power - they just can't be trusted.

          Sure, it's not unique.  It's part of a pattern: a Democratic administration negotiates and signs onto a major international treaty, and then an incoming Republican Presidency and Senate pull out of it.

          Climate change *remains* life and death.  The atmosphere isn't going to warm any less to engage charitably with the Republican point-of-view.  Nature doesn't care what philosophies make sense to readers of the *National Review* or West Virginian coal miners hoping Trump will bring back their jobs -- let alone weirdos like [Jason Jorjani](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/03/jason-reza-jorjani-stony-brook-alt-right-arktos-continental-philosophy-modernity-enlightenment/).

    we all have limited time and energy, and that cuts us off from some possibilities, especially when there are people actively working against us, including the recently elected political regime. there is nothing wrong with pushing that suffering onto the people causing it in the first place in order to help the people they would try to hurt, even if the only reason to do so is so that you have more to help others with. it is a difficult decision to make, but it is the rational thing to do.

    I've been through this myself, and I've decided that recognizing that I hate these people (and more so, that hatred is the only emotion appropriate to feel for monsters of great magnitude) is not a moral failing of myself, but simply accepting a fact. I tried very hard not to hate them, to make excuses, to see whatever shreds of worth they might have, but ultimately I failed.

    These people are objectively wrong about every single thing they believe. There isn't a single position they hold where they can be said to be morally or factually correct. All of their ideas tend towards maximizing human suffering. My realization is that I should not hate myself for believing that.

    At first, this felt horrible. Like I had compromised something precious that I could not get back. But that didn't change the fact that I hate these people. I can recognize this fact about myself, accept it, and move on.

    It is a sad fact about our world that sometimes you are forced to behead all of the blood purists. That no matter your convictions, evil people must be prevented from ever holding a shred of power, no matter the cost in misery or broken faith.

    Don't beat yourself up about this. It doesn't make you a horrible person if you hate horrible people. It just makes you a human.

      I agree with the spirit of what you're trying to say, but I think you're taking it to an extreme. It's okay to acknowledge that political opponents are wrong, that their desired outcomes will be a net negative, that their values are harmful to your values.  It's incorrect to say that they're literally wrong about every single thing.

      Out of curiosity, do you believe they are the way they are because of their upbringing, or because of biological factors inherent to them?

      That is impressive. You should ask them what 1+1 is. If they don't answer 2, I'll concede to you on this point.

      > It is a sad fact about our world that sometimes you are forced to behead all of the blood purists. That no matter your convictions, evil people must be prevented from ever holding a shred of power, no matter the cost in misery or broken faith.

      The problem is that that is the exact logic that leads people to do evil things (like kill all the horrible Jews who are oppressing the Germans, or kill all the horrible kulaks, and so on). Just because you feel very confident that someone is evil doesn't mean you're right and doesn't mean you can't become more evil than them.

  Starting to see where Eliezer's opinion on politics as the mind-killer comes from. 

  Everyone is talking in circles about their hatred for the current US government - yet no one seems to be discussing how to actually fix things.

  There really are only two opinions: 

   1. It's impossible to fix.
   2. It isn't. 

  If you earnestly believe (1) then why bother bringing it up? It'd be like ranting about gravity.

  If you believe (2) then you should be discussing how to attack the problem. Ranting about it just wastes time at best and helps the target of your hatred at worst - I suspect Trump's victory is in part because of the brand recognition received by people mocking him.

  Alternatively if you're not going to attempt to fix the problem, then this must be for the sake of catharsis. If that's the case, you're going about this the wrong way.

  News spreads because it seems important and controversial in the moment. But that gives you a method for dealing with it, just step back and assess how important it really is. You wont feel so hot blooded if you wait a month before peeking at the shenanigans of government.

  Sorry if this has been overly confrontational, but we're supposed to a community of aspiring rationalists.

  In other news my GP has prescribed me antidepressants - specifically escitalopram. Anyone got any on the ground experience they could offer?
  ```

  - u/Imperialgecko:
    ```
    I think a lot of people feel that they're incapable of influencing large-scale politics and so just take a back seat. Not exactly the best approach but I can understand it.


    I don't know about those specific antidepressants, but I do have unwanted advice in general about them. The biggest thing that I see incredibly smart people fall for is the idea that now that they feel better, they don't need the medicine anymore. I think it's better to look at it as something that improves your life in a positive way, and something that you should get used to having for the rest of your life, even with the common stigmas people have about mental ilnesses and medicine.

    Completely unwarranted advice but I just felt compelled to say that after seeing it happen so often. Hope that the medicine works well for you, depression is a bitch.
    ```

    - u/ZeroNihilist:
      ```
      I second the importance of continuing the medication, but it's worth noting that it is sometimes (often?) possible to reduce and eventually discontinue the dosage.

      The crucial thing is that you follow medical advice (i.e. ask your doctor before altering your dosage), and that you carefully monitor yourself for signs of depression or suicidal ideation until you're stable (for at least a month after you've ceased intake, preferably 6 months), and to inform your psychiatrist/GP if 

      I'm not on escitalopram, so I don't have any specific advice. In a general sense, depression medication is at least partially a stop-gap measure. Whether you're experiencing suicidal thoughts or not, depression impinges on your ability to live your life. This is, obviously, a bad thing. Medication may not cure you in the short term, but it should allow you to regain more ability to function.

      This is an important concept. The thing that will ultimately cure your depression is you, whether it's through lifestyle change, cognitive behavioural therapy, or even continued use of medication. Medication is what allows you to get to that point.

      There may be side effects, and that's one reason why the end goal is usually to discontinue the medication if it's safe to do so. Make sure you know what side effects escitalopram can cause, and notify your doctor if more serious ones occur.

      It's like any other prescription, really. If you had epilepsy, would you stop taking the medication that helped control it just because you hadn't had a seizure in a while? Hopefully not, but you might be able to stop it if your doctor agreed that a non-medication treatment plan would be sufficient (and, it bears repeating, you'd monitor your health and tell them if you relapsed).

      **TL;DR:** Depression is an actual illness that needs to be treated. Medication is often a key component of that treatment, either temporarily or indefinitely. Don't ignore the treatment plan just because your disease is neurological.

    My partner is on a high dose of escitalopram. Like most SSRIs, it is very likely to interfere with your bedroom function (the equipment still works OK, but getting to completion is an issue). 

    In terms of doing "what it's meant to", he seems pretty happy with it. He's gained a lot of weight since he was on it though, and sleeps almost all day (he's got a script for modafinil that he takes daily, and he will still regularly sleep 2-6 hours during the day). He also has sleep apnoea which can't help.

    But he's on a big dosage (40mg/day) so you may not have such a hard time with it depending on how much you're getting. Another friend's on it and they only take 10mg a day. Partner has severe OCD so he needs a higher dose than someone with depression does.
