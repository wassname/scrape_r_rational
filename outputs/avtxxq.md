## What tracker do you guys use?

### Post:

I need something to notify me when the stories I read update. What do you guys use?

Edit: For stories not on Patreon/SB/SV

  I often just use /r/rational to be honest, most of the updates to stories I like come through here.
  ```

  I'm gonna be obvious here but: Most webnovel repositories have mail alert features.

  For those stories that aren't published on a repo, there may be an RSS feed. If there's no feed, you may try asking for one.

  Although to be honest I've long since decided to just _not_ follow webnovels that I can't manage in Calibre (through FanFicFare with mail alerts). There's just too many stories from too many sources and I have to filter them _somehow_ or I'll lose my mind. That means no blogs, no custom sites, no non-threadmarked forums posts.
  ```

    ```
    Just to add on: when there's a feed but no email list, I personally use blogtrottr.com . Also +tags in my email address so all my updates are easily filtered.
    ```

  This isn't for everyone, but for the stories I really care about (WtC, MoL) I support them on Patreon. For those two at least the authors post when they upload a new chapter.

  (I'm sure someone will come along with a better direct answer to your question.)

    Oh for those yes. I just meant for stories that aren't updated on Patreon/Spacebattles/SufficientVelocity
    ```

  For anything with an RSS feed, IFTTT + Pocket works great.
  ```

- u/Arancaytar:
  ```
  For Practical Guide to Evil, I used to use Feedhuddler until it shut down, and now I use an IFTTT applet. Most stories (eg. all that use Wordpress) have an RSS feed, so that might be worth checking out.

  (For me, Pocket makes particular sense because it can sync to an e-reader, but there are other ways to use it as well.)

  I use [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) as an RSS aggregator. In general, if you want to be notified when one of several streams of content updates, RSS feeds are the most straightforward solution that isn't tied to a platform like Facebook/Twitter/whatever. They're emitted by Wordpress blogs, most webcomics, Reddit and even Youtube if you search a little (not Archive of our Own, unfortunately).

  Honestly, I'd say any feed aggregator is as good as any other. Inoreader has a good UI, decent features in the free version, no major drawback and mostly does everything you'd expect it to do.

  I hit the “subscribe” button, or use an RSS feed when that isn’t available.
  ```

- u/EthanCC:
  ```
  Most sites have an RSS feed.

- u/archpawn:
  ```
  I've been using mail for stories and anything else where that's an option. I also use feedly.com for RSS feeds.
  ```

- u/TBestIG:
  ```
  I don’t use one. I have 46 tabs open on my phone
  ```

  - u/SkyTroupe:
    ```
    I relate to this on a spiritual level
    ```
