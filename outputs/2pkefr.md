  I can almost hear the "*What are you doing you idiot child*" from Malfoy after that last line... I'm not certain I disagree with it either, that seems like a risky gambit.

      This still reminds me of times when I realized I just lost a game of chess: I would try to strike an immediate victory, however futile. Though since the fic is somewhat railroaded, it might not matter. (Not that I really mind - it is still an enjoyable read).

    He's pulling a Doctor.

      ```
      The Doctor has used a lot of crazy strategies... which one are you referring to?  The "I surrender so now you can monologue and tell me all your strategies and intentions" strategy?  The "let me desperately beg for peace while also setting up a hidden plot" strategy?  Or the common "hijack control of everything leveraging the local ~~technology~~ magic and his ~~sonic screw driver~~ wand along with the [~~applied phlebotinum~~](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum) [magic](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagicAIsMagicA) of the current ~~episode~~ plot-arc" strategy?

        You've summed up the re-boot of Doctor Who quite nicely.

          I've never seen classic who, so this is all I know.  I do like the show, in spite of, or perhaps because I find the plots predictable.  There is something fun about it, even when it is clearly into the fantasy side of fantasy sci-fi and I can see the plot twists within the first 15 minutes.
          ```

            Classic Who lasted for decades so it's quite a mix but overall the plots and characterisations are less well developed AND the pace was much slower. BUT it was great at the time and definitely still fun fantasy sci-fi.
            ```

        ```
        Pretty much all of the above.
        ```

    ```
    Risky compared to what? Where was the *safe* course for Harry to take, assuming he did NOT want a wizard-Muggle war, or a wizard tyranny over Muggles?

  Sure it was worth it to teach Harry losing :)

  Now Riddle has to "write off" Harry as lost investment (because he lost all credibility in wizards world).
  ```

- u/JackStargazer:
  ```
  While surrender could be a viable option if it was conditional, surrender in name only perhaps, unconditional surrender is not going to go over very well. 

  I feel like there is going to be exposition in the next chapter that perhaps makes this seem a better option than it does now. Though I feel that sort of defeats the purpose of a rational story - in that we are supposed to have access to the same information as Harry (in general) so we can follow his thought processes.

  I don't know about the rest of you, but this doesn't seem like a great idea to me. Even if he is just doing this as a big middle finger to Quirrel, I think we've got enough evidence now that any blatant confrontation of Quirrell is a **really freaking bad idea**.
  ```

  ```
  I think I've found a world in which Harry's gambit makes sense.

  Next Chapter:

  > "Of course," said Harry, "a large majority vote by the wizarding equivelant of the house of lords can overturn my decision and dissolve our treaty. So this is your oppurtunity to win them over. I know these people and can offer advice, but ultimately, what you offer them for their surrender is up to you. What, your majesty, would become of magical Britain under your rule?"

  In this way Harry puts himself in the "Us" category in parliments "Us against Them" view, but still manages to get a fair deal for wizards, since the Queen is likely to offer *more* than she otherwise would have as she now has no idea of how much she needs to give up to ensure peace and giving more than she could have is safer than giving potentially too little (in addition, she only has one shot at it, as opposed to the ability to negotiate that she would have had dealing with Harry).
  ```
