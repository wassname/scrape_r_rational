  Sometimes the problem with a serial installment is fitting in everything you need to have happen before the next good stopping point--this one is *long*.
  Some old references from Fall; readers might have a bit of apprehension about Speedtest, and we get to see how bad Flicker's morning wake up routine used to be.
  I may write a pulp style story about Luce Cannon and Belle Tinker sometime, the characters are too good to just leave as history.
  Belle Tinker's inventions are best visualized as being drawn by Jack Kirby.

    Ah, now we get to get (understand) the title.

      Took me a lot longer to get here than I expected 8-)  Trickiest part was reconciling the timing of a number of events already established in backstory with little things like "Why hasn't Doc read the book as of Fall?  No, really, he's the smartest man in the world and he was paying attention."  Not quite done with the answer to that 8-)

        I had to go back and look for [why the Volunteer hadn't brought it up with doc](https://docfuture.tumblr.com/post/58487425866/hunt).  Between the way he locked it down and what he didn't say, and probably won't in the future, when inspiring Stella I look forward to when Black Swan or Golden Valkyrie really explain what happened there.

          Yeah, I had to reread that scene very carefully a couple of times to be sure what would fit (I already made one historical mistake there--The Prince was written in vernacular Italian instead of Latin)  I haven't decided yet just how mangled/incomplete the version of PPD that the Volunteer put in the Database was, so I still have some wiggle room for future plot-fitting 8-)

    I love the book!

      Writing within a lot of established continuity can be a lot of extra work, but the ability to expand on what was originally a throwaway detail to solve a characterization problem in Fall was a lot of fun.

  ```
  It's really interesting how quickly all of the big events happened, temporally speaking. The princess, flicks fallout with journeyman, the speed test, journeyman's disastrous romance/infiltration.
  ```

    Timing and pacing are tricky when putting together backstory like this. And there are solid narrative reasons as well. To quote the narrator in William Messner-Loebs "Journey":

    "In the wilderness, a feller could go for months without a thing happening either singular or unusual. Then ten things would come in a rush, like frightened geese after a rifle crack...And generally, they was all bad..."
    8-)
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Wait. *Rational romance?!* It's *actually happening*!? I applaud you sir.
  ```

  - u/FordEngineerman:
    ```
    But canonically it doesn't happen and Flicker is left traumatized by this experience for years. This is a prequel after all.
    ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Romance doesn't have to *succeed* for it to have happened...
      ```

      - u/DocFuture:
        ```
        Indeed. Without getting too spoilery, I'll note that the most consistent way to read the current serialized version of what Flicker tells Doc in Call is 'Story told to parent that is consistent with the facts he knows'. On the other hand, 'Princess' is *not* a romance in the genre sense, it's a Bildungsroman with a touch of mirrors for princes. This is important for reader expectations.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Of course. Of course we are also as readers entitled to our own headcanons and interpretations :) and perhaps it's a good thing that stories are not real life.

          It may sound obvious, but obvious things often bear repeating. :)

          You're writing a great story. Keep it up.
          ```

        - u/FordEngineerman:
          ```
          I think eventually you should edit Call because that description doesn't really make sense to me. Why would she tell Doc a worse and more damning version of the events that makes her look bad and super creepy and immature? The truth is so much less bad than what she said unless there is more to come in this current short.
          ```

          - u/DocFuture:
            ```
            There is more to come, and I already plan to edit Call for the book version. Unfortunately, progressive changes in the Tumblr editor make it very risky for me to make changes in individual chapters that are more than a few years old (and reposting the whole chapter has a problem with breaking the links from the previous and next chapters, which would also have to be edited...)
            ```
