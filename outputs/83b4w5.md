## Request: Rational Story With Dragon Protagonist

### Post:

I've been looking all over, but haven't found any stories that are both rational and also have a dragon as the main character. I've started writing one in my spare time out of frustration. If anyone can point me to a story that meets the requirements, I'd be extremely grateful.

  I wouldn't say they are rational, but they are good stories that involve a dragon as a main character.

  [Alone Together](https://archiveofourown.org/works/3177607/chapters/6902765) - During the Triwizarding Tournament, Harry is teleported into the world of Temeraire bonded to a Horntail. It's a great crossover and indirectly fulfills your dragon protagonist request.

  [Sheen](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1810858/chapters/3886108) - Harry and Luna (who is now a dragon) decide to go exploring in Temeraire.

  [Dragon Lord](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5894467/chapters/13586929) - Smaug and Bilbo work together to destroy the One Ring.

  [Always be the Dragon](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/always-be-the-dragon-hs-dxd.348354/) - Some foolish cultists attempt to summon a dragon from a sacred gear and die in the process while the dragon merges with a girl. It's about a dragon freed from centuries of imprisonment trying to adapt to human society in Highschool DxD.

  [I Am Fire, I am Death; or Why My Stannis Is The Best Human](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/i-am-fire-i-am-death-or-why-my-stannis-is-the-best-human-%E2%80%93-asoiaf-si.389399/) - A dragon is born into the world of Game of Thrones and is raised by Stannis.

  [Not Your Saint George](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11982540/1/) - An AU of RWBY where Pyrrha is a dragon in a romance with bard Jaune.

  *disclaimer: This series is in Russian.*

  It has been quite a while since Iâ€™ve read it, but if I remember correctly [*Ð¡Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð¾ Ð¾ Ð´Ñ€Ð°ÐºÐ¾Ð½Ðµ* by ÐŸÐ°Ð²ÐµÐ» Ð¨ÑƒÐ¼Ð¸Ð»](http://fan.lib.ru/s/shumil_p/) (~550k words total) should either be rational or at least not have too many disqualifying bad writing tropes.

  *(spoilers)*

  It had technological uplift, colonisation of new planets, interdimensional travel (I think), some worldbuilding regarding the nature of the dragon species, etc.

  The protag of the first set of books is somewhat MarySue-ish.

    Thanks for the recommendation, I gave it a try, and it's not bad. 

    It has grim darkness of Dark Ages with all the gory social mores, a dragon protagonist that tries to do the right thing in a smart way, and awesome moments like [minor spoiler](#s "hedgehogs hiding in a fir tree"), but it also has some strange moments like [spoilers](#s "dragon never learning to wear armor and use vehicles for transport, dragon having a minor cause of major brain damage, characters proudly holding idiot ball, scope insensitivity problems, failure to achieve technological superiority, etc. The most egregious failure is not using the Cure For Death after it was proven to work. Why the hell doesn't protagonist grow spare body for himself and the most valuable people and institute a practice of regular brain backups? He has the technology now.")

    In my opinion, it qualifies as a rational story (with some caveats), but not really as a rationalist one, because protagonist consistently fails to see applications for technology he possesses and to learn from his mistakes.

    Oh, and I personally found female characters to be somewhat insane, and protagonist as well.

  The protagonist is not a dragon but you might enjoy the Temeraire series as highly intelligent but decidedly inhuman dragons play a key role. I personally think that the characterization of the dragons in this series is the best part as it is executed exceptionally well but does not overshadow the main plot.

  The series is not marketed as an explicitly "rational" series but I believe that the world and characters created in this series meet most of the needed criteria.

      Temeraire is the best Dragon. I love the way he's more human than the other dragons, but not quite human either. It's hilarious how he's a book-wyrm of sorts as well.

          Yea I couldn't find any good temeraire ones. I really hope they make a good movie adaptation, though it'll need a pretty high budget.

  You'll have to wait for the dragon to show up in Worth the Candle.

    Has this actually been hinted by the author, or is this a joke? The only mention I've seen is in one of the recent chapters, where dragons are mentioned as incredibly powerful (and very protective of airspace.) Seems like a little op for a party member, at least until Joon levels a lot.

      As I recall, he remarks that he knows he'll eventually face a dragon. And, really, why wouldn't he? He's playing Dungeons and Dragons. And he's already been in a dungeon.

  There was a parable about the use of capital where a dragon was either a imperial treasurer or a tycoon, who either way had his hoard made up of deeds for productive companies, that I was looking for recently.  I haven't found it after more than a half hour later night/early morning googling, but I'm pretty sure it was posted here or on r/HPMOR within the last 5 years.

  Unfortunately, that's a really niche genre of writing. Xenofiction is probably more likely to be rational than most genres, but specifying dragons doesn't give you a lot of a shot.

  But hey, I'd love to be proven wrong.

  I'm assuming this is a horrible recommendation since it has been several decades since I read it, but black wing in the Dragonlance universe is from the perspective of - if not rational then at least selfishly motivated - evil dragons.

- u/knite:
  ```
  Haven't read it and may not be rational, but have heard good things about [Tooth and Claw](https://www.amazon.com/Tooth-Claw-Jo-Walton/dp/0765319519).

- u/Dreamliss:
  ```
  Have your read [Dragon Champion](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632579.Dragon_Champion) by E.E. Knight? It's been a while since I read it, so I don't remember how rational it is, but the main character is a dragon. There are six books in the series right now.

  It doesn't fit your request as well and it's been much much longer since I've read them, but the [Dragonriders of Pern](https://www.goodreads.com/series/50060-pern-publication-order) books by Anne McCaffrey has many dragons in it, bonded to the protagonists. I can't recall if any of the books are from the perspective of the dragons directly though.

      Ah I'd hoped those suggestions would be new to you. I read a lot and love books with dragons, I was wracking my brain but that's all I could come up with (that wasn't already suggested by others). You're right, there really isn't a lot out there from the POV of dragons...
      ```

- u/None:
  ```
  I'm... *very* technically preparing to write one. If you want a character that's physically a dragon, then I can assure you: my story isn't going to satisfy. Else, I could send a PM whenever it begins publication.

  Have you looked at any My Little Pony fanfiction? One of the main characters (Spike) is a dragon so there could be stories about him which happens to be rational.

  You could try Sythyry's Journal. It's about a small dragon (a foot or two tall) who becomes a wizard.
