  First off, the hero should not be Timmy. Timmy is terrifying. Timmy is an immature pre-teen boy with control of the most powerful technology in existence. (In-world)

  I'm not the most familiar with the series, but if this were the writing prompt I were working with, Crocker would be the main protagonist. In a more rational Fairly Odd-Parents world, he may just be the only thing between Timmy and global destruction.

  All it takes is one screwup to kill the entire human race, or worse. Crocker will have his hands full just preventing Timmy from blowing up the world or breaking the laws of thermodynamics, let alone getting wish technology for himself.

  Timmy is terrifying without even considering how the kid manages to weasel around "Da Rules", with such efficiency he might as well be a munchkin in disguise. He outright breaks them a lot of the time, AND THEN MAKES IT WORK ANYWAY.

  An ordinary(ish) middle-aged teacher versus a volatile ten-year-old kid with potential world destroying abilities? That's a scary story. 

  (For added rationality, it could be Crocker's goal to utilize wish technology to benefit the species, rather than his usual shtick.)

  There are quite a lot of [rules](http://fairlyoddparents.wikia.com/wiki/Da_Rules).

  Rational!Timmy:
  Timmy walked into his room and saw Cosmo and Wanda waiting for him. "Timmy it's your one year anniversary since you got us, which means you get a rule free magic muffin." "Anything?" Timmy asked to clarify. "Yes anything" said Cosmo and Wanda exchanging worried looks. "Alright", said Timmy with a mischevious grin. He took a bite out of the magic muffin and said "I wish for the ability to make unrestricted wishes similiar to those allowed by the magic muffin at any time I want, either by writing them down, speaking them, or thinking them." Wanda and Cosmo stared in horror at the god in front of them. Timmy then wished for omnipotence, invulnerability, and omniscience. THE END

  ```
  Fundamentally broken, unless you vastly reconfigure the story to the point where it's unrecognizable. The story will end in five minutes, either with the death of all of humanity or the dissolution of most of humanity's problems.
  ```

- u/Timewinders:
  ```
  This would be amusing to read. I imagine you would have to make the rules a bit stricter than in canon for the protagonist to not immediately break the story. Alternatively, you could make Norm the genie with his unrestricted godlike magic the antagonist as he chooses human wish askers who he can easily manipulate. That might end up breaking the story the other way though. Both parties would be undoing each others' wishes as fast as possible, assuming they can't just wish each other's magic away, until one or both set up some kind of automatically granting wish like "I wish all of Norm's wishes were undone right after they were granted" or something.

  ```
  Are the Fairies smart enough to not assign Fairy Godparents to a child who is being tortured specifically so they will qualify for Fairy Godparents? All it takes is a tiny information leak for someone to realize that they can build Omelas.

    ```
    > Are the fairies smart enough

    No.

    Case in point: Cosmo is allowed to wield nigh omnipotent magic.

  ```
  It's too broken :O Great picture though.
  ```

- u/_brightwing:
  ```
  There can only be one explanation. Timmy is an uploaded mind and the world is a simulation. The (imperfect) system is set to keep him in check, while keeping him entertained and satisfying his values the best way it deems. 

  The God!Timmy concept has so much potential.. The only other story that I read that tackled this idea was [Daddyâ€™s World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2059690.Daddy_s_World). Not a recommended read though. They really could have handled the A.I. part better.
