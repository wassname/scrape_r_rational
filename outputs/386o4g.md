## [D] What to do with a free energy device?

### Post:

Suppose that, in the otherwise unchanged modern day, you have uncovered an obscure principle allowing for free energy without any obvious implications for other applications.  The technology has the following attributes:

* Each generator is relatively cheap to produce in the current economy, perhaps a bit more expensive than a similarly-sized gas motor.  The prices of required components may skyrocket if it becomes clear what they may be used for, though.
* No external fuel is consumed in operation.  Maintenance costs are basically nonexistent.  Barring external damage, an activated generator will run about a millennium without human input.
* The first generation of the technology puts out 0.25 watts/m^3.  You expect that further research and development will exponentially increase the power output per volume until some unknown, far-off conceptual limit is hit, similar to the development of faster and more information-dense computers.

You are the only individual on the planet who's aware of this discovery.  How do you wield this asset to fulfill your values?

  I'd plaster everything I know about this device all over the web. I'm not smart enough to make the best possible use of this technology on my own but I'm highly likely to benefit from hundreds of very smart people all over the world suddenly having access to free energy.

    Basically this. I'm not particularly interested in money, though of course having more to donate would not be a bad thing. I'd do some thinking first and ask suitably smart and trustworthy people, but it feels like giving it to a single actor, corporation or whatnot, is probably not going to be very efficient at improving the quality of life of as many people as possible.

    In addition, in a case where something like this is discovered, I am highly more likely to be one of the people who don't discover it rather than the one who does, and so in that position I would most likely wish for whoever is in the position to make this decision to choose to open source it.

    I would like to point out that you were smart enough to come up with the idea.  That makes me think that you might be smart enough to come up with other ideas.  Failing that, you're probably smart enough to go on a motivational speaking circuit to encourage others to do what you did.  Becoming wealthy would allow you to use your brains or your experience to encourage the development of others, even if you never have another good idea again.

      You're right, I had not considered the implication that having discovered this technology I must logically have a significant amount of knowledge not available to my current self. I had previously assumed a blueprints falling into my lap scenario.
      I still don't think I could justify putting limits on access to such a game changing technology, we're talking lives saved on a massive scale. There is no reason however I shouldn't make very clear my own role in this technology's development which has to be worth at least an exceptionally high paying job in a field I'm implicitly quite gifted in.

      Nope, being smart alone doesn't qualify you to organize or hold motivational speaking events, let alone actually motivate others. That's just the halo effect speaking. Plenty of geniuses were really ineloquent and had no charisma.

        I did say probably.  There are several levels of motivational speaking as well.  The skills required to speak motivationally to six-year-olds is different from what one would use to speak to career-established engineers.  Something that would bore me to tears might be thrilling to a high energy physicist.  Just explaining what you did, and how you did it could be enough for the right crowd.

        It is, however, possible that a person would be completely incapable of speaking directly to groups.  In that case, carefully scripted interviews would probably be possible.  Youtube is a wonderful thing sometimes :P

  I patent it, sell it to the highest bidder, and donate the proceeds to the best charity I can find. Want to hear about how I'd use other inventions?

    ```
    Highest bidder is a conglomerate of energy companies worried about being outcompeted, they buy it and put it under lock and key.

      lol, as if they wouldn't use it themselves. >:/

  - u/goocy:
    ```
    "Highest bidder" is only useful if you have the connections to find interested bidders. The homeless guy at my local parking lot could have a free energy device for all I know, but he's never going to sell it for more than a snack.
    ```

    - u/DCarrier:
      ```
      If you can prove you have a perpetual motion machine, the bidders will find you.

  Before doing anything like taking a loan to make the device or anything like that, I would visit a psychiatrist. Just in case.

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Best rational suggestion yet, but honestly the very first thing you should be doing is checking your instruments.
    ```

  - u/Farmerbob1:
    ```
    Actually, if we want to go the rational route, take a month or more to really dig deep.  Try and find evidence that someone has already investigated the discovery.  If you do find it, see where their idea differed from yours, and/or why they failed.  Then, with that information in hand, look at your own idea again.
    ```

  ```
  It's not really that economical from what people are saying, but it's nice to know I can stop the universe running down.  I start researching ways to spread out the resultant dent in spacetime from the added mass-energy to avoid an eventual Big Crunch/Spiral Nemesis.
  ```

  - u/LiteralHeadCannon:
    ```
    It's not really that economical *now*; but it's already apparent that its future progression will parallel the progression of computers.  In comparison to modern computers, the first computers seem stupidly inefficient.
    ```

- u/Farmerbob1:
  ```
  Much like DCarrier, I patent it in the United States only, reserve the right to distribute one license per year after the third year for free, and sell it.  If the sales price is ludicrous, I start donating part of my income stream to charity.

  Patenting it in the US only and reserving the right to donate one license per year after the third year will make sure the patent doesn't get bought and buried.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  First, take a loan, bribing officials to keep it quiet if necessary. Next, drain the market of the requisite parts. Release the plans online and and sell the the parts at a profit until the market begins to compensate and ramp up production. Alternatively, just buy a lot of stock in a company then sell them the design cheaply.

  For comparison, a solar panel (1m^2, 20% efficient, in Colorado) can produce enough to power a 50 watt lightbulb 24 hours/day 365 days/year, which provides a useful floor to how good the free energy machine has to be before it gets used for things.

  Let's say that it follows Moore's Law exactly, and doubles every 18 months.  It will take quite a while to be valuable as a product instead of as a technology.  In three years, it will reach 1W/m^3.  In another 9 years, it will reach 64W/m^3, still well below a solar panel + battery in a sunny climate, but kind of useful.  Another 7.5 years will have it at 1kW/m^3, and finally reaching the level of solar power for power density (assuming 1 m^3 = 20 m^2).  Almost 20 years after discovery, it finally has widespread commercial uses.

  Another 6 years, and it can beat gasoline generators (16kW/m^3), and then it can beat practically anything soon after that.
