  Not sure yet if it's going to be firmly RST, so I'm hedging my bets. 

  Two chapters right now, and it's doing pretty well. Two notable changes from canon: 

  [minor spoilers, first chapter]

  1) "[If your two hours run out then] the construct body will persist, as it is real and does not require power to maintain. But the pocket dimension will collapse, taking with it your true body and all of the computational hardware upon which your mind and memories are stored. You will simply cease to exist, leaving only the construct in your wake." 

  It appears that Tobias will not be getting trapped in bird morph. 

  2) "There are forces larger than any of us at work, and evidence that we have been maneuvered into place by those you might call God. I do not know the future, but I have seen its broader strokes, and can rank possibility far more finely than you would credit. This meeting was not by chance, and if there are few paths to victory, at least be assured that you walk upon the widest." 

  It appears that the Ellimist exists, or at least that the war has so many improbable elements that Elfangor suspects something of that nature to exist, and I would rank it as probable that high-ranking authorities, at least, also share in this belief of Elfangor's. 

  Which I think is *really interesting*, even more so than the bit about morphing. I have to wonder what it'd be like to look at the situation and realize that there's strong evidence that you and the other guys are being manipulated by a superintelligence whose motives you can only guess at.

    I'm not sure if you are the same person as the one who is posting *r Animorphs: The Reckoning* to fanfiction.net (WhatWouldEnderDo), but if you are, then I recommend taking a look at [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2bb0mo/ideas_for_rationalanimorphs/) where people on this subreddit previously discussed ideas for a rational!Animorph.

      Nope. But I let zem know that I've posted it here. The author mentions HPMOR and Worm in zir summary so I'm making an assumption that ze knows about r/Rational (I mentioned in a review that I had posted the fic here), but if the response I get back is "r/Rational, wuzzat?" then I'll make sure to drop that link in my next message.

    I'm wondering what's going to happen with Tobias.  I mean, that's kind of his *thing* from a narrative standpoint, being a nothlit. Do human minds screw with the tech enough to leave a sliver of a conduit open?  Does the Ellimist wave his hand and say "no, this is how it's going to be"? Does he get trapped and the Animorphs keep the hawk out of respect, only to find a way later to re-link the mind without restoring the form?

    On the other hand, assuming nothlits really don't exist, what does this mean for the Animorphs?  He's *going* to get shunted over to the other coast sooner or later, does that mean a second chapter of the Animorphs is going to get set up?  I'm really looking forward to how David is introduced (if he's introduced), that was one of the most terrifying trio of books in canon, and figuring out how to screen people is a definite must, and they *have* to do it sooner than 7/8ths of the way through the story.
    ```

      ```
      Something I just asked someone else: Who's going to volunteer to possibly sacrifice zemself for a chance at bringing back Elfangor? 

      Because if the original mind is still there, just suppressed by the morphing technology...
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        Somehow I doubt this would make it past the planning stages.  I mean, it seems like if that were possible the Andalite fleet would be made up of thousands of copies of their greatest warriors morphed from space-lizards or something barely sapient enough to do an accidental aquiring/morph.  Or even if not, you'd have self-deprecating arisths copying their War-Princes after a particularly depressing day, or all warriors could keep copies of *themselves* acquired from someone else's morph and thus restore 1:1 perfect backups after major injuries, which Elfangor obviously didn't do.

        I dunno, that seems like it would be a rabbit-hole of munchkinism if it turns out to be possible.  Nonetheless maybe *that's* Tobias' arc, I could totally see him doing it out of depression/desperation, though my personal guess is that since the acquiring happens at apparently a DNA level and not a full-body particle scan, you would not get memories or anything like that.  You'd have an infant Andalite (or worse, a brain-dead Andalite) stuck in an adult Elfangor's body.

  I loved the animorph series. I read all the books multiple times, especially the Chronicles books, since those were so good at depicting alien life.

  But I always hated that 2 hour morph limit. It sucked in so many ways, both Doyleistically and Wastonistically.

  From a Doyleist view, it's a crutch, there exclusively to offer the writer easy tension. So many times someone was stuck in a position where the timer was running down and they couldn't reset it because of reasons, that it just got silly.

  From a Watsonian point of view, it's even sillier. Why would a piece of alien technology for infiltration have a time limit measured in such neat round numbers, and wouldn't such a time limit be the first thing the engineers who made the device be working round the however-many-hour clock to optimize the device and increase that time limit?

  And finally, considering how many of the Yeerk mooks seem to be in their army for the chance to use a proper body, why the hell haven't the Andalites generated asylum boxes based on the morph boxes, which detect a yeerk's touch, give them a limited form of the morphing ability, and forcefully morph them into a body that isn't trapped in an AndIMustScream horror?
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    I understand *why* the two-hour limit had to be imposed; I mean, without it from a Doylist point of view that limits a ton of the tension that comes from A: espionage and B: outright fights, since both sides know there's a time limit and can plan around it.  Without it, a lot of the time-based tension then goes back on "I can't blow my Peter Parker persona", which is a particular brand of drama that I've never, ever liked.

    (Also, my headcanon was that the actual time limit was like 2 hours, 3 minutes, ten seconds, and that was only the beginning of the closing of the window, which allowed difficult if possible transition for another 3-5 minutes after that.  You're an alien giving advanced tech to middle-school-aged dorks, you tell them "two hours" and leave it at that.  It's not like it's a good idea for them to experiment with this limit when your only means of falsifying are to see *if you can come back from the morph or not*.)
    ```

    - u/Uncaffeinated:
      ```
      In fact, there's canon evidence that the time limit isn't exactly two hours - in the third book they're able to morph even though Tobias thinks the limit is past, but it's really difficult.
      ```

      - u/ketura:
        ```
        Yeah, that was my primary source as well.
        ```

    - u/PeridexisErrant:
      ```
      Re: headcanon - I had something similar, but also thought that it might vary based on factors unknown to human teenagers.  Again, the basic idea is that it's a bad idea to experiment when crossing the boundary has such high costs.
      ```

  - u/Uncaffeinated:
    ```
    The best explanation I could come up with is that the Andalites didn't really invent morphing technology. The Escafil device is actually a child's toy developed by a now extinct race of aliens that ended up in the Andalite's hooves. They figured out how to replicate it but still don't actually understand it.

    Also, the two hour thing is almost certainly just an approximation. Even in the books, the time limit seems to be fuzzy at the edges.
    ```

    - u/MugaSofer:
      ```
      My explanation was that the Ellimist gave it to them. He spent some time with them in canon, and for "their" technology Andalites sure don't seem to have a clue how it works.
      ```

  I welcome a rational Animorphs story, it's a world I loved as a kid and has a very rich mythology to play with.

  However, having only skimmed the first chapter, I feel like this has already failed in one aspect that has bothered me ever since I read the original series.

  Why does Elfangor stay behind? Even after you take into account everything that the Ellimist did to manipulate his life, there's no reason he couldn't have crash landed at the construction site and then morphed some alien bird to escape. And from what I gathered here, even with the changes to his personality and actions he takes, there's still no good reason why he wouldn't just see Jake and friends tell them to run and that they'd meet up later. Especially if the Time Matrix is buried in the construction site, which IIRC was the whole reason he goes there in the first place.

  In fact, I think having Elfangor live could have a very useful role from a story perspective, especially a rational story perspective. A mentor figure for them to play off with. I think you should rethink this, or at least present a plausible reason he couldn't run.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Having had some discussions with the author, without being able to have particular suspicions confirmed (merely that I was thinking in the right way), there is likely more to Elfangor's actions than we think at the moment.
    ```

    - u/True-Ninja:
      ```
      Good to hear. I look forward to it, if true.
      ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    "Having only skimmed" caused you to miss the fact that Elfangor's wounds were fatal.  Also, I'm doing my best not to level the Animorphs up/give them advantages that do not logically follow from necessary changes.  Keeping Elfangor around as a mentor definitely qualifies as a significant power boost from the original story.

    Also: Time Matrix is likely not a thing.

  Making Cassie rational will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.

    Really? The last meetup I was at, a quarter of the people there were vegetarian or vegan.

    Scott Alexander, one of the most prominent online rationalists, spends a bunch of time writing about "charity" and "niceness", and has said that he thinks animals pretty clearly have moral standing.

    Also, Effective Altruism is pretty darn popular in rationalist circles.
    ```

    - u/chaosmosis:

      My comment had nothing to do with animal rights.

      In canon, Cassie acted based on her feelings and assumptions about what was true. She got very angry at anyone who wanted to run the war like a war. She didn't discuss things, she just did whatever she wanted to / felt was right. She got them in trouble all the time because she wanted to act "morally". She got infected by a Yeerk and then let it go, hoping it would keep its word. She eventually gave Yeerks the morphing power, which could have gone ridiculously wrong, mainly because she felt bad about having to kill some of them. These decisions worked out in the end but not due to a secret master plan, just due to luck and author fiat.

      In chapter 3 of this FF, Cassie says she's not going to do anything just because the others tell her to. This independence and sense of morality can be a strength. But in a war for the survival of the species, it can also be a liability. There are ways that the author might steelman Cassie, and make her moral demands advantageous for the group. But IMO most of them would involve contrived situations and would sacrifice realism. That said, I'd love to see rational!Cassie pulled off successfully without any author cheating.

      Maybe Cassie could manage the psychological health of the group, and think about ideas long-term (perhaps "after the war" goals could be established, in the very long term). Cassie could be more aligned with the Ellimist's way of thinking than a traditional rationalist's, perhaps. In this story, it looks like Jake handles short term tactics and group coordination, as the brain of the team. Maybe Cassie keeps them from going insane, as the team's heart and soul.

      But for this to happen, she'll need to develop more realistic ethics. I'd suggest the author gradually play up the "animal assistant" angle - farmers can be ruthless when it's for the greater good of their family farm, veterinarians put down pets in pain when there's nothing else they can do to help. I'd also suggest Cassie get some vaguely Red Tribe steelmanned values, to complement this characterization. This conflicts with her characterization thus far though, because she was the first person to think about the rest of the galaxy when Elfangor mentioned it to them. Perhaps a segment showing how different alien values REALLY are from human ones would allow her to change direction on this, though.

      Otherwise, perhaps Cassie could be the group's liason to other alien groups, such as the Chee. The Chee seem rather likely to appreciate her pacifistic ethics, even if no one else does. Although the Chee's programming has its own severe problems, in a more rational setting. For one, it's slightly surprising they didn't AI Foom, or that their restrictions didn't somehow backfire.

        I really appreciated reading this comment.  Lots of food for thought.

        You can just add rationality on top of her ... niceness, I suppose. That was my point.

        The "headstrong/independent" flaw is a good one, though; it would go well with someone who grew up "defying" society's position on animal rights, war and the like.

        I'd really, really love to see Cassie as rational!hippie.

  I've only read the first chapter so far and it's been a long time since I read the books, but I don't really know why Elfangor's being portrayed as a cold utilitarian. In canon he would never have destroyed Earth just to slow down the Yeerks, especially considering that he used to live there, and I'm not sure why you made that change. Even his speech style is different, more stiff, formal, and harsh than in canon. He dies at the very beginning of his story, so it's important that within that time the reader comes to like him so that his death has maximum emotional impact and so that the mission he gives to the kids has a personal loyalty component. It's also rather important to Ax's character. Aside from that, I really liked this chapter and am looking forward to the rest. Everyone else's voices seem spot on so far and I've always wanted to read a rational Animorphs story.
  ```

  - u/callmebrotherg:
    ```
    Not the author, but speaking as somebody who really likes this planet, I'd still be tempted to blow it to smithereens if I were dealing with the sort of situation that Elfanger has been presented with. 

    And I'm saying that as somebody who's pretty into pacifism, too.
    ```

    - u/Timewinders:
      ```
      Even if he was going to do something like that, he could have just used a quantum virus like they did with the Hork-Bajir. It would have at least left some humans alive while killing enough so that the Yeerks wouldn't have enough humans to work with, so causing an extinction wouldn't have been necessary. In any case, I'm not so much bothered by the morality of the situation as by the radical, perhaps unnecessary, changes to Elfangor's personality. He wasn't a utilitarian in the books IIRC. He was appalled by how one of the other Andalites nearly wiped out the Hork-Bajir.
      ```

      - u/callmebrotherg:
        ```
        I'm not sure, but I assume that it'll make sense once we have more information about him. He hasn't been living in a bubble, after all, so we can't be certain what he's experienced in his time as a result of everyone holding the Rational Ball.
        ```

  Loving this so far. I thought about writing rational Animorphs for a bit, realized the task of optimizing everything was a herculean task and utterly beyond me, and gave up. I'm looking forward to hopefully seeing the idea done justice, and, from someone who spent hours trying to work out exactly how everything would play out... good luck.
  ```

- u/rationalidurr:
  ```
  Ok this is pretty great so far. When it was Jake's viewpoint I wanted more Jake and hated the switch to Marco. 

  But then Marco goes and ups the rationality power so I wanted more Marco and then Rachel's turn comes up and I hate it for lack of Marco's brain, but then Rachel goes "Nuh uh I am muchinkin this to the max", and then I go "Yay Rachel" , but then Rachel tells the enemy of their existence, so I'm sad now. 

  I don't know what to think anymore except, gib more.
