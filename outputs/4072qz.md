## Recommending Quests

### Post:

Recently my bookmarks have been deleted and I lost my records for a lot of interesting sites. I have recovered most of the important ones, but there is a specific set of links to certain sites I am missing. I am turning to you guys to help me recover the web links since most of the tales I liked were also recommended on here.

The sites were Space Battles, Sufficent Velocity, and Questionable Quests.

What interesting stories or quests do you guys follow on Space Battles, Sufficent Velocity, and Questionable Quests?

Note that I am not making the requirement that the stories are rational or part of any specific fandom. They can be absolutely anything that you think this sub would like.

Thank you very much!

    ```
    Mannis is surprisingly good. Might be worth posting to the subreddit if it hasn't been. Looking forward to seeing this come crashing down around his ears, since this is Westeros we are talking about.
    ```

    - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
      ```
      I know right? I mean, it's already come crashing down once already what with the boiler explosion, but I imagine you mean something a bit more permanent. 

      I hadn't actually considered posting Mannis here because it's not explicitly rationalist, but now that I think about it definitely fits the sidebar and it is a quality piece. I think I'll post it then.

  /u/Velorien and I co-write it, with worldbuilding and mechanics assistance from the inimitable /u/AugSphere and /u/FuguOfAnotherWorld (aka Jackercracks). Velorien posts Thursdays and I post Sundays.

  This is both quests and fics.

  * Polyhistor (currently going on a 1-2 year break) (Quest)

  SV:
  * Gardens of Enoch (Quest)
  * Panopticon (Quest)
  * Sha Nagba Imuru
  * Tyrant of the bay
  * Anything written by EarthScorpion. Seriously, he's the best writer on any of the three forums.
  * With This Ring

  Spacebattles:
  * But mom, I don't want to be a pirate!
  * Agent of Cauldren
  * Walk on the Moon

  - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
    ```
    As a side note, Polyhistor Quest requires one to make an account to access the NSFW section of QQ. Without that, any attempt to find it will end in failure.
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Not directly related. But you should really, really take the time to make accounts on those sites. That way you can follow threads that interest you without worrying about losing them.
  ```

- u/Rhamni:
  ```
  Polyhistor has been mentioned, but if you haven't read it I want to recommend it again.

  Also on QQ, I started running a quest earlier this week, called the City of Ruin. It may or may not be your cup of tea: It's about a group of (former) slaves with suspiciously complimentary skill sets who wake up outside a big scary ruin city in the middle of a desert. Imagine somewhere in between Evil Hogwarts and Moria. There are only two chapters out, with a third coming tomorrow.
  ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Into the Amber Age is a fun quest of SV. The Trait mechanic (where the traits acquired by the character affect what information gets passed to the voters, what options are available, and how he interprets the votes) is really fun.
  ```

- u/LeonCross:
  ```
  Panopticon - old world of darkness Technocracy quest. Great writing, mastery of the setting and mechanics, and just all around a good time. Votes are also weighted by the characters personality (so, something the character would be unlikely to do might be a .5 * number of votes, while something they're very inclined to do might be a 2* votes) which I find to be a good design decision.

  The various Sage quests are all fairly long, good rides, and fairly heavy on the feels in places.

  CORE: Control the head of a government sponsored anti-supernatural task squad, basically.

  Deathworld: Control a person on Earth after it faces two existential crisis (and both of them are still active on the planet.) Mutations, psychic powers, aliens, etc.

  https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/a-geeks-guide-deathworld-earth.302534/

  What do little dragons dream of: Control Zhang. A simple, humble farmer.

  Lastly, the Konamikode quests, which I don't have easy access to the links for. He's a great writer, and he has mastery of the feels. Unfortunately he also has the attention span of a butterfly or some other metaphore that makes more sense. 

  Two works I'd highly recommend of his: A Dragonball C2K quest following Bulma, and a MGS5 / Valkyria Chronicles (Big Boss, an extremely beat up base, and some NPCs / troops get dropped in VC just before the first game starts).

  I hear he's doing stuff on QQ now, but I haven't looked into it at all.
