  Was [RTD] a typo? It's not listed in the tags section of the sidebar.

  If it's not a typo, could you tell me what it means?

    Whoooops! Definitely a typo. It's supposed to just be "[RT]."

  Continuing to enjoy the hell out of this :) Your descriptions and the interactions between the characters are so vivid, I've rarely felt the characters as real as they are through this fic. Please keep it up!

  I knew they just had to go at it for a while on the floor before the end, but I didn't expect this!
