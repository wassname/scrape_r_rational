## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  A little late to the party but: Disco Elysium is a fantastic interactive story. (Strong warnings for: depression, suicide, substance abuse, schizophrenia?) If you are looking for a "realistic" fantasy mystery story then 1000% check it out. The voice acting is great and the way the story handles scenarios is exceptional, especially when your character fails. 

  I do want to emphasize that it's much more of a interactive story than a "game". This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's important. It's probably 80% reading, 20% clicking/walking around to read more.

  More interesting to this sub: it has the best game/narrative alignment I've ever seen. Your PC has selective but substantial amnesia and a broken brain, that are built into the story extremely well. Aspects of his personality and instinct are personified into distinct voices in his head, most notably chiming in during conversations with other characters as they "notice" things. They're basically your supporting characters, party commentary, and abilities all at once. They are also your traditional "skills", you invest in them, doing so let's you do actions using them better AND makes them speak inside your head more. More points in encyclopedia means that voice(and you) recall more science and history, which you can then use to help in the story. 

  At their extremes these shine since they also have "downsides", becoming a god of logic let's you make Sherlock Holmes like chains of deduction from the facts. But poor perception or people skills could have given you completely wrong facts to start. Or sometimes dirty boots are just normal dirty boots.

  I played a turbonerd on my playthrough, it was great. Able to walk into any scene, absorb all the evidence and assemble it into solid theories. I could reconstruct scenes in my mind, understand the historical context/symbolism, draw connections for who could've done these things, and create arguments to convince everyone of them. So my obstacles were people. I used these skills in addition to lie detection in conversations to catch and tear into any lie, omission, or diversion. Conversations were a hilarious mess because of this, and my functionally negative social/personal skills. I could, and would, detect any subterfuge but literally ran face first into walls against obstinacy. Which my approach produced a huge amount of. I gratuitously dissected allies for everything and intellectually crushed enemies (after running away from confrontation, and convincing others). I also failed personally and physically, vomiting daily for four days trying to inspect a body, cried a lot, and threw a lot of temper tantrums when people refused to confirm the color of their pubic hair a week prior. Those tantrums ran the gamut of terrifying, sad, and hilarious, while being treated correspondingly. A+ story. The failures were often more entertaining than the successes.

  Caveat: I've only completed one playthrough, with one build's perspective, and 40+ hours in. I'll be replaying as a person skilled character soon, and that might show that the game world is different than what the first go through was.

    This game shares the title of my personal GoTY 2019 (together with *Baba Is You*), and it's *by far* the best RPG I've ever played, and the most RP one at that.

    If you liked it, you might like *Return of the Obra Dinn.* Not an RPG, but also a "true" detective game, where you have to use your knowledge to progress, and the writing is quite witty, though infinitely more succinct. I found voice acting in *Obra Dinn* to be really good, too (and it being good is very important since sometimes you need to derive clues from someone's accent and/or manner of speech!).

  Reading [Do (not) Fear the Reaper](https://archiveofourown.org/works/32850550/chapters/81517519) an AU rational rewriting of Bleach from the author of The Optimised Wish Project has reminded me how much I love AU.

  Playing with characters and settings we know, but not walking the same roads that have been already walked over an over again, reimagining concepts and combining things we already know with little details of a grander world we are fed piece by piece. They serve as a union between fanfic and original fiction.

  Here are some recommendations of mine:

   &nbsp;


   &nbsp;



  [Now you feel like number none](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/now-you-feel-like-number-none-bleach-arrancar-quest.37531/) is a complete Bleach quest, where the protagonist is an Arrancar in Hueco Mundo, under Aizen's orders. 
  Fascinating story and mythology, remaking canon in something that makes sense and focusing on many secondary characters Tite Kubo dedicated no attention to.

  Combat is something I usually don't care much about, but the quest has some completely amazing battles that I have bookmarked to read as one shots, having some of the best individual chapters I've ever read.

  Its main weakness was a slow update rate, but it finished two months ago, so that has stopped being a problem.
  Very intense, very character focused and in my top 10 of all books read.

   &nbsp;




  [The Unseen Hunt](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/13073342/1/The-Unseen-Hunt) is a RWBY AU fanfic made by Coeur Al'Aran that deserves more love. The author is loved and hate for his many different RWBY fanfics, often starring a less annoying Jaune.

  The story is set in a mystery modern urban fantasy, with many of the main characters being adapted to the setting. Very good, very different from other RWBY fanfics, not sure how much I can tell without spoiling things.



   &nbsp;



  Finally, [Man the walls, bare the steel](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17211749) is a short a Practical Guide to Evil snippet where Callow is a Bad country and Praes a Good one. Currently my favourite PGTE fanfic, leaves you looking forward to more with a very interesting setting. Hope to see more chapters one day.

   &nbsp;


  So, that's all, was going to write more recommendations but this is getting to lengthy already. What fics do you recommend where the world is significantly different from canon? Or where they try to make a coherent story out of many plot holes? Please share your favourite AU fanfics.

    Huh, didn't realize there was hate for this author. I've read several of his things and enjoyed most of them (I remember [Forged Destiny](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/12044591/1/Forged-Destiny) being my favorite among them). Why do some people dislike his writing? Unless they dislike RWBY in general, I guess?

    >Finally, Man the walls, bare the steel is a short a Practical Guide to Evil snippet where Callow is a Bad country and Praes a Good one. Currently my favourite PGTE fanfic, leaves you looking forward to more with a very interesting setting. Hope to see more chapters one day.

      ```
      >Why do some people dislike his writing? Unless they dislike RWBY in general, I guess?

      He doesn't have much respect for later RWBY canon, but that's not a *huge* issue because most fans don't have respect for later RWBY canon. There are more pressing issues. He's one of the authors who makes Jaune the main protagonist of their work - I don't have any particular issue with his characterization, but it's a continuation of a pitfall RWBY nearly fell into in the first three seasons where a supporting character became more important than the main one. A lot of people resent fanfiction in this subgenre because of it.

      There are also nitpicks I *personally* am annoyed with. I believe Coeur leaves his ships up to patrons or poll, which makes the romantic arcs feel pretty shoehorned in. There's sometimes a bit of unnecessary and weird sexualization of the characters. Nothing out of the norm for fanfiction but definitely cringeworthy. The worst flaw of his stories is plot contrivance and Diabolus ex Machina designed to make the lives of the characters pointlessly worse - often driving a wrench between their relationships in a way that's really unsatisfying and painful.

      It's been a while since I read it, but my fanfiction.net review history shows that while reading *Forged Destiny* something really rubbed me the wrong way in Chapter 75 along those lines - >!Blake takes the fall for something Jaune does, even if he clearly and obviously saved a life in the process. Meanwhile, Jaune left evidence which pointed *directly* to him in a "fit of rage" specifically so that the author could set up this dramatic arc. She then socially ostracizes him for it instead of, *talking* and it's really fucking frustrating.!< Each of his stories takes Jaune's character in a direction similar to canon, with Jaune lying about something to gain entrance to Beacon, but *unlike* canon instead of people being cool with it because he's got a Hunter's spirit and he's *better* now, it's always held up as this big dramatic reveal. And when the reveal inevitably drops, his characters all suddenly become assholes about it in a way which completely destroys my suspension of disbelief. Often times Jaune is *many times* more competent and friendly and sociable than canon, and yet he still can't salvage his way out of a lie which, given his performance track record, clearly didn't matter that much. This single recurring plot thread makes it very hard for me to pick any of his stories up, even knowing some get better later.
      ```

      - u/AurelianoTampa:
        ```
        Thank you for the comprehensive response; reading your reasoning, I can definitely understand how the author can rub some people raw. His writing didn't grate on me that much, but I now understand how it can for others.

        Have a great day!
        ```

        - u/Robert_Barlow:
          ```
          I should thank you for bringing it up again. It's been a while since I read his stories and there are some I've just gotten the urge to reread now. I'll see if I can get a review of *Professor Arc* and it's sequel done in time for next Monday's thread along with my comprehensive post.
          ```

    - u/Darkpiplumon:
      ```
      The main criticism I've seen against Coeur is Jaune being a Mary Sue in name only, and repetitiveness.

      In the hiatus between books, the folks at r/PracticalGuidetoEvil have been making an effort to draw fanart and write fanfic, there are some nice short stories there. Probably the most popular there is [A Practical Guide to Redemption](https://archiveofourown.org/works/27775966/chapters/67993762), where Akua travels back in time and tries to be a good person. It has recently started its second book.

    This is one of the main premises of [Eight](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/26734/eight), a story by 3seed. An old man dies and gets iseki'd into a pre-industrial deathworld as a child. Much of the plot involves him having to carve out a home in the woods while avoiding or killing magical predators that would happily eat him. He has to constantly worry about where his next meal is coming from, and he builds most of his own tools.

    I thought it was pretty cool, and the story does some very unique stuff. It's also technically a LitRPG, if that matters to you, but I felt it was done well.

      "To the Stars" is one of my all time favorite fanfics. The anime it is based off of, *Puella Magi Madoka Magika*, is some-what rational adjacent since it is a deconstruction of the magical girl genre.

      [Fargo](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11228999/1/Fargo) is also a great fanfic of the same series, though with a darker tone (as implied by the name). I think of it as *Madoka Magica* in the style of *Pact* by Wildbow.

              Yes, but the author could have chosen any random, podunk town in the northern midwest to start the story in. For that matter, they aren't required to name the entire story after a location that only shows up briefly in the first chapter, or to name the story after the first introduced protagonist (who isn't actually the PoV character for a significant amount of the plot.)

              The author chose a name that would be instantly recognizable and call up associated memories for any reader who is familiar with the movie. Based on the tone and thematic similarities that I mentioned, it seems reasonable to me that the author meant it as an allusion.

  Any good recommendations for *written* works with what I think is called a third-person objective viewpoint (or something like that)?  
  I recently watched Primer - excellent movie, I highly recommend it here - and I found myself curious as to how you'd capture some of the feeling but in a written work. The feeling of watching characters interact without being in any of their minds, but also giving enough information through their discussions to piece together what is happenings. This highly enhances the mind games aspect of the show, since you're piecing together what is occurring yourself without getting obviously led along it by a character's thoughts. It also helps with the story not exactly having a protagonist, or at least not where you are riding along with them.  
  This is often done in movies, but I don't explicitly remember seeing it in writing before. Then again, I was never particularly looking for this style of writing.
  ```

  - u/ketura:
    ```
    Old epics such as the Illiad follow this style (if one is to believe Julian Jaynes, this is because people had not yet developed the *concept*).

    I suspect mysteries would do the same for the reasons you point out, tho it's been a long time since I read one myself.
    ```

    - u/netstack_:
      ```
      Hmm, I’d expect mysteries to do the opposite—get you in the detective’s or witness’s head so that they can unfold the puzzle. See Doyle’s Watson, or a Chandler noir protagonist, or Christie’s Hastings. In visual media this gets done through dialogue but I’m used to seeing more monologue and, well, description in a first person mystery.

      I think I agree with you on the Iliad. The characters definitely talk about their motivations and values, and there’s no first person. But it might be more 3rd person omniscient than objective? It’s been a while since I’ve read it, but how much of the characterization is done by observation vs. the narrator’s description? “Achilles sulked” is just descriptive but “sing, o muse, of the rage of Achilles” is sort of in his head.

  Curveball request: recommendations for works in the original  Chinese. Preferably not too difficult, my Chinese isn't that good. Last one I read was 全职高手 because of the anime adaption, and it took me until now to finish it. Preferably completed.

    Try The Legendary Mechanic. As far as power-fantasy trash goes, it's on the higher end of that low bell curve. Pretty enjoyable if you just treat it like the power-fantasy that it is.

    As for your rant:

    Master of All Trades absolutely would not have made a better title. It is generic and sets up reader expectations wrong. Master of All Trades as a title can be slotted into a fantasy isekai story, a sci-fi system story, a wuxia story, etc. 

    It would also be more accurate to translate it to "Master of All {Video Game} Classes" because of context. 

     I don't recall the exact reason, but there was one. It's been years since I read it on its original website, and when it was moved over to a new non-WordPress site, the explanations in the translator's notes were lost. There were explanations (and a small amount of reader feedback) on a lot of the translations of names and such. Names were updated a lot in the beginning.

    Then, when it was transferred over Webnovel, it was "legit" and the translator was able to directly discuss the English Terms with the author. There were some changes made there, Thousand Chance Umbrella -> Myriad Manifestations Umbrella. Some minor changes I don't remember. Everything else is basically approved by exclusion, especially the Title.

    The King's Avatar is "cool". "Master of All Trades" is also cool, but less cool because it is generic. You could probably run a marketing test on this, and I think it is likely that the target audience would agree. (Otherwise, there would be no reason for adaptations to accept it.)

    >!The King's Avatar is also much closer to the story beats. The protagonist is the "Master of All Classes". !<

    >!The King's Avatar refers to the professional avatar he had to give up AND his new avatar. No one knew the protagonist's face because he avoided marketing completely; his fans only knew him through his avatar. His professional avatar is "The King's Avatar". However, he is still the Glory encyclopedia king, and his new avatar eventually becomes "The King's Avatar". When he faces in a duel with his previous avatar somewhere in the middle, it's close to a title drop where he proves that it is the King that makes it "The King's Avatar".  As far as pretentiousness goes, you'll get way more mileage out of "The King's Avatar".!<

    There are many such translation issues caused by cultural/context disconnect.


    In English, 君莫笑 is roughly "Sir (,) Don't Laugh" and in context, "Please don't laugh."

    As a character name, it is an arrogant flex name in Chinese taken from 涼州詞.

    [https://eastasiastudent.net/china/classical/wang-han-liangzhou-verse/](https://eastasiastudent.net/china/classical/wang-han-liangzhou-verse/)

    There are some loose parallels with this name that become apparent later. Old Soldiers = Old Pros. Wine=Glory.

    It's an awesome name, but not in English. The literal translation is awkward in English.  I remember the readers and translators eventually deciding on a very literal Lord Grim, throwing the context of his name in the translator's note (now lost), and agreeing it made the story flow much better than "Please Don't Laugh" or "Sir, Don't Laugh". 

    Almost all the "made-up" names have this issue. Their direct translations into English do not flow and/or miss context. It can't really be helped.

      I appreciate the thought, though that's not quite what I'm looking for! I did just finish an entire 5-mil characters Chinese web novel (although really slowly), so at least I'd like to think I've moved beyond these kinds of short stories that's used to improve reading comprehension. 

      I'm looking for other r!adjacent light novels and web novels originally in Chinese. There were a few recommendations of translated Chinese works circulating, so I'm wondering if there's any highly recommended completed stories to go through.  

      Failing that, trashy powerlevel stuff will do as well, I suppose.

    If you're comfortable with glowfic, Efflugence has an arc related to this. Starts at: [sunnydale welcomes you](https://www.glowfic.com/posts/1116).

    Personally, I have mixed feelings. There are some really interesting ideas in there but I wasn't always a big fan of the characterisation.

    Also the characters have completely different identities which might be a dealbreaker for you but they play recognisable roles imo.

      Thanks for the rec.

      By the way, if you ever want to buy an actual repeating crossbow in real life, check here: https://gogun.co

      *Edit:* Repeating crossbows weren't a thing you could just order over the Internet in 2013, but they are now.  I though that was interesting, since Bella mentions ordering a repeating crossbow as one of her first activities as Slayer.

          I guess it all depends on "The Masquerade" and how well that has been holding up.  While various governments had *secret* programs concerning vampires and demons in general in the Buffyvese, IIRC the public was largely kept in the dark.
          ```

          - u/SpeakKindly:
            ```
            There's an episode where some students speak up about how they go to a school where the newspaper has an obituary section and generally they're not sure *what* is up but they know that something's up and Buffy's doing *something* and they're grateful.

            So I doubt there would be repeating crossbows sold on vampire-hunter-crossbows.com, but it seems like the sort of situation where the public is in the dark but kind of has a feeling that this would help.

    Self-plug time: [Successor](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/successor-btvs.53169/), where Buffy Summers essentially becomes mayor-by-conquest after the end of S3.

    *It's a quest, but it's not mechanical. Voters get a choice each update, either influencing Buffy's personal actions and decisions or more rarely pushing the narrative in one or another direction. In my view being a quest in the first place helps to avoid idiot balls because voters don't make dumb choices just because plot. I've been surprised by write-ins before which have triggered entire previously unplanned episodes.

    *It might not be precisely rational, but it's definitely rational-adjacent with some of its themes including >!Artificial Intelligence!< and >!Vampire morality.!<

    *What's already there is very long at 460k. This may be a plus or minus. Updates are usually in the range of 3-4k and happen about once a week or sometimes a little slower. Updates are grouped into "episodes" which are generally about 20k, so you can read it in chunks (though it might tend to be slightly more serial than the original series was.)

    *While I am respectful to canon (especially S1-3 canon), I've done my best to flesh out and expand the setting multiverse in a way that both makes sense and fits the aesthetics that are already there. I've drawn in a not-tiny amount of fusion material and ideas from >!Animorphs!< in particular, which might be of interest to people in this community.

    [*Life's ending, life's beginning*](https://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=14121) is an excellent story, and at least not *anti-*rational like most of the setting - after the S3 finale turns out to be a disaster, Buffy winds up joining the Air Force.  The slow way, by enrolling in the Academy.

    Eventually a Stargate crossover, but subtlety and learning are major themes.  The biggest downside is that the story is incomplete on a worse-than-cliffhanger, and with the author deceased there's no hope of further updates.  Recommended.

    --------------

    [*Stingers*](https://www.tthfanfic.org/wholestory.php?no=24258) and sequel *101st* also tell the story of a Buffy who joins the US Air Force while hiding slayer-ness... this time in 1939 as a pilot.  (She did after all jump off a tower and through a portal)

  Currently reading Library of Heaven's Path. It's neither rational nor amazingly well written, but it's probably the best 'junk food xianxia' I've read (Comparing it to ISSTH and Reverend Insanity). The MC is peak weaponized autism and the author's ability to pull off the same exact 5 plots a dozen times in a row without letting them get stale is truly remarkable. It's also 2k+ chapters, which is a huge plus if you burn through material as fast as I do.

      The supply of fiction is effectively infinite. But access to the full scope of it requires you to either use libraries, which effectively means dead trees, or to be willing to spend money quite freely on e-books. The supply of free and e-format fiction is not quite as bottomless.

    Somewhat related: it'd be nice if people adopted ranking media by pairwise comparisons. /u/gwern made a post about it (& wrote a tool) [here](https://www.gwern.net/Resorter). Based on it, I started writing a webapp which would pull lists from various sites & let user re-rank items based on visual representations ([like this](https://imgur.com/a/OKCJ47t)). Unfortunately, sth is broken.

    > You might think that asking about only the two media with the current biggest standard error would be the best exploration strategy (since this corresponds to reinforcement learning and multi-armed bandit approaches where you start off by exploring the most uncertain things), but surprisingly, this leads to asking about the same media again and again, even as the standard error plummets. 

    > I’m not sure why this happens, but I think it has to do with the prior information creating an ordering or hierarchy on all the media, and then the maximum-likelihood estimating leads to repeating the same question again and again to shift the ordering up or down the cardinal scale (even our discretized ratings will be invariant no matter how the estimates are translated up and down).

    > So instead, we alternate between asking about the media with the largest standard error (choosing the nearest neighbor, up or down, with the larger standard error), and occasionally picking at random, so it usually focuses on the most uncertain ones but will occasionally ask about other media as well. (Somewhat analogous to fixed-epsilon exploration in RL.)

    ...and it leads to a zillion comparisons of, in the linked example, Madoka Magica and Death Note. (I chose Madoka consistently [through I'm not really sure]). Sometimes there are other questions because of the .33% chance of random selection, but at this point it might be improvement to just ask random questions all the time & ignore standard error.

    Maybe in addition to the problem Gwern described I also implemented it wrongly (I don't know R, and rpy2 documentation is not very legible) and that's why it fails so badly. Standard errors aren't equal by the way; Madoka is 24046.70549633379, DN is 24046.705459294666. Score is 25.5-0.5 (because at init both were tied, 0.5-0.5).

    My GH profile is kinda sad, but since I brought it up I'll [link](https://github.com/Sinity/pwrank) to the repo. [This](https://github.com/Sinity/pwrank/blob/master/backend/webrankit/pairwise.py) file does the math (or rather interfaces with it).

    ----

    Anyway; I wonder, provided such tool existed and worked well, if there's a way to incentivize people already using anilist & such to rank stuff that way, to get a more accurate list of "best anime" and such. Paying would just make people pick at random or bot.
    ```

      > I wonder, provided such tool existed and worked well, if there's a way to incentivize people already using anilist & such to rank stuff that way

      Well, what would make people *care* about creating a correct ranked list? There's no way to check the list's correctness, so trying to directly reward the voters is, indeed, pointless. How can you reward anime themselves, then?

      Commit to pay the creators responsible for any given anime a percentage of money from a vast money pool proportional to their anime's placement in the final rankings? The voters would need to only be allowed to vote on the anime they'd had on their "watched" list prior to this competition's announcement, naturally, and only the votes of those who'd resolved every pairwise comparison should be counted.

      The incentives aren't perfectly aligned here, of course. Some anime creators might be disliked even if their shows are considered good, some are outright dead, and it's not clear what to do if a creator is responsible for multiple anime. Do we just add the money up? This'll create the perverse incentive to vote for all of your favourite creator's shows, even those you don't like.

      Maybe instead fund continuations/spin-offs/remakes/merchandize of the shows? Of course, some shows don't need additional content, or are less merchandize-able than the others.

      Commit to, for all future anime announced next year, calculate U = Σ(V^(i)(X, Y)) for *i* = [1; n], where *i* is a ranked anime, *n* is the total number of to-rank anime, *X* is an indicator of how "similar" the future anime is to the *i*th ranked anime, and *Y* is the ranked anime's rank, and pay U^(k)/Σ(U)% of the money pool to the people in charge of producing every *k*th future anime? "Similarity" is ill-defined, would create perverse incentives to create clones of popular anime, some people don't want more of the same, a host of other problems...

      Fund advertisement campaigns for every ranked anime, using a fraction of the money pool proportional to the anime's placement, so that more people could learn of it and watch it? ... Hm, this might work. Who doesn't want their favourite show watched and discussed by others, for fanart and fanfics of it to be created, for its ideas to be absorbed by the rest of the industry and *organically* integrated in future anime, for its creators to receive revenue from new sales? Well, plenty of people::show combinations wouldn't want that, but a comparably small number, I think. This sort of accomplishes all of the above, but in a better way.

      Okay, just need the cooperation of a world-class advertisement apparatus. Easy-peasy.

      > but at this point it might be improvement to just ask random questions all the time & ignore standard error

      Haven't read the article yet, but why not just... not let it ask the same question to the same user again? What's the value in that?

    The closest thing to a professional critic for anime would be youtubers.

    I guess a movie critic could branch into animation but most things are in series format.

    I would recommend finding and following a particular user on myanimelist or similar. Honestly, when someone records a score for 1/2 the shows in every season I'd consider them experienced enough to be a professional. You just need to account for their individual taste and find someone who agrees with you on shows you've already seen and liked.
    ```

  - u/EdenicFaithful:
    ```
    Some searching suggests that the answer is no, not really. I did find [this](https://thecartdriver.com/animetacritic-v-2-more-reviewers-more-lists/) which aggregated bloggers. It has some odd results but I see a lot of greats like *Nadesico* and *Votoms*.

    So it looks like you're stuck checking the reviewers themselves. Wikipedia keeps citing [Helen McCarthy's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_McCarthy) books like *500 Essential Anime You Must Own* if that helps.
