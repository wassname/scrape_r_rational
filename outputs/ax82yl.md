## [D] Monday Request and Recommendation Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  I read over the weekend the ongoing webfiction [Vacant Throne](https://tcthrone.wordpress.com/) and was pleasantly impressed. It moves a little faster than I would prefer, not allowing the MC to really explore her new world. But the characters & their motivations, the magic system, and the overall plot were all a step up from most of the self-published fictions you generally find online.

  Kudos to the author for improving their game over **Void Domain**, their previous work, which I dropped partway through.

    Just archive binged it.  Seconded.

  - u/CouteauBleu:
    ```
    I dunno. I've tried a few chapters, and the writing seems really awkward so far. The author isn't really selling me the mindset of someone who just killed two people for the first time in their life, in a life-or-death situation, while getting *a divine apparation* at the same time.

  I was recently in the mood for some rational romance and finally got around to checking out [the Valentine's r!romance thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/aqwvxm/d_the_oops_better_late_than_never_romance_in/). /u/JanusTheDoorman had an interesting take on why r!romance is scarce, though I don't agree that utility maximizing motivations are "inhuman" or necessarily antithetical to pursuing (emotional) satisfaction. Plus, characters like that are pretty much by definition unsatisfied with some aspect of society's status quo, but they might have a soft spot or blindspot for some social institutions. 

  All this is to say that I think I've got the perfect recommendation for JanusTheDoorman's request at the end:

  >It'd be interesting to see a rational fiction written about a protagonist who is rational and exacting in pursuit of their goals, but those goals are selfish and amoral - a satisfying love life, high status, power and resources, 

  [**Birds of a Feather**](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936) by babylonsheep

  You might know the author from his community artwork or from his previous Worm fanfiction, [Tabloid](https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/tabloid-worm-artfic-%E2%80%94-complete.455278/), one of the best rational explorations of day-to-day cape life. I don't want to spoil anything, so let's just say Tom Riddle is a shoo-in for the selfish, amoral, rational protagonist award in this coming-of-age AU. 

  P.S. Great scene setting for 1930-1940s England too.
  ```

  - u/sparkc:
    ```
    This is fantastic so far. Great prose and the author's done a great job of finding the characters voices. 

    That the story begins in the orphanage, with barely a hint of the fantastical, and i'm not the least bit waiting for magic and Hogwarts to enter the scene because i'm already enjoying it so much, speaks a lot of the story for me.
    ```

  - u/JanusTheDoorman:
    ```
    Thanks for the recommendation!
    ```

  - u/JohnKeel:
    ```
    Oh, nice - Tabloid was one of the only actually-good Worm fanfics I've read.

    ```
    I just got up to date on Birds of a Feather and it really had me itching for a good Dumbledore-in-school fic.
    ```

    - u/nytelios:
      ```
      Never came across one, nor have I looked for that premise. It seems pretty darn hard to find a good one, since there's much less canonical material to work with during Dumbledore's 19th century school years. Also it'll probably be slash, which shares the same kind of fanfic stigma as pairing fics.

      However, I assume you're at least partially interested to see the life and times of a genius in Hogwarts, so all I've got is another very canonically plausible Dumbledore during Riddle's school years. Probably my favorite depiction of Dumbledore in fanfiction, though the protagonist is still Tom.

  [*Freeways*](https://captaingames.itch.io/freeways) is an extremely fun game, in which the player designs highway interchanges and is scored based on (1) the average speed of traversing vehicles, (2) the amount of concrete used in construction (affected by how much roadway is present and whether the roadway is at low, medium, or high elevation), and (3) the complexity of the interchange (as measured by an algorithm that is opaque to the player). The player has a limited (but usually fairly generous) amount of concrete to complete each puzzle. Traffic inputs and outputs are not limited to the edge of the map, but may take the form of rectangles inside the map.

  The game definitely isn't perfect: the lack of an undo button or an erase tool forces the player to delete the entire interchange and start the puzzle over if he makes a mistake; a long play session will leave the player's wrist aching from constantly holding down the left mouse button for the "draw roadway" function, which can't be rebound to the keyboard (compare *Minecraft*, where the "mine" function *can* be rebound to the keyboard); and vehicles occasionally will block each other when transitioning between elevation levels when it seems they shouldn't do so. However, at $4 for a DRM-free purchase, it's a steal!

  A gameplay video can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDlzPVXzcsU). Several animations of puzzle solutions have been posted [here](https://boards.4channel.org/wsg/thread/2711773#p2720237).

  The web comic Girl Genius:
  http://girlgeniusonline.com/

  Beautifully drawn, with feuding steampunk Mad Scientists rampaging and adventuring across Europa. Includes monsters that should not be, giant airships, massive clockwork doom machines, time travel, a sociopathic living castle, duels between the rival empires of the underworld, zombie plagues and many more wonders of Science!

  - u/Sonderjye:

    What makes this rational?
    ```

    - u/tjhance:
      ```
      It's not.

      I really like girlgenius, and I second the recommendation, it's a fun action-adventure with a complex plot and fun characters, but it isn't rational.

      Off the top of my head, I can't recall anybody holding the idiot ball, but the workings of the spark are pretty opaque so you never know what's actually possible. Rationality-wise, the best that can be said is that one of the main antagonists is really well-written, coming into conflict with the protagonist out of his justified belief that it's necessary for maintaining peace in his territory.
      ```

      - u/andor3333:
        ```
        Agreed, it isn't rational, just a really fun read if you like mad science adventure, which is why I didn't post it in directly to the subreddit.   (Also they are sparks, so lots of them not only do hold the idiot ball, but proceed to detonate it as a weapon, eat it to see if it gives superpowers, or juggle multiple idiot balls while riding a giant robot and deciding what order they should take the first two options.)
        ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      The aesthetic is somewhat close to it. Characters are fairly smart, have reasonable beliefs, and mostly act based on their incentives, biases and personality. It's all very cartoonish and exaggerated (eg, it's the kind of story where the protagonists would start looking for a spy in a dinner party, except it turns out *everyone* at the party is a spy for a different government organization), but within the bounds of the medium everyone's decision and personality makes sense.

      Also, the aesthetic is pretty rational-like. This is the kind of story where the villains often say "Screw this, let's play it safe" and immediately shoots James Bond; where the protagonists will say "You know what, let's make a backup of the Giant Evil Portal Disruptor, just in case the first one fails", and otherwise makes fun of similar adventure story tropes.

        > it's the kind of story where the protagonists would start looking for a spy in a dinner party, except it turns out everyone at the party is a spy for a different government organization

        Gee, canâ€™t think of any ratfic where that was ever a trope...
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          ... you mean the School Battles arc in HP:MoR? It's a little different from what I had in mind, but sure.

  Reminder: just because [Animorphs: The Reckoning](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046) hasn't updated in a while doesn't mean it's not mandatory reading for every r/rational member anymore.

  There *will* be random *The Reckoning* quizzes. Anyone who fails them *will* be brutally terminated. You have been warned.

  Anyway, there have been a few new fics popping up here lately. Are any of them good?

  - u/emilybanc:
    ```
    Do you think it would be still be good if you've never read an animorphs book before and only have a vague notion of what it's about from some episodes you saw on tv as a kid?
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yeah. The first chapters are a little fast-paced and assume that you're already familiar with the setting, but at no point does the plot become impossible to follow if you haven't read the originals.

      (well, the oatmeal reveal is a little weird if you haven't read the original, but whatever)

      Plus, the basic concept is pretty straightforward to begin with: evil mind-control aliens are invading, friendly alien gives superpowers to a bunch of kids to fight them.
      ```

    - u/sparkc:
      ```
      All i knew about animorphs going in was that it was about a bunch of kids that could turn into animals, no more, and i love the story.
      ```

    - u/hyphenomicon:
      ```
      Yes, I think so. You might not appreciate how much richness was added to the source material - descriptions of alien mindsets are WAY better than in canon - but that's just a small bonus.
      ```

- u/CrovaxII:
  ```
  I'm looking for something with an anti-hero or retired villain protagonist. The kind of person who gets the job done in the most efficient possible way, even if it's incredibly brutal, often to the shock of the more 'heroic' characters. Bonus points for [What the Hell Hero?](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WhatTheHellHero) moments, when the 'heroic' character(s) are actually causing more problems than they solve.

  I would also be interested in villain protagonists who put villainy on hold to deal with a problem that the heroes are too stupid to see/don't see as a problem, like [The Metropolitan Man](https://fictionhub.io/story/the-metropolitan-man/)
  ```

  - u/Palmolive3x90g:
    ```
    [Order of The Stick](http://www.giantitp.com/comics/oots0001.html) has a pretty big 'what the hell hero' moment. It's a webcomic set in a DnD setting were the fourth wall has been battered to the point the characters talk about the game mechanics of the universe all the time.

    [Inviolate](https://fanfiction.net/s/5536346/1/Inviolate) is a fan fix staring lex Luther and has him end up fighting against a world wide conspiracy. It start off really good but gradually gets worse over time untill I just strudled to read any more around chapter 14. I would recommend reading the first chapter as a one shot.

    I have a list of stories that I keep which involve characters dealing with romance and sex in intelligent and reasonable ways (even if they don't necessarily do the same outside of relationships). Most of the linked stories have sex scenes, but not all of them are pornographic. Also, I posted nearly the exact same list to the previous Valentine's Day Thread.

    I'm too lazy to write up summaries for each rec, so I'm just copy-pasting the summary descriptions even if they aren't the best.

    [Condiut](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/conduit-rwby.6471/) \[RWBY\]\[NSFW\] - Come for the kinky spirit sex and cool powers, stay for the responsible approach to polygamous relationships and deep philosophical dilemmas!

    [Amelia](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/amelia-worm-au.916/) \[Worm AU\] - Amy Dallon is pushed by the S9, hard enough to actually \*fight back\*. From there, things diverge from canon.

    [The Sins of Cinnamon](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-sins-of-cinnamon.7774/) \[Original Fiction\]\[NSFW\] - Everyone is born with a birth class and a gift, and everyone with a particularly dangerous class gets monitored and registered. Everyone gets a career class once they start working, but Artificer became more popular than Adventurer years ago. There are dungeons, but they've been sealed. There are dragons, but they were nearly hunted to extinction and now the nature preserves are well guarded. Prostitution isn't illegal, which is good, because Cinnamon Wallace likes being open about who and what she is. The gods left the world years ago, it is said that they will never  return, not until all the world is dust, and the stars rain like fire from the sky. And so, when an Oracle prophesied that Cinnamon Wallace would one day meet a god, and be judged for her sins, the Oracle's words were dismissed. Surely, if the world was going to end, someone else would have also foreseen it?

    [Monster Girl City: Ace Detective](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/monstergirlcity-ace-detective.3154/) \[Monster Girl Quest\]\[NSFW\] - You are Monstergirlcity's only human woman and detective, the legendary Ace. What bizarre mystery will you face? Here's a [link](https://fiction.live/stories/monstergirlcity-ace-detective/ozWAGdPAACtkX4dJ5) to the original site for the story.

    [A Rousing Rebirth](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/a-rousing-rebirth-veilfall-original.5813/) \[Original Fiction\]\[NSFW\] - *A Rousing Rebirth* is the story of two magical girls and their origins, their adventures, and their intimate lives, in a near-future alternate history which presents them with challenges both familiar and exotic.

    [My Completely Normal Parahuman: Tantric is Magic](https://archiveofourown.org/works/11508537/chapters/25824003) \[Worm\]\[NSFW\] - Being a Tantric Witch is harder than you think. First, dealing with the fact that you got it from your mother. Second, the trauma from finding the ten pounds of anal beads in the back of her wardrobe confirming that you got it from your mother. Third, it's pretty hard to be a hero when your power comes from sex, lust, and rock'n'rollin the boat. The fourth and most difficult part about the whole thing though? My name is Taylor Hebert... and I look like a fucking stripper.

    [Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest (No SV, you are the Waifu)](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/battle-action-harem-highschool-side-character-quest-no-sv-you-are-the-waifu.15335/) \[Original Fiction\] - So, after seeing too many harem series, I made a quest. A lot of IS and it's innumerable derivatives, a lot of Muv-Luv (very Ironic I know), a lot of Knight Run, some Sentou Yousei Yukikaze, mixed together with my personal antipathy for harem series, we get this. Battle-Action-Harem-Highschool... Side Character Quest. No Sufficient Velocity. You ***are*** the waifu.

    [Erogamer](https://forum.questionablequesting.com/threads/the-erogamer-original.5465/) \[Gamer\]\[NSFW\] - The story of a human being who one day saw a status screen displaying her BOD, LST, SED, FUK, PRV, and ERO. "This is more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest." --- all of the readers. This is way more depth than I was expecting with my porn quest, even taking the previous statement into account." --- Sirrocco

    [The Pilfered Princess](https://www.asstr.org/~A_Strange_Geek/novels/PilferedPrincess/) \[Original Fiction\]\[NSFW\] -  An evil sorcerer kidnaps a princess in his bid for conquest, but gets more than he bargained for. A humorous sendup of formula fantasy stories.

    [The Simulacrum](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/23173/the-simulacrum) \[Original Fiction\] - An amnesiac guy from our world is sent into a harem romance comedy show, except instead of being the protagonist, which is the typical thing for how these stories tend to go, he is the idiot friend of the protagonist. The world closely follows narrative tropes from the genre and he uses his genre savviness to avoid awkward situations that normally arise out of these stories, and figure out what's going on and  why he is here.

    [The Care and Feeding of Magical Creatures](https://archiveofourown.org/works/17061161/chapters/40116860) \[Original Fiction\]\[NSFW\] - When I was nineteen, a sweet and very determined succubus came to abduct me out of my bed and off to her home in Pandemonium. Getting off Earth  was a wild ride, but it was nothing compared to what happened after we escaped...

    [Ship of the Line (Forever After Earth #1)](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1246519/chapters/2562553) \[Buffy the Vampire Slayer/Multi-Crossover\]\[NSFW\] -  To get Willow to wear a more daring costume, Buffy and Xander agree to go in the same costume Willow does. Buffy picks a set of matching costumes that are something called FAE... When the spell wears off, Buffy, Xander, and Willow are left with new bodies, life-changing memories, and a city-sized starship. Hijinks Ensue.

  **recommendation**

  I would like to recommend r/JumpChain specifically their [jump link page](https://www.reddit.com/r/JumpChain/comments/58wjvc/relevant_jumpchain_links_jumps_builds_etc/) that has a huge list of CYOA's for various different fictions.

  The premise of jump chain is that every ten years you go to new a fictional world and get to select perks and disadvantages, baced on a pre made CYOA document, for that world. As you can imagine, after a few 'jumps' if you are picking perks intelligently, your character becomes an unstoppable God and it ceases to be a challenge.

  If you only take jumps on there own, or impose challenges on yourself, it can be a stimulating mental exorcise to maximize your odds of survivel. I enjoy balancing the perks and drawbacks to get the most power with the least risk and I find it fun to look at a jump after I have finished a series.

  Also this [picture](https://i.redd.it/u4x6m9e3l3k21.jpg).

  **request**

  I have come to despise nigh omniscient characters in fiction as all the examples of them being used I have seen tend to cause plot holes when the don't take the actions they should to achieve there goal. Or worse were added to cover up plot holes in the worse possible way. Infinity War, Worm and The last god kubra are all examples of this to some extent.

  Dose anyone have a recommendation for something containing a nigh omniscient (or something like that) used well?

  EDIT: spelling.
