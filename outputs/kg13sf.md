  It is a huge deal in story.  No one just accepts it

  ```
  Since you're asking for specific spoilers: Bethel is immediately and decisively removed from the party and measures are taken to ensure that Juniper does not have to interact with her or be anywhere near her. Nobody in-story accepts her or accepts what she did as okay.
