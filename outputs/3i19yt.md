  Too-short plot summary: A man wants to open a pickle factory. His family helps out. Some complications ensue.

  This story is something I've had trouble finding: An exploration of what could be accomplished with real-world munchkinry, without any magic or questionable superscience. The basic premise is explained in the first chapter: A few centuries ago, a set of ten families pledge to support each other over king and country, founding a sort of cabal, the titular Pfand, which has slowly grown to the present day.

  The main plot of the story, in which [spoiler](#s "the Pfand conflicts with a cabal of the sociopaths who have gained great wealth and power, and have nefarious plans to seize control of just about everything"), and how the protagonist gets caught up in it all, may not be spectacular, but forms the stage on which the Pfand's various details get explored.

  (Rating note: Despite the hosting site, this story doesn't contain any titillating sexual content, though sex is referred to and it does include mention of prostitution as a significant job, and there's reasonable amounts of violence.)
