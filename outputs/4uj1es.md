## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  The [vlogbrothers](https://www.youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers) (John and Hank Green's popular YouTube channel) **[tried something interesting](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dtzfu9RpTs)** last week that I thought I'd mention.

  Hank was sick of the cesspool of hate and intolerance that is YouTube video comments, and suggested that the reason they are so universally terrible is the YouTube comment promotion algorithm, which tends to feature the comments that get the most replies. Due to reasons explored in Scott Alexander's [The Toxoplasma of Rage](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/) or CGP Grey's [This Video Will Make You Angry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc), this inevitably rewards the most controversial, divisive comments instead of the comments that bring the most to the conversation.

  Having no control over YouTube's algorithms, Hank asked vlogbrothers viewers to game the system, by replying with a single plus-sign to high-quality but uncontroversial comments. It's been working fairly well so far at the stated goal of vastly improving the quality of the comments that appear on the front page of their videos.

  It has had the side-effect of making genuine discussion difficult, because substantive replies get buried in a sea of "+"s, but (a) that's still a strict improvement, since there was no genuine discussion happening *before* either, because no one was ever *seeing* the good comments, and (b) that's a potentially fixable problem; e.g., someone has already written a [Greasemonkey script](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-plus-filter/lhjhfienbklemmabjgkepbiihihnhacg) to hide all "+" comments.

    Basically making youtube comments into reddit.

    It has its own drawbacks, of course, but it's still an improvement.

  - u/gabbalis:

    I've... honestly never seen it. This bad comments thing. I've seen inane but funny comments peak. I've seen hilarious poe comments peak with fools replying to them assuming them to be serious.

    But I've never seen a legitimately pointless, legitimately purely hateful comment at the top of a youtube comments section.

    And frankly, sorting reddit by controversial isn't really a bad experience either. It would be nice to have both options on youtube as on reddit of course.

  I just caught up with A Hero's War and it made me wonder. Does anyone know of a book/website that is a "Guide to the Modern Era"? Containing most of the details you would need to build up an industrial civilization from scratch. It seems like it could be really interesting to read. Also, anyone who has made a real life "tech tree" civilization style. If it doesn't exist, it could be a cool variant on the "How Stuff Works" style books, as a tool to teach kids (and adults) about how the world around them works and was made.
  ```

  - u/Traiden04:
    ```
    I enjoyed "The Knowledge: How to Rebuild Our World from Scratch" by Lewis Dartnell. It is quite the primer on exactly what you are looking for, giving a good head start on building up from stone age tech to modern day.
    ```

    - u/VivaLaPandaReddit:
      ```
      That looks perfect, thanks for the recommendation!
      ```

  - u/gze:
    ```
    I've been collecting resources about that subject for a while. As Traiden04 said, Dartnell's book is exactly what you're looking for. I can also recommend The Way Things Work by C. van Amerongen. There's another version of these same set of books which you can find as How Things Work Volumes, I to IV by Roger Jean Segalat but the other one is cheaper.

    From the amazon.com description:
    > These volumes are not a reference in the ordinary sense. They have been designed, instead, to give the layman an understanding of "how things work," from the simplest mechanical functions of modern life to the most basic scientific principles and complex industrial processes that affect our well-being. The result is, we believe, a unique series - a graphic and original introduction to the modern world of technology. Here you will find the answer to the question posed by the inquisitive child who wants to know how a vacuum cleaner or refrigerator works, or by you yourself, puzzled by the complexities of lasers or the secrets of Polaroid color photography. The various subjects are shown in the list of contents, overleaf, and may prove useful for cross-reference purposes. In addition, there is a full index at the end of each volume, in which both machines and topics are listed alphabetically.



    ---------------

    Not exactly related but "mechanical thinking" has been always a weak spot of mine. I've never been good with cars or other mechanical things and someone interested in "making things from scratch" will need to get good at that kind of thinking. Here's some books I've found that will help:


    * Basic Machines and How They Work by the U.S. Navy
    * The How and Why of Mechanical Movements by Harry Walton and Ray Pioch
    * Mathematics Meets Technology by Brian Bolt
    * Making Things Move by Dustyn Roberts

    Well, XKCD has the book Thing Explainer, which covers a lot of those bases but isn't really geared towards starting from scratch. Includes completely jargon-free explanations of how stuff works from the bottom to the top. Then there's the classic [Time Traveller Poster](https://www.topatoco.com/graphics/qw-cheatsheet-print-zoom.jpg), which would likely be useful. It sounds like you're after something a bit more comprehensive though.

    Getting older, but the Whole Earth Catalogue is worth reading. Open Source Ecology is a project to redesign the basis of modern industry, and their Global Village Construction Set is pretty impressive (as is attempting home polymerisation from food waste for 3D printing).

  I'm approaching US politics as if I'm reading a rational fiction, and trying to interpret everyone's actions like that.

  I have hit a brick wall with one action though - Hillary appointing DWS as co-chair of her campaign, literally the day after revelations of collusion. What possible reason could Hillary have for doing this so soon, it looks like a terrible mistake to me.

  Obviously she was going to give something to DWS in exchange for running the DNC in her favor, and as hush-money so DWS wouldn't talk about the collusion. By why appoint her to the campaign? And if you're going to appoint her to the campaign, why the day after corruption news? It seems like such a stupid move by probably the most adept player in the game of thrones.
  ```

  - u/alexanderwales:
    ```
    Assuming that all players are playing some game of four dimensional chess at cross-purposes from each other, which is definitely not the case:

    Hillary doesn't make obvious mistakes and she doesn't make blunders. So why in the world would she do something so contrary to party unity and so blatantly corrupt? Simple: Debbie Wasserman Schultz is also a player in the game. She didn't get where she was without her own political accumen, and in fact gained her position despite ranking very unfavorably among contenders. The best thing for Hillary would be to burn DWS in effigy ... but DWS has prepared for this eventuality and made some very pointed threats which Hillary is inclined to believe that DWS would follow through on. (The nature of these threats is a matter of almost pure speculation, but it's entirely possible that DWS has "dirt" that isn't out in the open and hasn't been exposed by Wikileaks. Alternately, she might have been willing (or perceived as willing) to torch the convention to the ground and spike any chance of Hillary becoming President by simply fanning the flames of disunity on any cable television channel, all of which would be happy to play host to internal party conflict.)

    The optics are horrible for Hillary, but that indicates that the alternative would be worse.
    ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    An alternative to the others' ideas is that Hillary simply realized that the loss in votes spread out across the country would not matter compared to the concentrated loss in Florida without DWS. This state is far more in danger of turning Red than most others, and getting the Old Jewish Vote isn't a sure thing.

    As anecdotal example, most of my family/friends are voting Hillary (many with their noses very firmly pinched), but a decent amount of the extended Jewish network I'm in contact with is on the fence or pro-Trump.
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    I don't think Hillary is *actually* that adept.  I think she's become very, very good at getting out of scandals, and has convinced herself that each and every allegation against her is mere Republican propaganda.  Effectively, she's told herself she can do no wrong, so anything she does is clean and acceptable by definition.

    There's also the party-wide belief, reinforcing her behavior, that nothing to the left of wherever the Democratic Party is (and that location doesn't *really* matter) *ought* to exist.
    ```

    - u/Polycephal_Lee:
      ```
      I agree, but if she wins, that's a sort of "being the most adept."
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        If she wins in the general, yeah.
        ```

- u/electrace:

  Anyone know of any websites doing national presidential election predictions (preferably by state, as well as national result). I'm working on gathering their predictions and comparing their accuracies when the election ends.

  I need it to either be somewhat easily web scraped, or have an API, or provide historical prediction data.

  I'm already scraping PredictIt and Five Thirty Eight.

    A clever man builds a supercomputer to correctly guess the election outcome.

    A wise man simply guesses that almost every region will vote the same as they did last time, and is also correct.
    ```

    - u/electrace:
      ```
      If so, [Nate Silver will be horribly wrong.](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/)

      >Here are the chances we’ll see these election outcomes.   
      > .....  
      >Map exactly the same as in 2012: 	0.2%

      But yeah, they'll all probably have high accuracy (no real points for figuring out that California will vote Blue and Texas will vote Red). The point is in predicting the swing states correctly.

  Earlier today I was thinking and driving, when I realized that the concept of a near future post need society has a severe problem.

  The mass of unskilled labor is too great for there to be a need for innovation in agriculture.  Food costs have been much flatter than most other costs over the last thirty years or so.

  Innovation in agriculture is required to feed a post need society with minimal or no human labor.

  Expenses drive innovation.

  Expenses are kept constant by excess availability of cheap labor.  In the US this cheap labor is normally kept cheap by utilization of illegal immigrants.

  It seems to me that illegal immigration is preventing us from developing and utilizing technologies that can lead us to a post need society.
  ```

  - u/Gigapode:
    ```
    As I'm in my 3-5pm work slump, I'll take the "expenses drive innovation > agricultural labour is cheap because of illegal immigration > less innovation in agriculture" theory to be true and reply with some cached knowledge rather than think too hard about it:

    The US isn't the only place where innovation happens. In NZ for example, our primary export/industry is the dairy industry, which we know is not sustainable (fertiliser run-off, water scarcity, overseas competition etc) and rather negatively impacts our "clean and green" image thereby impacting tourism (fewer rich people come to fly-fish in our rivers for example). So a large proportion of the government's and grant organisation's science investment/funding goes towards agriculture and dairy innovation. As a result, NZ has done some of the leading research in certain aspects of the industry like twinning vaccines to produce more livestock, kiwifruit plant varieties and milking equipment as some examples. 

    So competition and challenges in particular regions can drive innovation - then areas with less drive for innovation in those industries can take advantage of it.

    You do have somewhat of a point, though all immigration, not just illegal, reduces labor costs. I think that the wage pressures of immigration will probably level off though, particularly because of remittance. If immigrants are sending money back home, then it seems likely the pressures to immigrate away from the home country will be reduced. Similar to how people freaked out about employment pressure from China, but now China's wages have risen enough that it isn't necessarily cheaper to employ there. Does that make sense? I guess the best thing would be to look at historic precedence to see how it has previously effected the economy.
