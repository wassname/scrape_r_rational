  I believe this qualifies as rational.  I'd like to get some feedback though, if someone sees where I've accidentally given the idiot ball to someone :)

  Reaction:

  After reading this, I tip my hat to your skills as a writer. You have managed to come up with something truly original in the superhero genre which have had so many different stories written for it. Yet without knowing about all possible superhero stories, I am confident that no one else came up with anything quite like your story.

  Confusion:

  [I was fairly confused about](#s " the identity of the Benefactor. It sounds like s/he is an alien who helped humanity, but then s/he includes data on seven more space fairing species (13 total) which includes Neanderthals. It sounds like Neanderthals were originally aliens who were stranded on Earth and the Benefactor was a genetic cross-breed between Cro-Magnons and Neandarthals. But there is so much information presented quickly within a few dense paragraphs that I get a little confused whether or not this is correct.")

  Typo:

  "One of the last places on Earth that man has NEVER explored." => "One of the last places on Earth that man has EVER explored."

    I think what he was saying was that 1) Neanderthals were older as a species than Homo Sapiens, 2) He was a Neanderthal made into a Kwizatz Haderach demigod by a lightning strike, 3) He had to ensure his species went extinct.

    And the Never to Ever thing is actually right as it originally was - it's never explored because they're going to die before it can be explored.

    I'll take a look at the confusing sections and see if I can clear them up a bit.  Dense data is hard to make clear.

    **EDIT**
    Some changes have been made to clarify things.  Please let me know if they are clearer.

      Thank you. It's much more clear now about the Benefactor's identity. No complaints at all.

        I only read the updated version - and had no confusion at the end. I figure the fix worked. :)

    I know of at least one story where a lightning-enhanced Homo Neanderthalensis teaches humanity skills. In that story he "just" became immortal and has a lame foot; the greek god Hephaistos, bringer of iron and smithing is that mans legend.

      Remember what the name of that story was?

        Nope, >10 years have erased it. Had I access to my fathers SF library I might be able to find it, but alas I have not.

  This was an outstandingly enjoyable read. Kudos! Do you have any other works?
  ```

    I write quite a bit.  I'll provide one link to my 'About the Author' page on my current project.  It has links to other things.  [Set In Stone: Follower](https://setinstonestory.wordpress.com/author-info/)

    That being said, most of what I write is not rational, though my current book project is.

    Warning - Set In Stone: Follower (my current project) is a serial webfiction and is not complete.  The rest of the stories on my about page are complete.

    I have not yet gotten around to cleaning up my oldest stories - the writing quality isn't quite as good in my older works, but it's not terrible either.

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      I took a look at the page you linked to. Is there any reason you choose not to include *Overseer* or did you forget?
      ```

  Really excellent short story, loved it!  I had read most of symbiote and enjoyed most of it but didn't realize you had written or were writing anything else.  I had even seen Set in Stone mentioned a few times but its not really my bailiwick but I will give it a try.

  This story is amazing with a very Arthur C. Clarke vibe to it. I actually teared up a little at the end when I considered what the benefcator had given up to protect homosapiens. 

  I do not mean to imply that the work is derivative, but it has strong echoes of Larry Niven's 'Protector' and Robert Metzger's 'Picoverse' both of which are amazing reads.

  I definitely enjoyed it, thanks!
