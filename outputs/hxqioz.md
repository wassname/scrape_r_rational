  Not heard of New Humans before. What's the sale's pitch?

    ```
    Book 1: X-Men with kids, but it's actually a cult.

    Book 2: Said kids rebel, are Waco'd. 

    Book 3: Survivors of Waco decide to become the Brotherhood of Mutants. 

    Book 4: Superhumans try to build their own micro-nation.

    Also set during the 1960s in rural Australia, after a powerful superhero stole all the nukes during the Cuban Missle Criris.
