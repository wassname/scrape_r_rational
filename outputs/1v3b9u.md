  In lieu of a description, here's an exert.

  >Dear Queen Titania,

  >Once again, I find myself watching a dear friend's life burning low, like a candle about to gutter and flicker out. I have never told you this, but I don't think you understand the impropriety of asking me to turn my friends' final moments into reports for you. I take some comfort in knowing that this pony, at least, would be delighted at the prospect of being immortalized (as they say) as a lesson. I would tell her, but she would probably try to struggle out of bed to assist in writing it.

  >I also take comfort in knowing this will be the last of these loathsome reports I shall write you.
  ```
