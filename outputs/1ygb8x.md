  Is the Achilles heal of the Bayesian detective that all one must do is act in ways that are highly improbable to foil them? Murder someone in the company of their spouse, following a visit by their inlaws? Establish an alibi that makes yourself improbable? And of course, don't post the idea to reddit...  :-)
