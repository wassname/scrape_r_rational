  I really like Garret chapters because he has such an unusual perspective that it sort of forces you to reconsider the things you take for granted. The counterpoint to that, however, is that Garrett's perspective makes events that would already be confusing or difficult to process even harder to make sense of. That's not necessarily a bad thing, I think in this case it really worked to convey the helpless confusion and despair that everyone (not just Garrett) was feeling, but it's still something to take note of.

  I don't know exactly how the Howlers worked in canon, but I really like the glimpse into their species and their psychology we get here. A whole species of glorified toddlers is absolutely terrifying, but very believable in the context of their hivemind. As a species they don't have a theory of mind. They don't think of other living beings having their own individual lives and identities because they don't think of *themselves* as having their own lives or identities. They sacrifice and maim themselves with the same willingness and glee that they murder and torture others, and I suspect the only reason we don't see more violence between Howlers is because they've already exhausted all the possibilities there.

  As for that ending... I don't even fucking know. I can't even try to make sense of it or speculate about what's happening, because it's so far out of left field that I just can't even begin to figure out how we got here. I'm definitely looking forward to the next chapter, because what the fuck is going on?

    One of the things that makes canon Animorphs so compelling... 

    ... is that things like the portrayal of the Howlers here are 100% canon. There are some more details about what the Visser figured out about their biology and stuff, but it otherwise could almost have been a rated-R recut of the original. Canon gave us *maybe* two very brief views into their murder-toddler rampages while the Reckoning has let us see it first hand in all its carnage, but it's otherwise entirely a difference of detail and not kind.

    > I don't know exactly how the Howlers worked in canon, but I really like the glimpse into their species and their psychology we get here. 

    The psychology here is pretty close to the canon version.

    The biggest difference is that, in canon, the Howlers were more of a designer species, built specifically by Crayak to destroy all life (we later learn that the Pemalites were similarly designed by the Ellimist to seed life everywhere, as part of their contest).

    Part of that design is that Crayak deliberately eliminates any Howler experiencing defeat or emotions he doesn't like, so that they don't pollute the memory pool, which is how the Animorphs defeat them in canon.

  Rachels morph vision: 

  >The walls seemed to shimmer, to flex—changing colors, changing shape, one moment flat unpolished metal, the next smooth beige plastic.  There were lights, shifting and flickering—beeps and clicks, radio voices—a viewscreen like the one on the starship Enterprise, showing—

  >Showing—

  >???

  >“—no time,” said Jake, or maybe Marco, the bodies switching places, disappearing and reappearing.  “At this rate—they’ve already—hundred Venturas—”

  >“—can’t beat them head on,” said Tobias, from the screen—no, from right beside me.  “—wasn’t for those mines, we’d already—”

  >It was different this time, I thought.  And then I realized that I was thinking—that I was thinking, the now-Rachel, the Rachel who was demorphing, who was right now in the middle of a seizure-vision, I’d never come awake during one before—

  >Marco spoke again, and it was like the voice of some nightmarish monster, ten different sentences all emerging at once, blended and overlapping and incomprehensible.  Jake answered back, and then Ax—except no, wait, Ax wasn’t here, Ax was down on Earth, and besides, he wasn’t called Ax anymore—

  >Flashes of light, blindingly bright—

  >The whole ship shook, throwing us to the floor—

  >No, wait, nothing had happened—okay, now it was happening—

  >‹Yes, or no,› thundered the voice of the Visser, from where he stood, surrounded by Marines all pointing their guns at him—no, he was on the viewscreen—both?

  >It isn’t usually like this, I thought.  Why—what—why is it all—

  >“Yes,” said Jake.

  >“Yes,” said Marco.

  >“Yes,” said Tobias, and then vanished.

  >“No, wait, stop, you can’t!”

  >The voice was Cassie’s—

  >Cassie’s?

  >She was there, where she hadn’t been, her eyes wide, her face stricken.  “You can’t,” she repeated, as Jake shouted her name, as another explosion rocked the ship, as beside me Marco raised his gun and fired—

  Vs. what actually happened: 

  >You stop the Howlers first.  You stop them now.  Then we figure out the rest, in detail, with a Leeran.  We do it slowly, no time pressure.”

  >VISSER THREE shrugged, stepped forward, held out a hand.  “Shake on it?”

  >JAKE’S arm began to rise—

  >“Stop!  You can’t!”

  >It wasn’t until after everything had already gone still and quiet that my brain was able to go back and sort it all out and figure out what had happened, and what had happened was this:

  >The air between JAKE and VISSER THREE had opened up, and two people had fallen out of it, and one of them was a little boy with soot-covered clothes and a tear-streaked face, and the other one was CASSIE.

  >JAKE and VISSER THREE had both jumped backward, and HELIUM’S tail blade had snapped into a ready position.

  >CASSIE had shouted “Stop!  You can’t!” as MARCO—

  >—the tired, dirty MARCO, the one who had brought VISSER THREE on board—

  >—MARCO had pulled a handheld DRACON BEAM out of his pocket and pointed it straight at CASSIE and his finger had been on the trigger and it had been squeezing, I hadn’t processed it in the moment but when I looked back he had definitely been trying to fire.

  >And RACHEL—

  >—who had been sitting motionless in the corner in zombie mode the whole time—

  >—RACHEL had surged forward, surged to her feet, and slammed her hand down on MARCO’S wrist, knocking the DRACON BEAM out of his hand and sending both of them tumbling to the deck in a tangled heap.

  The events are different enough to assume that they aren't the same, especially given that the timing otherwise makes no sense. This strengthens my suspicious that what Rachel saw was an Ellimist/Crayak simulation. 

  As for how Cassie returned, I couldn't guess the specifics, but if anyone could figure out how to morph after the "gate" had been closed, it would be her. Especially if she had some help from one of our godly friends. Why she chose this moment however I have no idea. What I do know is that these events were definitely manipulated for this specific outcome. And since Rachel "wasn't supposed to be there" maybe this means that Marco was supposed to successfully shoot Cassie? IDK. Looking forward to having all the answers.

    It's true to canon.  The deeper he got into the war, the more ruthless he got, and the stakes were never as, like, packaged up and presented like they are here.

  > I was running late because ██████████████

  TK17Studios, giving us the Animorphs-SCP crossover we didn't know we wanted.

  Garett censoring thoughts as part of his mental breakdown feels very much in character.

  > I want to pretend like I was listening, like in that moment I was trying to do the thing, like I was actually doing what TOBIAS had been trying to teach me, but in fact I was just hanging on.  I was just repeating them like a lullaby, like a magic spell, and when one memory ran out my brain handed me another.

  As someone who sometimes go through a bunch of catchphrases during stressful times, I can totally empathize with Garett here.

  Like, the worst thing is that even when you notice it you're in a state of mind where your brain keeps feeding you catchphrases even when you'd really like it to just STOP and BE QUIET.

  > but they were still mostly managing to press forward and then I saw ANTE press a silvery cylinder up against JAKE’S head

  Oh. Right.

  They're on a pool ship with a bunch of yeerks, who are totally fine with nabbing people and infesting them. I kind of forgot this sort of thing was possible.

  > ANTE, who was DEAD.

  Welp. Rachel warned you.

  Being a redshirt in an Animorphs story is a high turnover position.

  > “You know, I really wish you’d stop indulging in these petty fantasies, Marco.  Like the one where kicking my host actually hurts me, or the one where every little thing that goes wrong in your universe is automatically my fault—”

  Wait. We later realize that the Marco that brought V3 onboard was a V3 plant himself. Did V3 kick himself just for the fun of telling Marco that line? That is *twisted*.

  > “They won’t self-destruct, infant!  The whole point was to stop you from sending them into a war zone—they want to live.”

  I feel like Esplin might be letting some frustration seep into that remark.

  > “—is there any way to vent the pools from here?  Remotely?  Ditch Sarcaun, make room for Terra?”

  Wow.

  Flushing the yeerks was something canon!Jake only did at the very end of the canon story, that was considered an unforgiveable war crime and a proof of how ruthless the war had made him, and here r!Jake is just considering doing it for convenience, and nobody even comments on it.

  This fic gets *dark*.

  > it was JAKE, JAKE had morphed into TOBIAS, had morphed into TOBIAS to—to—to get my attention, he’d done it as just, like, a move, and it had worked, because I was a CHUMP and a RETARD and a SPAZMASTER 3000 and I had maybe never been so angry ever before in my entire life

  Well ouch.

  > “Yeah, and does that cut both ways?  What’s stopping you from doing whatever the fuck you want after we hand it over?” [...] “Says you.  How do you know that you’re even the real Visser Three, and not some clone he spun up specifically for the purpose of making promises that he himself wouldn’t be bound by?”

  Wow, Jake is *on point* in this negotiation. Basically anyone else would have let V3 bully them into accepting any terms he wanted.

  I feel like that dig must have cut a lot deeper than V3 let it on, by the way. He *knows* this is the kind of thing he'd do, and he's created more elaborate deceptions before.

  > And not only that, but I could see through things—through the clothes that JAKE and MARCO were wearing, through the outer layers of skin and fur on HELIUM and the HORK-BAJIR.  I could see the dim outlines of organs as if they were lit up by spotlights—HEARTS and LUNGS and STOMACHS and KIDNEYS—could track the ebb and flow of air, the surge of blood through veins and arteries, even an almost-invisible flicker that I thought might be the firing of nerves.

  Ooh, I forgot about the Howler's murder-vision.

  Canon Howlers were incredibly cool, especially for a one-off species that only shows up in one book plus two paragraphs of backstory in another.

  > VISSER THREE held up a finger.  “One moment,” he said.  “Terra is a unique hive-mind in the Brazilian Amazon, containing humans and animals alike, centralized around a cooperative Yeerk pool located at the confluence of the Rio Branco and the Itaquai River.”

  You were too tired to do proper opsec, and you figured Visser 3 wouldn't notice. That was a mistake. Visser 3 *always* notices sloppy opsec.

  > “Because I, too, am bored.  I am bored, and I am tired, and I have been exceptionally cooperative, and it’s time for you children to make up your minds.  I can destroy the Howlers—all of the Howlers—before they reach you or your precious little Terra.  You hand over two of the pool ships, and I will withdraw from this system and never come back.  Whatever empire I manage to create, it will treat your people kindly, according to your own definition of kindness.  But I want the cube.  Now. I should mention that I have my own Howler morph body sitting inside a holochamber at this very instant, and it would be extremely easy to, say, identify this ship in particular as the one that would be most fun to destroy, or draw an arrow toward the Amazon that doesn’t require them to notice and decode a bunch of human speech.  I will give you five minutes to make your decision.  I know you’re not exactly quick-witted, but that should be plenty, even for you, because this is not a hard call.”

  I like how *done* V3 is with the whole "taking these plucky human children seriously" thing.

  Like, he's captured both Marco and Jake, morphed them, infested them, analyzed them. They're not that special. Now he just wants to rush to the end of the storyline and build his space empire without having to negotiate with annoying unkillable kids.

  > “Magellan, you and him get the fuck out of here, right now.”

  Aaaand the controlled!Marco is still in the room.

  You know, I'm thinking the constant testing and "how do I really know you're you? you can't but you should probably assume I am anyway" back-and-forth is starting to bite them in the ass.

  Early-story Marco and Jake would have definitely checked v3!Marco for influence.

  By now I figure there's so many possible vectors of attack they've stopped trying to defend against them at all, which is starting to seriously cost them.

  > “He’s gonna want to confirm this with a Leeran.  Which means we’re going to have to get close enough that he can do pretty much whatever he wants.”

  > “So, what—we give it to him, he puts it in some kind of Faraday cage, and then he kills us?”

  > “Ten percent chance,” MARCO said.

  It's interesting here that V3!Marco steelmans the position of not dealing with V3. I wonder what poor Marco thinks of this conversation.

  I get the impression that V3 does that because he knows that's what actual!Marco would say, and he respects Jake enough to expect he'd *notice* the difference. I wonder how much of that is Marco's bias voluntarily leaking through, kind of like Alloran did.

  > “Stop!  You can’t!”

  See? Unkillable.

  > The air between JAKE and VISSER THREE had opened up, and two people had fallen out of it, and one of them was a little boy with soot-covered clothes and a tear-streaked face, and the other one was CASSIE.

  Wow. I had a lot of advance warning for that one and I'm still *super* confused.

  > And RACHEL— —who had been sitting motionless in the corner in zombie mode the whole time— —RACHEL had surged forward, surged to her feet, and slammed her hand down on MARCO’S wrist, knocking the DRACON BEAM out of his hand and sending both of them tumbling to the deck in a tangled heap.

  Proving once and for all that Rachel is MVP.

    > Wait. We later realize that the Marco that brought V3 onboard was a V3 plant himself.

    Wait what. I missed that. Is that what we infer from him drawing the dracon beam? Makes sense in hindsight, especially given the reminder that he was "the one who had brought VISSER THREE on board".
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Yup. If nothing else, you'd expect a non-captured Marco to have easier access to a handgun than to dracon beam. Getting a handgun just requires robbing a gun shop (by morphing either the owner or a rhinoceros). Getting a dracon beam requires meeting controllers, and the only ones left on Earth outside of Brazil work for V3.
      ```

      - u/holyninjaemail:
        ```
        Is that the sum total of the evidence?  Not that I'm disagreeing, but is there any other reason in the chapter we have to suppose this?
        ```

        - u/CouteauBleu:
          ```
          Well I'd say "immediately tries to shoot Cassie" counts as strong evidence too =P

          But if we want to make a list:

          - Marco immediately tries to shoot Cassie, like he was expecting her to appear. Even if a real Marco had a reason to shoot Cassie, he'd be at least shocked to see her appear.
          - Last chapter V3 alluded to controlling a large number of Marcos. We had a scene where we saw him control one while talking to US marines, and also alluding to a conversation either him or another Marco had with Tyagi and deadmanswitch!Marco, suggesting the Marco escorting Tyagi was himself hijacked (and probably Tyagi herself).
          - Marco has a Dracon beam.
          - Marco is the one who brought the V3 mouthpiece on board, which suggests contact with V3. Having contacted V3 isn't proof of being hijacked by V3, but it's strong evidence given that by this point V3 is kidnapping people left and right.

          But, I mean... this is Animorphs. The default assumption when you see someone know suddenly try to shoot one of their lifelong friend with no warning is "They got infested by a yeerk".
          ```

          - u/Quibbloboy:
            ```
            I kinda disagree - I personally think it's reasonable to assume that Marco's attitude by now is "Here's a sudden total unknown, thus it's *probably* dangerous, thus I should *probably* just shoot it now and not ask questions." Kind of like when Rachel instantly shot "Jake" without even consciously thinking about it because Garrett told her it was Visser Three.

            I mean, your theory is also perfectly plausible! There's a good chance that's exactly what happened. But personally, I'm not making it my default assumption just yet.

            ```
            Fair enough!  I didn't notice the allusions to the other Marco conversation and assumed Marco trying to shoot Cassie was set up by Ellimist/Crayak nonsense, but that makes way more sense.

  Some delayed thoughts (had to take a few days to think about the chapter):

  Current-V3 has some definite value drift from original V3; wasn't it several chapters ago (shortly before David's death) where he swore never to morph again because that put him in the realm of the gods?

  Speaking of morphing, I think I figured out how V3 is spawning V3-flesh in humans: he's using the part of the morphing tech which spawns Yeerk flesh as the control mechanism in the morph, but instead of the morph the target is now humans. To me this is again a serious deviation from his predecessor who strongly disliked the idea of being an E/C pawn. 

  It seems like the surviving V3 has 180-ed from 'Fuck you E/C I will not be your pawn' to 'I'm all about emulating the gods'. Example: there's a lot of similarities between the V3 hive mind and the Howlers, so much that he's noticing what can screw with their hive-memory and is making sure not to let that become a weakness in his, his new body's durability and structures takes inspiration from Howler biology, etc.

  A few threads back I mentioned it would be an interesting end for V3 to be reabsorbed back into Cirran. Not really possible now (and how would his hive-mind setup work in a coalescion? How would V1/4's?), but I wonder if perhaps gets reabsorbed into a different sort of coalescion - the Howler coalescion. This would actually call back very nicely to canon, where the Ellimist mentions that Crayak would see humans absorbed by the Yeerks, and then the Yeerks eventually absorbed by a superior/dominant species. I think that might be in the book where they encounter the Howlers, actually.

  The difference here is that pawns are able to be moved by both players in the E/C game, like the blue avatar from a few chapters ago. This means the Howlers are pawns of *both E/C*, not just C alone like in canon. V3 being absorbed into the Howler coalescion...well, who knows which god that would please?


  EDIT:
  Ah shit. This isn't going to end in 'ram the Blade Ship' and everyone dies, is it? Because I could see it going that way...the losing player cleans the board.

    I love hyper-detailed nitpicking and reactions.  <3 <3 <3

    I was trying to convey that Garrett knows that Eric's *limit* is 6, but doesn't know whether Eric has the same inner experience/phenomenology/reaction to getting overloaded at that point.  Maybe Eric's version of "overloaded" is different from Garrett's, and he actually e.g. just drops half the balls, or something.

    - u/strategyzrox:
      ```
      Well, there goes my hypothesis that the boy was >!David, and that Crayak had allowed the Ellimist to return Cassie because he had also been allowed to place one of his own pieces back on the board. Completely forgot about the kid Cassie brought into her morph.!<

      There comes a moment in every non-drawn chess game that one of the players realizes the game is lost, often long before the game is truly over.

       I have a strong suspicion that the very end of this chapter was that point for one of the Players. I think we just witnessed the turning point of the game.

      Alternatively, perhaps this was the merely the point at which the *length* of the game is determined. I suspect that the Ellimist's goal throughout this story has been to unite Terra with the Andalites, and that Crayak's goal has been to unite Visser 3 with the iscafil device. If Jake doesn't make the deal, they probably ultimately escape with an extremely crippled terra/fleet, but since Visser 3 is deprived of the cube, the midgame is stretched out. On the other hand, if he makes the deal with Visser 3, the animorphs have an intact Terra and a fleet to get them to the Andalites, but the Visser gets his cube, leading to an early endgame.

  >ANTE’S eyes were open, and glassy.  One of them had turned red, as if half of the blood vessels in it had burst.  His face was wrenched, twisted, frozen, his body weirdly contorted.  It looked like one of his shoulders had dislocated as he fell, as he spasmed, as all of the signals in his brain went haywire and all of his muscles contracted at once.

  Ouch, but don't beat yourself too much about it, Garrett, he's just dead, ordinary hazard in the Animorph line of work, nothing you yourself haven't gone though. Just acquire him and all he loses is a couple weeks' worth of memories, and seeing as they're memories of betraying his friends he probably won't mind all too much. That said, I'd imagine the supply of suicidal/terminally ill people has gone down quite a bit given recent events; resurrecting him seems to be a lower priority than, say, making another Marclone. 

  No idea what's gonna happen next chapter, but I can't wait to have the time travel/alternate universe/simulation thingies all explained to me.

  What the WHAT.

  I am suddenly a lot more optimistic about getting answers to my [first two questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/ggghdr/ranimorphs_request_for_theories_and_desires/fq18wzy/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).  If one or both of them have not just been answered.
  ```

- u/sharikak54:
  ```
  I just had a thought.  Can Garrett not thoughtscream only to Yeerks?
  ```

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    I don't know, as the author.

    My guess is "no," since Yeerks embed themselves on a neuron-by-neuron level with the brain, so there's not really like a separate entity to influence?

    But I feel like one could rationalize it the other way, too, like the thought-speak is at "human frequencies" or whatever.  Hard to say what those are, though.
    ```

    - u/Quibbloboy:
      ```
      I disagree, as a reader.

      My guess is "*yes*." (Is it hubris to disagree with the author himself on mechanical debates? Lol.) There's definitely a separate metaphysical entity to influence, since Yeerks have thoughts and feelings and a "self" completely separate from the host. Like, it's more debatable in Andalite-Controllers or collaborators or whatever, where they do their little fusion dance thing and the boundary breaks down. But in humans, where that doesn't happen, there's always a clear line separating the two - there's always a unique mind that's *purely* Yeerk, and sits on a level above the human one, separate from it, with secrets and walled-off thoughts.

      I'd submit that thought-speak works finely enough to distinguish one mind from another, even if the physical bodies are glued together. The level of arbitrary control the Animorphs are able to exert over who they target seems to indicate as much, anyway. Heck, in theory, couldn't they just target the physical location containing the Yeerk neurons that process all its Yeerk-specific thoughts?

      Anyway.
      ```

      - u/TK17Studios:
        ```
        It is not hubris.
        ```

      - u/sharikak54:
        ```
        So, my issue is that if Yeerks can be separately thoughtscreamed to, why is Garrett’s default not to scream to every Yeerk in the vicinity (excluding morphed friends maybe, so he still needs those eg Jake-shaped holes)?  That way he wouldn’t have chanced Ante’s death.  By now the Animorphs must have tested this, right?  And that would be an amazing weapon, even if it kills morphers’ control Yeerks, since the nanotech or whatever for targeting is still there so they can still demorph.  They would have an AOE disable-all-Yeerks spell, which is kind of OP.

        So anyway I think in-story the answer has to be “no”, at this point.  Even though I think “yes” makes more sense, personally.

          Doesn't Rachel's issue come from her having dead/inactive control tissue still integrated into her brain? I get the feeling that if Garrett were to try knocking out a yeerk while it's still in someone's head, it won't turn out well for the host.

          *That* makes a *ton* of sense. I was so preoccupied with whether or not he *could*...

          [Well. You know the rest.](https://jrlburke.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/could-should.jpg)

          But yeah, you're absolutely right.

  > “I humbly submit to you that there are a lot of good things you can only get if you’re the kind of person who can actually keep a promise.”

  Yeah, well, there are also a lot of good things you can only get if you're able to break promises. Like, in a one-shot prisoner's dilemma, you don't want to cooperate unconditionally, you want to... I think it's "cooperate iff the other player will cooperate iff you cooperate". Here I think he wants to keep his promise iff he gets good things iff he keeps his promise. This isn't necessarily single-shot, but it might be? E.g. if no one will be around to tell that he broke his promise.

  (And it's not like we haven't seen him lying before, which isn't the same as breaking promises but is in the same ballpark.)

  I absolutely believe Visser 3 is capable of making unbreakable vows, but (like the Animorphs) I'm not convinced this is him doing so.

  (Or, like. HPMOR-style unbreakable vows might not be a thing he's willing to do, they might be too close to changing identity. But something like that.)

  I'm, I guess a little suspicious of how everything seems to be revolving around the cube. V3 seems to be willing to sacrifice a lot for it - if he'd really leave Earth alone (which, again, *doubt*, but if) that's billions of hosts. There are other cubes, and he has a body on the andalite homeworld, so it doesn't seem that unlikely he'd be able to get one. But if he doesn't care that much about it, why hasn't he killed the animorphs? I could believe he cares about it enough to let them live, but not enough to let earth go, but... I dunno, feels like I'm missing something.

But there have been a number of—let’s call them *coincidences,* which you have no doubt noticed, and there is a certain plodding obviousness to the presence of a uniquely precious item in your little army’s inventory.”

  That was rather intense. Loved it as always, gonna need another read through to pick up on everything. Thanks for writing this!

  Edit: one parallel I hadn't really clocked before was the similarity between Howlers and Visser 3 as hive minds, I guess it didn't register for me before I saw Garrett describe being a Howler

  hey everyone, this isn't related to the current release but I was hoping to get some help from you all. I stopped reading this story a while ago and due to how the chapters are structured I'm having a hard time finding where I left off. last main story beat I remember wasn't long after an assault on a yerk base. I vaguely remember one of the kids turning into a whale at one point as well. 

  Sorry if thats not very specific but I was hoping someone could point out general chapter window around then so I can pick up the story again.

  Thanks!

  - u/TK17Studios:
    ```
    Assault on the Yeerk base was chapters 7 and 8.

    Tobias (and Garrett) turning into whales was chapter 11 (#12 on the online versions because they also count the interludes as chapters).

      heck yeah thank you! Didn't realize I had that much catching up to do, looking forward to it.

  AHHH Cassie!!!! Man if this is the real Cassie (and it seems like it is) then man, what a fake out because after this long without her being resurrected I was sure she was going to stay dead. Can't wait for her chapter up next. I was wondering how the plot has suffered from her absence as one of the chosen 4 but it makes sense that she was saved somehow. 

  I recently reread the entire story and I'm so thankful I did because there is a lot to unpack and understand. It's been interesting connecting the canon plot to this fic as I've never fully read the entire series. Thankfully I do remember the Howler side plot and your depiction of them is just as wonderful as they were in canon.

  Stuff happening fast. 
  How would Garrett know that Ante is truly dead?
  A Finn dying by an autist screeching "Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!"? Would go against the spirit of Sisu.
  Doubtful.

  Late to the party here but I want to provide the obvious idea that this action from cassie was somehow intentional on her part. Perhaps she was given access to a control terminal for the simulation, ie the time matrix. Tough to think of her not intervening sooner though. Looking forward to the next chapter.
  ```

  Finally got around to reading. Yay, a Garrett chapter! Poor Garrett :(

  Like, poor Garrett because of the Ante thing and the Tobias thing, but mostly because he's just having a really, really, really bad day. When he activated his Super, that was genuinely pretty shocking.

  Y'know, there are devices that can transmit thought-speak, obviously. I can't imagine it would be *that* hard to, like, tune one of those to transmit at lethal volumes and form a portable orb of murder. Maybe fly it around on a little drone slow enough to mess up your target, or just, like, everyone. And what are the rules for long-range thought-speak again? The recipient has to be plugged into a long-range thought-speak receiver, right? If those things just, like, write down your "words" and transmit a copy of them to the receiver, then you might get bottlenecked by the throughput of the device. But if they transmit your thought-speak directly, with no data limit or whatever, you could pretty much kill anyone with a receiver at any time. (Except maybe an Andalite. Garrett thought-screamed into Ax's eib when it was *Ax's* turn to fray, and it only soothed him.)

  At the beginning of the chapter, when Garrett is watching Rachel through the cameras, the timeline is very slightly different than it was in Chapter 43. The obvious thing is that the Howler thumbsed-up instead of waving, but then there's also some minor Rachel curling up/laying down/standing up stuff that's more nitpicky. Is that a TKSU (like the KASUs from canon - anyone else remember the Anibase?) or is it some sort of clue? As the author himself said in the author's notes for Chapter 7, "*Sometimes a continuity error is a continuity error, and sometimes it's plot.*"

  Getting Megamorphs #4 vibes from the end of this one. Like, in terminal endgame stages, amid action and gore and Dracon fire, everything coming to a head, formerly-dead Cassie materializes out of nowhere on the bridge of an Animorph-controlled Yeerk ship, and the air tastes like Ellimist. Again, I can't tell if it's a happy accident or an intentional callback - or if, like, it was coincidentally where the story was going anyway, and /u/TK17Studios kinda leaned into it, too.

  So, Cassie's alive. Or "alive," or something. This is one of those rare moments that I actually very slightly regret following along in the comments as chapters got posted; there have been hints about this development for - oh god - years, now? Not to mention the cryptic release schedule from the Author's Notes of 44, and the Author's Note at the beginning of *this* chapter. I can't even imagine the *WHAM* of this moment if it hadn't been for the low-key spoilers that have been leaking out about it, lulz.

  Can't wait for more!

    Yes.  I can't believe you're the first one to point it out, but thanks for pointing it out.  Updated in the Ao3 version.

  I originally opened this thread from utter boredom eleven days ago, and it piqued my interest to the point I've binge-read the entire story—literally caught up just now and immediately went back to this thread. (To be fair, it was not *just* the thread; this story had been recommended to me many, many times before, and the discussion there was a *tipping point* of sorts.)

  So. Wow. What a ride. I'll probably put some thoughts on meta-aspects I liked and disliked after the story is finished—since this event is bound to happen very soon (unfortunately!).

  One thing I **need** to say is that I sincerely hope to see the original plans for this story—I know some significant changes to the future plot were done in the middle of writing, and I wonder what we would've gotten if everything stayed as planned originally. Omake? A post on this subreddit? Anything, pls.

  One thing I adored in the last two chapters is the sheer petty bullshit Visser Three was up to. My favorite kind of character is "intelligent and driven but utterly psychopathic," and so, naturally, I absolutely love Esplin (in the earlier chapters) and V3 (now). Before we mostly got him as the Big Bad, and almost every single line, every single scene was extremely plot-relevant and significant and had, uh, a scale? In a sense that whatever he did, it was capital-B Bad, and now it's only lowercase-b bad, and it feels really fresh, you know? I mean, there's a difference between "blowing up half a billion people" and "kicking yourself and then snarking about that to keep up the charade for a little longer," and the second one is *much less expected*—and thus more interesting. ...Oh wow, I'm rambling.

  Aaaanyway, I really enjoy this story. I'm not good at writing theories right now because it's 5 am (no points for guessing why I'm up at 5 am), but I'm really looking forward to the next update, whether it's an interlude or a full-fledged chapter. While Cassie's is obviously going to be interesting, I've been looking forward to Tobias's chapter for the last, like... eleven parts (since it was eleven parts ago when we last saw him).

  Keep up the good work!
  ```

  - u/NTaya:
    ```
    Oh, one other random thought, also involving Tobias, is that I feel like each of the four—maybe even six, counting Rachel and Garrett—OG Animorphs have some kind of a *believably superhuman* ability. In a sense that neither me nor, likely, anyone else in the thread is going to meet such a person IRL, but the suspension of disbelief is not yet broken.

    Jake has the little black box, Marco can intuit when shit's about to go down, Cassie knows her animals really well and has a deeper kinship with the morphing system than anyone else... But I don't really get what is Tobias's thing. I tried to think about it, but honestly, Tobias comes off—at least to me—as Marco v. 0.5. (This is going to be one of the things I address in my meta-thoughts post after the story is finished, tbh.)

    Either way, thanks for writing this cool story again!

  This chapter in particular helped me kind of understand what I’ve been doing in my life and that is loving the story I have been telling myself. This and the next chapter really has been driving home for me that I need to work on not taking reality for granted. Thanks heaps for that and also for keeping me entertained with this story over the past couple of months.
