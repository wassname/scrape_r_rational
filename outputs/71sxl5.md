  Back from an unplanned hiatus on the main story.  I did a lot of physics and planetary science research and it turns out that the answer to a central, plot relevant question is not known, but is likely to be answered by either the Europa Clipper mission or the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, both scheduled for launch in the 2020s.

    I didn't want to wait that long to finish The Maker's Ark, so I had to make a choice and hope I'm not embarrassingly wrong.  We'll see. 8-)

    A warm welcome back, and as someone who has both lost at least a few hours of brain cycles  trying to set up the problem (and what to neglect), and is audacious enough to ask: will you please include your own thoughts as to the variables needed of it is plot relevant, or just, please, put out what variables (tensor fields really)  you think you need to set up the problem as an authors note.

    The really hard point for me way when I realized I'd need to at least guesstimate the gravitational flux Journeyman's wards could take, back calculate that through the variance of on Europs and kth based on flicker duping ,m-n entropy into into a region to collect so much mass into a portal. . .   well its an optimization problem where minimizing the height of mass on Europa at least eliminates one additional variable where several interacting dependent variables are tensor fields.   [comment pre-edited to remove rambling on trying to at least isolate n for how many co-dependent or independent variables are in the problem before I started drinking, because it's an interesting irrelevant problem . . .] 

    Yeah please give us your broad strokes I don't think it needs to be presentable or accurate, this is a very hard problem, that, probably is within baseline human understanding, after a lot of calculation and error checking, within a few 0-n*hundred man months, and the people who actually think about the math will really appreciate hearing your thought process, though optimizing the mass distribution and associated thermal conductivity on Europa is a great idea and a similarly hard optimization problem.

  Why did she have to smooth over the whole planet? Why not just make a single groove around the equator?

    Maybe something like she doesn't want to melt it while actually using it so she needs to vary her path enough to not be focusing the heat in one place.

      She needs to elude at least x mass above into a point probably through a portal, so it doesn't eat all of Europa.  It's a break out the scotch complex problem to even set up, I see why she went into deep time, me I'm just getting schnockered and letting myself indulge in bad skinner box games to get it out of my head, especeially as the mass stream need to be at least constant within k-h bounds for the gravity flux going through the portals to not squish Journeyman, though I'm getting the hint the floaters might be offering artificial portal services with the equivalent of a google translate set of terms and conditions from a race that has had Bank's Behemothaurs's time to refine bureaucracy and existential risk mitiation.

      That and she's going to be removing matter from the surface for the black hole. Don't want to do too much of that in the same area.  She also needs to remove major obstacles that might prevent the water from spreading out evenly (There are a lot of long, low ridges on Europa).
