  I know this is going to be extremely difficult to face, but you appear to be posting word salad.  If you are on drugs, and I am asking you this for your own good, *please stop*.  If you are not on drugs, please, again, for your own good, *please* see a psychiatrist.

  If you are remotely capable of comprehending Hutter's work when you're brought back to reality, then there is *far* too much excitement in store for you to let this illness take your mind away from you.

  Please, see a doctor.  It will be hard, especially because some of the things you'll say will sound insane *besides* the word-salad.  But word salad is a symptom of severely life-impacting schizophrenia, or some other form of psychotic breakdown.

  Please, *please* see a doctor.

  Aw, damnit, reading the comments ruins this.  I thought at first that "Here's how to recursively self-improve (this isn't fiction, but I like you guys): [removed]" was an extremely short rationalist horror story.

    Haha. That would certainly be one possibility. Indeed, by writing this you have proved its existence to me. Interesting.
