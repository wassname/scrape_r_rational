Welcome to the Monday request and recommendation thread. Are you looking something to scratch an itch? Post a comment stating your request! Did you just read something that really hit the spot, "rational" or otherwise? Post a comment recommending it! Note that you are welcome (and encouraged) to post recommendations directly to the subreddit, so long as you think they more or less fit the criteria on the sidebar or your understanding of this community, but this thread is much more loose about whether or not things "belong". Still, if you're looking for beginner recommendations, perhaps [take a look at the wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki)?

If you see someone making a top level post asking for recommendation, kindly direct them to the existence of these threads.

  You know what I'm hoping to find every time I open this thread's weekly incarnation? A good Naruto fanfiction I haven't read yet. Yeah, I'm that kind of person.

  So, here are my favorite Naruto fanfics. They're all old, and often incomplete, and I'm sure all the Naruto fans here have already read them all. Ah well.

  &#x200B;

  [The Need to Become Stronger](https://needtobecomestronger.wordpress.com/2016/10/12/the-need-to-become-stronger/)

  Rationalist re-telling of the original story with major divergences; mystery intended to be solvable by the reader. Most likely dead.

  [Black Cloaks, Red Clouds](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8654967/1/Black-Cloaks-Red-Clouds)

  Orochimaru is Hokage and has remade Konohagakure in his image; Tenten MC. Definitely dead.

  [The Howling Wind](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8550403/1/THW)

  Naruto can only use wind chakra. Brutal, Lovecraftian AU. Dead as a doornail.

  [Time Braid](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5193644/1/Time-Braid)

  Sakura is stuck in a time loop. Progression fantasy, slight cross-over with Oh My Goddess. Complete!

  [Indomitable](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5207262/1/Indomitable)

  [Walk on the Moon](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10779196/1/Walk-on-the-Moon)

  Initially sociopathic self-insert is reborn as a Yamanaka. Probably dead.

  [Sasuke Uchiha and the Power of Lies](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13472966/1/Sasuke-Uchiha-and-the-Power-of-Lies)

  "Welcome to Konoha, where existence is confusing, everyone is happy, and we all serve our benevolent God-King." Crack. Complete!

    The problem is all of them are dead. 

    Case13's [Reload](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4203131/1/Reload). Sasuke and Naruto on their last time loop. 100% awesome, 100% dead. 

    [Naruto Genkyoien](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4730390/1/Naruto-Genkyouien) 

     The Nine-tails turns out to be a young kitsune who got her tails tails by luck and didn't know any better. And she starts clinging onto Naruto like an older brother. And then her family comes into town. Complete. Basically a crack fic with many moments of awesome & heartwarming.

    > "She can be my nin-fox," Naruto gleefully suggested. "Like the Inuzuka's dogs. Sure, those dogs can't invoke the white flame of destruction that incinerates heaven and sunders the earth to ashes, but nobody's perfect."

    [The Empty Cage](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7305950/1/The-Empty-Cage)

    Naruto died when the sealing occurred, so the Nine-tails gotta keep up the masquerade to stay in the human world to find his siblings. Dead. 

    [People Lie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3745099/1/People-Lie)

    Liked this one as a kid but a little too Dunning–Kruger now. Still, originated some neat ideas. Too bad it's dead.

    Any love for [Hear the Silence](https://archiveofourown.org/works/15406896/chapters/35757684)? You've probably already heard about it, but it is a slow paced (and slowly written) SI OC in Minato's generation. 

    Not OP MC,or not in the normal way, focused on societal issues, ninja trauma and personal relationships.  And currently the fic with the most kudos on ao3 in the naruto fandom. Or it was, I don't know about now.

    You may also like the quest [Crusader Kages](https://forums.sufficientvelocity.com/threads/crusader-kages-a-naruto-village-councilor-quest.111126/), though it is currently on semi-hiatus. In it, you're the Learning Advisor on the small village Hoshigakure.

    > Time Braid

    There's a micro-genre of stories in which the protagonist is caught in a time loop, and one month from the beginning of the loop there's a surprise invasion of their city, led by some ridiculously powerful person who is nigh-unkillable and can (to some extent) raise the dead. The protagonist must gradually progress to the point where they're not cannon fodder. Time Braid matches this description, as does Mother of Learning (and Chunin Exam Day, which inspired Time Braid, but I don't recommend it).

    Are there any other entries in this weirdly specific genre? Or similar things?

      [Wish Upon A Sin](https://archiveofourown.org/works/33406855/chapters/82980448) is a Re:Zero fanfiction that fits almost perfectly. Unlike the anime, there are no arbitrarily updating save points. Subaru is sent back to the start everytime he dies . >!And there's a major witch cult attack on the city within a few months if he does nothing.!< It's a good entry to the micro-genre and it feels like it was partially inspired by Mother of Learning. Still updating, slowly.

    Let's see what the old memory digs up... These are all dead from what I can recall, but they stood out enough that I feel like there's a good chance you may enjoy them.

    \- [Sanitize](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12431866/1/Sanitize)

    Warring clans, a reincarnated doctor learning how to survive in this era.

    \- [A Drop of Poison](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4573620/1/A-Drop-of-Poison)

    I wouldn't call this story particularly rational, it is however quite fun and does actually do things that are surprisingly rare in the Naruto fandom, like actual spying and information gathering, crazy I know.

    \- [The Mouse of Konoha](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6693171/1/The-Mouse-of-Konoha)

    There was some post about AI or something figuring out the plot twist or ending to The Need to Become Stronger, but the author never posted what it was, just that it happened.


    Haven’t reread it in ages but I remember being pissed because I don’t generally try to “solve” or predict stories, I’m more of a “holy shit and THAT was what that was” post-reveal/ending reader. Any of that ringing a bell to you? Do you have any theories for where the story was going? 


    Might need to scrounge up links to whatever BS I’m talking about so I don’t look crazy now 😂


    Edit: And also a rec, so I don’t leave you with nothing this week; I quite enjoyed [Any Port in a Storm](https://archiveofourown.org/works/5384075/chapters/12435455).

      Hey! Yeah I remember [that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/lvn6ow/gpt3_just_figured_out_the_entire_mystery_plot_of/) by the author, u/Sophronius. When GPT4 became publicly available [I tried to get it to complete the story](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/11th4hs/comment/jcmx4zh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but the context window obviously isn't big enough to copy/paste the whole story, and current LLMs, even GPT4, get confused after multiple prompts. The author [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/11th4hs/comment/jcoi2fg/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), saying that GPT3 had only correctly guessed the mystery once, so it wasn't quite as impressive as he initially believed.

      I couldn't say where the story was going, myself. My impression is that Sophronius was immensely disappointed that people didn't theorize more about where his story was going, and I get that, but I do think there weren't quite enough hints to do any *real* theorizing, as opposed to mostly random speculation.

      That said, I'll speculate a bit here. Mild spoilers ahead.

      If you put a gun to my head and forced me to guess who the Enemy is, I would say Jiraiya.

      First, the story puts a lot on emphasis on how the most important skill for a ninja is to stay *hidden*, and no S-rank ninja avoids suspicion more than the goofy, drunken, perverted godfather of Naruto.

      Second, Jiraiya is always absent when the Enemy makes their moves. This is hypothesized by Naruto to be because the Enemy's plans are obviously more likely to succeed if Jiraiya isn't around, but if Jiraiya is such a big deterrent, you'd expect the Enemy to have made a move against him by now. The Enemy wasn't afraid of taking on Minato and Sarutobi, after all.

      Third, NtBS Jiraiya is not an idiot, which means all of his apparently stupid actions have to be re-interpreted accordingly. For example, he made the 'foolish' move of lending the Scroll of Forbidden Seals to Naruto, and 'forgot' to remove the page about the Reaper Death Seal until after Naruto read its summary, thereby making sure Naruto knew about it, and where it could be found. There are more examples IIRC, I'd have to read the story again.

      Fourth, Jiraiya's stated goal is world peace, and yet he doesn't *seem* to be doing much to bring that about. Which has to mean he is doing something out of sight.

      Fifth, a *lot* of Naruto's beliefs about the Enemy come from... none other than Jiraiya himself. Minato's letter to Naruto was given to him by Jiraiya! Was that letter even really written by Minato?

      Finally, remember that the central revelation about chakra and the shinobi arts in NtBS is that the only real prerequisite to cast a jutsu is *understanding*. Anyone who knows how can use the Bringer of Darkess technique. Anyone with the knowledge can use telepathy like the Yamanaka, control minds with Kotoamatsukami, influence tailed beasts with genjutsu, and do everything the Enemy has done.

      (If I could wave a magic wand and bring one story back from the dead, I'd pick The Need to Become Stronger without hesitation.)

  This is wildly different from what is typically shared here, but I'd like to rec the comedy/drama TV series Mrs. Davis (available on peacock, which may limit the audience.) There are 8 one-hour episodes. [Here's the trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIOnrEujKl8)

  It's really hard to describe without spoilers, but it features a pretty interesting take on a rogue AI.  The AI is flawed in ways that are far more subtle than the standard "paperclip maximizer" problems.  So much so that I think a lot of people really would have no problems with it if it existed IRL.

  The show also has a fun mystery element.  It's not the kind you can solve on your own, but still pretty satisfying.  Many elements that might seem like plotholes or inconsistencies turn out to have explanations.

  I love the humor, but that's probably going to be hit or miss for a lot of you.
  ```

  - u/GlueBoy:
    ```
    Not that different, actually. TV show recs are uncommon but not unheard of, and Lindelof is consistent in both novelty and genre appeal. I distinctly remember seeing both Watchmen and The Leftovers being recommended here at one time or another.

    First episode was great, thanks for the rec.
    ```

  - u/OutOfNiceUsernames:
    ```
    De-rec from me on this one. Or, rather, if you find yourself unimpressed with the series' theme and spirit by the end of episode ~03, I'd suggest maybe sticking around to see ep04 as well, and then dropping if it was still mostly underwhelming to you.

    >It's really hard to describe without spoilers

    It felt to me like a whackier, crackier mix of [*Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect) and, in some places, [*Dark Skies.*](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/32807) One that (at times) used elements of postmodernism to hide or excuse its bad writing tropes and lack of originality.

    ---

    Maybe try watching [*The OA*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635282/) as something with somewhat similar vibes to this show, though I'm not sure I'd call the latter rational either.

  Player Manager is not rational and at first blush looks trashy (Sports LitRPG, really?), but it’s been my favorite RR serial lately. There’s a uniquely visceral energy, enthusiasm, and vitality running through the whole thing that makes it a joy. The humor hits, and it got me to care about soccer which I never have before. The first book is going on Kindle soon so now is the time to binge it or grab an epub copy if you’re interested.

  - u/meangreenking:
    ```
    Player Manager is well written, wonderfully witty, and unique in all the system powered stuff I've read, I would heavily recommend it with a single caveat.

    It deals with the MC being OP by giving him an actual meaningful weakness, which makes for a much more engaging story then the usual RR power fantasy.

    However, this weakness is that the MC has a massive anger management problem and a massive ego. Its heavily implied it isn't his fault, but at a certain point I really wanted the dude to just shut up and not have a ego the size of the moon enough that I stopped reading.
    ```

    - u/Gold_To_Lead:
      ```
      Yes, that’s definitely fair. I find it refreshing bc most RR stories have characters with “default personalities” which gets really bland, whereas Max has a charisma that draws me in. His ego makes it entertaining :) but now that I think of it I might have greater tolerance for this than most; I got up to two-thousand something chapters of I Really Am A Superstar, which is 500% worse in that regard lol

      You'd have to slog through some low points (i.e. all the parts where the protag acts mopey and self-pitying) to get to some pretty awesome moments with good payoffs.

      I'd recc the story as well, but the problem is that while the author writes great payoffs and great awesome moments, he's also a little inconsistent and has a number of story beats that just end up falling flat (e.g. shoe, MUNDIAL, the whole Ian Evans feud).

  **REQUEST**:    
  I'm not a fan of the "loner sociopath munckinning your favorite franchise" school of Rationalist Fiction

  What I really want out of rationalist fiction is original fiction with sensible characters.  What can people suggest with sensible heroes who are actually people with relationships and who aren't 100% certain they can Take over the World?

  **RECCOMENDATIONS**:    
  **Super Supportive** is starting to get some traction here.    
  I haven't heard anyone talk about **Budding Scientist in a Fantasy World**...it is Slice of Life LitRPG Isekai where the MC tries to figure out what the System is and how it works.  Definitely Rationalist Fiction by the narrowest definition.    
  **Apocalypse Parenting** is only Rationalist Fiction adjacent, but depending on what drew you to the subgenre you might like it.  It is System Apocalypse deconstruction where people don't all act like lunatics or video game characters and where some people actually work together.

      Ah, where’s Dragon_God when you need him?

      I’ve seen this in Pokémon fanfic and Naruto.

      It’s practically an entire genre within Harry Potter fandom. Anything where a dark, tortured Harry gets [foreknowledge](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8149841/1/Again-and-Again) or [the powers of ancient magic](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8175132/1/Jamie-Evans-and-Fate-s-Fool) or [both](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/4068153/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Wastelands-of-Time). *Ender’s Game* but played straight is also [popular](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/8379655/1/Hogwarts-Battle-School). [Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches](https://m.fanfiction.net/s/11574569/1/Dodging-Prison-and-Stealing-Witches-Revenge-is-Best-Served-Raw) goes so far into this territory that it wraps around and becomes a harem. Okay, perhaps these aren’t exactly “rational.” Maybe even HPMOR counts, at least to the Quirrel stans.

      I think it would be a fair descriptor for some of the more meta xianxia, too. A sufficiently genre-savvy narrator is indistinguishable from an SI!

        Most of your examples don't have sociopath protagonists.

        "Again and Again" is a slash HP/LV fic. Aside from copious bashing of the characters the author doesn't like (which is fairly standard for amateur fic in the Harry Potter fandom), that rendition of Harry doesn't act like a sociopath because he has a normal capacity for empathy and emotional bonds with people who aren't his enemies.

        Similar deal with "Harry Potter and the Wastelands of Time": that rendition of Harry has normal capacity for empathy, and in fact the story revolves around his emotional bonds to the people who are important to him.

        "Dodging Prison and Stealing Witches", on the other hand, is a fic routinely derided for it's blatant harem-building pedophilia. Aside from the author and reader's obvious predilections, I really wonder why you thought this and your other linked examples were relevant.

          Good point on A+A. Wait, is it the one where he and Grindelwald fight Dumbledore at the end? Or is that Jamie Evans?

          I remember wastelands as being pretty sociopathic to anyone who wasn't sleeping with Harry. Could be mixing it up with any of the other "Harry has seen some shit" fics, though.

          As for DP+SW...well, the OP didn't ask for recs, but examples. I dropped that one after the first mention of aging potions. Sounds like it gets worse? Anyway, the first little part of the story is so stupid and self-serious that it's fun. And that includes Harry being sociopathic as hell.

    De-rec on Budding Scientist. 

    I found the protagonist... problematic. She's supposed to be a young teenage girl but her behavior is all over the place maturity/intelligence-wise and she generally takes herself far too seriously. Characters taking themselves seriously isn't bad, but the author also takes her seriously and this makes it a bit goofy to read. 

    Generally, it feels to me like the platonic embodiment of Dunning–Kruger where the protagonist, and by extension the author, posits some scientific theories that they half-understand at a highschool level and then pat themselves on the back for having solved the riddle (eg "magic mana particles obviously act just like electrons!!" or whatever) that the stupid, science-lacking fantasy world magic people could never understand, because their collective society across all of their history lacks the big-brain energy that some random Isekai teenage schmuck has. 

    Also, who tf uses "Budding" as an adjective to describe young girls? When I see that, my internal red-flag system goes on alert, just as it would if I encountered someone who only calls women "females".

      Re-rec. Her characterization is often quite "I am very intelligent meme" for the first three hundred pages, but even before the character writing gets better the author doesn't make the usual mistake and trivialize the intellectual challenges she's facing. (Well, at least not more than is necessary for there to be an entertaining story centered on a single person making lots of important discoveries in a few years, as the audience tends to expect in stories about fictional science.)

      Also, your internal red-flag system is way oversensitive in this case. The author is very respectful to the females.^(joke)

      I mean, I can see a little of that, but honestly 97% of Rationalist fiction seems to do that so much more than this one. The author explicitly DOESN'T do the "Mana must be particles" thing (which I hate).

      I was just psyched to have a "scientific" take that paid at least some attention to the Scientific Method, and rationalist take that didn't have a sociopath or murder hobo MC.

  In particular >!Joan realising that she needed to get the attention of the actress who played her was just.... chef's kiss!<

    Huh. I had an opposite reaction. I haven't rewatched the past seasons, so maybe I've built it up too much in my mind, but this felt like one of the weakest episodes in a while. The underlying premise was a good one, but the execution and the details all felt off and cheap, like it was the laziest way of executing on a promising idea. I wouldn't go so far as to call it bad, but I was disappointed relative to what I've come to expect from Black Mirror.

    I also liked it a lot and thought of this sub, mostly because of that one qntm story.

  any recommendations for wuxia?

    I’ve heard good things about Ze Tian Ji, Legend of the Condor Heroes, and King Shura. I think they were a little slow for my tastes, though.

      Seconding Ze Tian Ji / Way of Choices. 

      From what I understand, *Legend of the Condor Heroes* is pretty much *the* OG wuxia. Basically what *Lord of the Rings* is to western fantasy. Probably worth checking out, if nothing else.

    Yongbi is Korean and pretty old at this point and it's closer to French/Belgian comics than to manga, but it's really good. Gosu is by the same author and it's good too although I haven't finished it. 

    There's a bunch of of murim/wuxia webtoons on Reaper/Flame/Asura/Zero/Realm scans which you've probably read already. My favorites are Murim Login, I Reincarnated as a Legendary Surgeon, Fist Demon of Mount Hua, and Heavenly Grand Archive's Young Master, but I've read everything with that tag that I could find.

    Last week's Recommendation Thread was full of them. Try looking through that.

      you're thinking of xianxia

        I probably am lmao. What’s the difference again?

          Wuxia is more grounded, usually only slightly fatastical, with the fantasy elements being more "martial arts masters are a bit super human", Xianxia is full fantasy with dragons and gods and magic, usually. Kung fu panda (ignoring the fantasy of animal anthropomorphism) vs. Dragon ball Z/Naruto, to use popular franchises.
          ```

          - u/chiruochiba:
            ```
            The literal translation of "Wuxia" is "martial heroes." *Kung Fu Panda* is technically a wuxia film because it is focused on martial arts, but more typical examples would be *[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crouching_Tiger,_Hidden_Dragon)*, *[Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_(2002_film\))* or the eponymous *[Wuxia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_(2011_film\))*.

            Xianxia literally translates to "immortal heroes." The defining element of the genre is that the powerful humans in the story improve their minds and bodies to superhuman levels by physically/spiritually cultivating their immortality, usually by doing a lot of meditation. Thus, xianxia novels are often called "cultivation novels" by English speaking fans. Neither of your examples are xianxia.

            - u/GrizzlyTrees:
              ```
              You're right about the xianxia examples, I've gotten too used to explaining progression fantasy rather than xianxia, and mixed my examples. I don't actually know if any mainstream examples exist.
              ```

              - u/chiruochiba:
                ```
                The most mainstream example I can think of is [Mo Dao Zu Shi (Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmaster_of_Demonic_Cultivation) which has a huge following in the US to the extent that it reached #1 on the Barnes & Noble Bestsellers list and also made it onto the The New York Times Best Seller list. It also got an [anime adapation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_Dao_Zu_Shi) that lasted 3 seasons and 35 episodes. That said, it's a boy's love story rather than focused on min-max munchkinry, so the average member of r/rational might not be familiar with it.
                ```

        - u/degenerate__weeb:
          ```
          tl;dr:  
          Wuxia = Martial heroes. Think Dynasty Warriors (video games).  
          Xianxia = Immortal heroes. Warrior monks meditating to gather power, then sling magical powers around.

          Even MORE tl;dr would be low vs high chinese fantasy.
          ```

          It's kind of like the difference between Zorro stories and Brandon Sanderson.
          ```

- u/CaramilkThief:
  ```
  [Dark Lord of the Farmstead](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/68630/dark-lord-of-the-farmstead-a-slice-of-life-litrpg) is about a person isekaid into the Dark Lord, who promptly fucks off because the Dark Lord has done horrific things and he wants a life away from that. He finds a nice village to settle down at as a Farmer, with a pretend-wife and an adopted child and a really egregious Stardew Valley-esque system. Basically Spy x Family happening in a high fantasy world. Very wholesome obviously, and well enough written to be enjoyable. It feels like the story kinda speedruns getting a family, and the chemistry between the protagonist and Narya feels rushed. But both of them also feel that and think deeply on it, which feels realistic. Overall I'd recommend.
  ```

- u/EtheusProm:
  ```
  Please recommend me something with a painfully sane, self-aware, borderline sociopathic MC, akin to those from HPMOR and Mother of Learning.  

  I keep asking this same question and keep getting bad  recommendations. Here's attempt #3!  

  Started *Worth the candle* - there's not an ounce of rationality in it, the MC is a bumbling fool stumbling upon adventures and achieving lucky resolutions due to nothing but his thick plot armor. Dropped it 52% in and really shouldn't have given it that much time to prove itself.  

  Started *Only Villains Do That* and it doesn't live up to its name, it's basically management porn in a gacha world. The author explained numerous times that his goal was to make an MC who isn't as smart as he thinks he is and I guess the author succeeded, because the protagonist ended up being five times as lucky as he is smart, otherwise he wouldn't have made it past day 1. Maybe it gets better, but it lost me at 34%  

  p.s. does anyone know if Mother of Learning is getting reworked? The author said he was aware of the problems of his writing in the early parts of the story and wanted to do something about that, but I don't know if anything came of it yet.
