## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

### Comments:

- u/None:
  ```
  Every human soul is unique, and cannot be replicated, faked, or taken without an agreement where its owner agrees to part with it both in letter and spirit. 

  You are the devil and realize human souls make excellent keys in cryptography, what are the best ways to utilize these keys?

  Inspired by this [SMBC](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/soul-2)
  ```

  - u/MrCogmor:
    ```
    The same ways you would use ordinary secure randomly generated cryptographic keys?

    The comic seems to be suggesting that you use measurements of the soul to generate the numbers for cryptographic keys. Since the soul is unpredictable people can only find the key through brute force.

    &#x200B;

    A [hardware random number generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_random_number_generator) seems like it would give similar cryptographic performance and be easier to use.
