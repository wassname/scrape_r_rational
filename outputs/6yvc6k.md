## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Recently edited and updated some old thoughts on "being naive" and the difference between complex and simple beliefs, interested in feedback on how useful or true people think it is, or whether it's overly obvious or wrong in some way:

    I don't think it's necessary or entirely accurate to reference blockbuster movies as an example of appealing to an uneducated audience. Instead, I think the ones with very simple conflicts are appealing to the same emotions engrained into us by children's stories. Pointing toward children's stories is enough to make your point since their entire purpose is to teach basic moral values to people who lack any ability to understand the context of real world conflicts.

    Other than that, you put forward some ideas that offered insights I hadn't made before and I liked that. However, at the end I didn't get the impression that any conclusion had been reached. It's nice to have knowledge I didn't before, but I'm not sure how I could make use of it. Defining naïveté and exploring it's rhetorical use is interesting, but there didn't seem to be a strategy of how to improve discourse with this information so I don't feel a need to share it.

      Thanks for the feedback!

      >I don't think it's necessary or entirely accurate to reference blockbuster movies as an example of appealing to an uneducated audience. 

      I think it's important to point out that most major media we consume, even as adults, is selling us an overly simplistic narrative (a lot of people for example think that House of Cards is an accurate reflection of what US politics looks like because it's cynical, and it definitely contains a lot of truth to it, but it still simplifies things immensely to create a compelling narrative), so I'm going to try to reinforce and save this point rather than abandon it just yet. Would it help if I clarify that I'm specifically referring to people's ignorance about the issues addressed, and it's not about being "stupid" at all?


      >However, at the end I didn't get the impression that any conclusion had been reached. 

      The conclusion was basically this:

      "Acknowledging complexity would directly challenge our surety in the rightness of our Values, and so we do not confront our naivety in these fields because it is far easier to take an assertive stance that makes sense to our Values than to face the uncertainty of a complex world."

      Do you feel like it needs something that's more explicit? Like "This is what you should do?" There's something in me that resists being so directive, though maybe just a summary of things to be aware of would be good?

    I definitely agree with your viewpoint, and have to add that in a lot of ways, my worldview is what many would consider willfully naive. The fictional character closest to my view would be Papyrus of Undertale.

    But I hold this view because I see cynicism as a sort of race to the bottom. It doesn't help anyone but oneself (in whatever regards it *does*) to look poorly upon people, and quite frequently, *genuine belief* in them can change them. Not always, and I'm not advocating a lack of caution in how or where one shows such empathy, but I find it hard to imagine nearly as many situations where a cynical, pessimistic outlook could make the world a better place so much as their reverse.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      I think that's wishful thinking.

      Ultimately, whether or not you're a cynic shouldn't be about what you wish the world was or what you want the world to become, it should be about having correct information. If the world is made of selfish people, I want to believe the world is made of selfish people, and if the world is made of kind people, I want to believe the world is made of kind people.

      You don't get out of Hell by believing really hard that you're in Heaven, or by accepting really hard that you're in Hell. You get out of Hell by building tools, finding leverage, and maximizing efficiency.
      ```

      - u/Cariyaga:
        ```
        What I want is to have beliefs that will make the world better. To believe the best of people, in my experience, does that far better than the opposite. It's not about 'getting out of Hell,' it's about making Hell a more pleasant place to be. Where 'Hell' in the analogy is the real world, not, you know, actually a place of eternal suffering. :P

  If you haven't read it and are familiar with 40k lore, I recommend [The All Guardsman Party](http://www.theallguardsmenparty.com/index.html). This is a dramatization of a Dark Heresy campaign that the author is playing in, written from an in-universe point of view starting in chapter 2. It's no r/rational fiction, but it's a lot of fun if you like reading this sort of thing.

  What blogs do people on this subreddit read?
  ```

  - u/blazinghand:
    ```
    A selection of blogs I read:

    * **Politics, News, and Economics**
        * [Esquire Politics Blog](http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/) - Charles Pierce's political column is always a fun read for me, though this is more for entertainment than to broaden my horizons.
        * [Lawyers, Guns, & Money](http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/) - Covers American culture, news, and politics, co-written by a half-dozen academics scattered across America and England. More Left than Right.
        * [Ordinary Times](http://ordinary-gentlemen.com/) - Covers American culture, news, and politics, co-written by many bloggers. Generally trends Conservative or Libertarian. Good links collections posted here regularly. 
        * [Marginal Revolution](http://marginalrevolution.com/) - The well-known blog of Cowen and Tabarrok, covering economics, culture, news, and rarely, politics. Premium-tier book recs and links.
        * [Noahpinion](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/) - Economics and politics blog by economist Noah Smith
        * [The Money Illusion](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/) - Economics blog by market monetarist Scott Sumner
    * **Skepticism, Religion, and Rationality**
        * [Kaj Sotala's Blog](https://plus.google.com/+KajSotala) - A blog about technology, culture, rationalism, by Kaj Sotala. Regularly links to interesting content.
        * [On the Margin of Error](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/marginoferr/) - A blog written by an ex-Muslim atheist living in Iran about politics and atheism. 
        * [Mano Singham's Blog](https://freethoughtblogs.com/singham/) - A blog by physics professor and atheist public intellectual Mano Singham. Good discussions of politics and spirituality from a progressive atheistic point of view.
        * [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/) - Psychiatrist Scott Alexander blogs about rationality, culture, and other sundry topics. Probably the best of the rationalism blogs. 

    I also subscribe to a couple magazines and newspapers that give me a regular supply of things to read. The San Jose Mercury News, The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Foreign Policy, The London Review of Books, Car & Driver, and Popular Mechanics regularly give me plenty to read. I bet these offer web-only subscriptions too which is similar to blogs.

    I don't follow blogs, but I do follow some YouTube channels and Podcasts that give me the same fix. The Mixed Six applies intellectualism to pop culture and daily life almost every week and it's hands down my favorite podcast. Vlogbrothers provides something similar, though much less casual in presentation and I don't watch their videos as consistently.

    > how do I get out?

    We can't reply to this in depth unless you mention what the root causes are. I'll go ahead and give my general advice: 

    If it's caused by a temporary situation focus on it being a temporary situation. I've found that I can push myself through quite a lot of garbage as long as I know there's a point where it'll end. Be prepared for delays though.

    If it's a feeling coming from the external world (politics, international events) I highly recommend limiting the time you view or discuss such content.

    If it's from work or interpersonal conflicts I'd try to make it a temporary situation. I.e. move or find a new job.

    I hope it's not related to family.

  I've been painting up some new models for my warhammer 40k army. I'm still trying to decide how the Fire Dragons should look. My army color is blue with silver guns, but Fire Dragons tend to be Red, Yellow, and Gold. Here are a few concepts I painted up that try to mesh those ideas. Which do you think looks best?

      The one on the far right is actually dark blue, with dark blue gun, red helm, gold details. I think the lighting just makes him look darker. All of these models used the same palette of Gold, Blue, Red, and Silver.

  I've gotten really good at dealing with internal sources of anxiety, but I remain terrible at combating external sources and am not sure what I can do about that. I have a social contract with every person I know to be brutally honest about each other's behavior to resolve situations that make it difficult for me function, but when someone refuses to change their behavior after I've explained to them how it hurts my mental state I have no fallback. 

  It's gotten to the point where I'm screaming myself horse at dogs for not listening to me, so I think I need a new tactic. I have plenty of strategies to correct and prevent situations that cause me stress, but have no endurance for situations I cannot control. Cutting myself off from the world and exposing myself to relaxing stimuli is enough to calm me down when I'm having a panic attack, but it's always a temporary solution if the situation persists.

  I thought I could get through life by using my problem solving skills to stop stress from forming in the first place, but I keep running into problems I don't have the power to change and just need to survive. Allowing anxiety to form has never been a concept I've considered before, to the point where I utterly despise stories where characters get continuously screwed over and don't succeed in a timely manner at overcoming the force that's hurting them.

    Stoicism is great to deal with problems you have no control over. Basically it focuses on taking control over your reaction to the things that distress you. In your situation it would help you focus on your reactions instead of the behavior of your friends.

    There's a series of free ebooks, [The Tao of Seneca](https://tim.blog/2017/07/06/tao-of-seneca/) that go in depth about Seneca's views on Stoicism, they're pretty good. There's a great summary about him and his views, that can be a quicker read: [Introduction to Seneca](https://tim.blog/2009/04/24/on-the-shortness-of-life-an-introduction-to-seneca/).

    Meds.

    In my experience, anxiety is much like depression in that you can't just think your way out of it. You aren't anxious because you need to change the way you think, you're anxious because something is going on in your brain to make you that way regardless of logic or reason. Meds can help fix that problem so that you *can* actually think through it.

  So first, a riddle:

  >ketura-Last Monday at 1:50 AM

  >And I've got the whole day off tomorrow, and on top of that my wife is taking my son to go visit grandma

  >so a whole day to code with no interruptions

  >and all this dratted dll shit is finally taken care of

  >so I expect to get at least a *little* done


  Can the viewers at home guess what happened next?

  A. Got a little done on Labor Day

  B. Got a lot done on Labor Day

  C. Got a serious case of the shits on Labor Day and spent two days weeping and staring listlessly at the computer screen

  If you guessed A) or B), no cookie for you!  It just goes to show that I am such an *amateur* pessimist.  I really can’t help but tempt fate.

  Fortunately (as odd a statement this is) the entire week was not Labor Day, so I did get stuff done, just not the huge leap I was aiming for.

  Over the weekend I cleaned house on the code and got it resembling more of a respectable repository than the polished trash heap it was.  This involved extracting all of the compiler-specific code into its own project, which was done at first as a means of tracking down an obscure bug but in retrospect was actually a good move for encapsulation--if, in the far distant future, one wanted to support using different implementations of a C# compiler or even compiling different languages, then having all the relevant code hidden behind an interface is the first step to that.  I don’t think I’ll need that, but it’s nice to have a solid, well-built design nonetheless.

  I managed to standardize the naming schemes, finally cleared up all the warnings that I was shoving under the rug as I developed, and even found the root cause of the obscure bug from earlier (it was causing the entire project to recompile every time I ran it--regardless of whether or not anything changed.  Made debugging a pain in the *ass*).  

  As the cherry on top to this spring cleaning, I also formally adopted a software license.  After mulling over the question for a few days and discussing it with /u/PeridexisErrant, I decided to fling (most of) the received advice to the wind and go with Apache 2.0.  So, all the files are now marked with the appropriate notice, a long-form license is included, and while I was at it I added a readme and some notes for when I next have to wrestle with reorganizing references (this summary downplays it, but it took a *lot* of work to get the stupid library references to play nice with being yanked up and repositioned wherever I felt like).

  ----

  I spent a lot of time grumbling about switching the stats over to use `dynamic` (as suggested by /u/DrunkenQuetzalcoatl last week).  At first I had rejected it out of hand, especially once I had come to the conclusion that using dynamic could result in, say, two units of the same species both having an ATK stat that was different numeric types.  I had all but convinced myself that this would be too unwieldy while serializing (not to mention I was loathe to throw out the work I had made into the current “solution”), but eventually I realized that I could simply use a private `dynamic` value, and re-wire the `Value` field to read (and cast) that field.  

  All the overloaded math operators use the dynamic `RawValue`, while other classes can only access or set the strongly-typed `Value`.  It seems to work pretty flawlessly, actually, and I’m pretty sure that this will be reasonably ironclad once I’ve got the tests and benchmarks rewritten to accommodate the new status quo.  Thanks again for the suggestion, potato.

  ---


  So I guess this week’s TL;DR is “buncha technobabble and very little else”.  I’m still a little salty about losing my Monday; I was ready to knock out the asset serializer, which is the first step to loading/saving unit data.  Guess that’ll be the first thing I tackle this weekend instead.
