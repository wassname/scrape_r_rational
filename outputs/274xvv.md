  Sounds neat - I'm a huge fan of Mr. Weiner (who writes the wonderful [SMBC](http://www.smbc-comics.com/) which you should read if you haven't since it has comics like [this](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3371#comic) and [this](http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2305) which I think would appeal to the people who visit this subreddit - also, if you're going on an archive binge, the red button shows an extra panel).
