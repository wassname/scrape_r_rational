    Really? I was hoping he'd died just to prevent the cliché. I mean, I like Dominic's character, but I like creative plot twists even more.

      There were hints that he'd survive, though. It's not a really unexpected twist.
      I'd even say that, although it had been foreshadowed too, Welexi's 'descent into madness' last chapter felt more surprising.

      At this point, pretty much everything is a cliché, including killing off the protagonist. It hasn't been truly unexpected since Hitchcock's Psycho.
