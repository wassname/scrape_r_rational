  dude i am loving mewtwo's characterization more and more. and victory was straight chilling. thankfully survival's a good boy
  ```

  - u/NestorDempster:
    ```
    Victory had the same goals as Mewtwo, even if an imperfect understanding. Victory was correctable. Survival doesn't/isn't.
    ```

    - u/ALowVerus:
      ```
      Interesting. Victory let himself be destroyed, since his goal was the satisfaction of M2's goals, which would be thwarted by trying to defend himself from M2. Survival was explicitly created with separation from M2's consciousness, and his goal is not to aid M2, but to "Survive". Perhaps he will attempt to take over M2's brain when M2 grows tired of him?
      ```

      - u/None:
        ```
        Do you think he could bruteforce his way through M2's partition?
        ```

        - u/xkcloud:
          ```
          Hopefully, he is way more limited in what he can do than the other tulpas.
          ```

    - u/Croktopus:
      ```
      oo fuck thats some good foreshadowing then too. especially since he showed that survival has the potential to influence mewtwo's body

      though i hope they keep their buddy buddy relationship...but like, yeah right
      ```

- u/WankSocrates:
  ```
  I love everything about this. Mewtwo's characterisation is superb, and I've always been a fan of how you write Giovanni.

  As to the horror behind the veil - guessing Giratina? But in any case awesome (and thoroughly chilling) take on Unown.
  ```

  - u/Electric999999:
    ```
    Might be the weird hive mind crystal thing from one of the movies instead, Giratina isn't associated with unown and I feel like Mewtwo would have noticed if it was a ghost since they do weird stuff to psychics.  

    Still if this is Giratina I wonder what Palkia and Dialga will do, since they canonically have the power to literally destroy and remake the universe and legendaries seem to be getting power boosts in this story.
    ```

    - u/interested_commenter:
      ```
      The Legendaries in this story aren't really any stronger than they are said to be in cannon (except maybe for Pressure), its just that their power is actually expressed in a realistic way instead of in-game mechanics. You can't beat one with a Rattata just because you overleveled it. The Stormbringers are supposed to be able to summon huge storms, the Weather trio is supposed to be able to alter the planet's climate, and here we see them doing so. Dialga and Palkia shouldn't behave any differently than they do in the games; they will have absurd power but won't want to actually use it unless a human messes with them. The Spear Pillar stuff will likely be handled human vs human
      ```

- u/xkcloud:
  ```
  I love this chapter. I was kinda glad when Victory was destroyed, although it bit him back later, quite literally. Man, I felt so bad for Mazda when his tail was bit off just like that. I couldn't have imagined the great Mewtwo being an amputee. I just wish so much for him to see the good in humanity.
  ```

  - u/Slinkinator:
    ```
    Is Mazda a typo or a fan name for mewtwo?
    ```

    - u/DaystarEld:
      ```
      In this story it's what Sabrina calls him, in the privacy of their telepathic conversations :)
      ```

    - u/mbzrl:
      ```
      It's the name Sabrina gave to and uses for Mewtwo. From chapter 40
      ```

  - u/GreenSatyr:
    ```
    Think of the fan art though. Badass mewtwo with ragged tail stump.
    ```

    - u/Slinkinator:
      ```
      Oh, frieza
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        Huh, I didn't even consider that similarity. I guess the tail just feels like the most "expendable" appendage in bipeds that have it so it makes sense to lose it if something is going to be maimed while expecting to still fight.
        ```

        - u/GreenSatyr:
          ```
          Well, in the far future when english teachers everywhere teach this text, they're going to say that the loss of the tail makes Mewtwo seem more human, and symbolizes its failure to attend to survival the way a proper wild animal should. Perhaps the metaphor will be tied into what mewtwo learns in conjunction with the regrowth of the tail, if it regrows.
          ```

          - u/DaystarEld:
            ```
            Ha, I like it. Good example of why I hated English teachers without them necessarily being wrong in their method/philosophy of looking deeper into a text :)

    Could be that M2 is able to find healing at a Pokemon Center, perhaps they have regenerative methods beyond throwing potion at it until it gets better?

    - u/Roneitis:
      ```
      I think we've seen permanently disabled pokemon elsewhere? I can't remember any specific examples, but if so, it would seem unlikely that the tail could be healed

  - u/None:
    ```
    I think he's already not wholesome - before the incident with the shark pokemon, he seems calculating/analytical in his ability to survive/consider other pokemon's actions. After that, he appears to have some sort of a psychological trigger:

    > ... I can barely focus my senses on any surrounding minds.

    > ... The loneliness overwhelms me, and before I can make any conscious decision I find that I am already shaping a new tulpa.

    > ... The thought of relearning how to walk is not in itself daunting, but what weighs on my thoughts instead is the feeling of failure.

    > ... As I foraged, every unexpected noise made me jump, every shifting shadow sped my pulse. Once a flock of murkrow flew overhead, causing me to instinctively send a wave of force up at them… which, of course, did nothing.

    > The thought that Giovanni may have been right to keep me confined and safe in the lab is humiliating, but impossible to entirely dismiss.

    Even though it could also partially be because Victory is gone.
    ```

- u/Galap:
  ```
  Interesting irony here that Mewtwo is kind of doing to his new created selves the same thing that Giovanni did to him-- creating them and limiting their freedom to act, and being ready to pull the plug on them if they head in a direction that he doesn't like.
  ```

  - u/360Saturn:
    ```
    hmmm great catch!
    ```

  - u/thrawnca:
    ```
    I see two main differences, both related to the fact that tulpas are merely subdivisions of Mewtwo's own mind:

    \- The tulpas don't really have independent existence and rights, even if they can have semi-independent thought, since they're just part of the whole.

    \- They're aren't really killed, merely reintegrated, their memories and processing capacity becoming part of the one thought process.
    ```

    - u/shankarsivarajan:

      >don't really have independent existence and rights … since they're just part of the whole.

      Do you hear yourself?

        Yes, but perhaps you're reading something in my words that I haven't?

- u/ManyCookies:
  ```
  > and Trust was unwilling to cede control, only to be integrated against its will

  UHHHHH

  This might just be narrative pattern matching, but Victory gave up suspiciously easily there. \<I wonder if Victory figured out how to make *hidden* sub-tulpas, amnesia'd this fact (and possibly some details of those "willing" conversions) and stored a dormant backup.\>
  ```

  - u/hankyusa:
    ```
    It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you.
    ```

  - u/BenceJoful:
    ```
    I was thinking a similar thing, especially as Victory 

    >considered how it might shape *my* thoughts and feelings, strip away those things that might get in the way of achieving my goals.

    Who's to say Victory didn't actually do that shaping before the escape, then amnesia doing so?
    ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Wouldn't hidden tulpas be as vulnerable to M2 reassimilating them as Victory was?

    Edit: Oh, you mean them influencing M2 without his knowledge? That's disturbing, yes.

    Edit2: Or do you mean that Victory just pretended to be vulnerable. I get it now.
    ```

  - u/ThePrinceofMagnets:
    ```
    I think it's more likely that Survive will betray Mazda because its goals aren't essentially aligned with Mazda's the way Victory's goals were.
    ```

- u/Flavius_Belisarius_:
  ```
  Well, fuck. How long do we have, lore wise, until the events of Sinnoh? Official sources place them 3 years after the Hoenn and Kanto games, so the clock is ticking. Cyrus trying to rewrite the universe seems like exactly the tear needed to speed up this “mad god”’s bridge to reality. Which would line up, assuming that was Giratina Mewtwo witnessed, a being which lore wise breaks into reality at the climax of Platinum version. Sinnoh seems out of scope, but I wonder if Turnback cave is the focal point of the unknown activities. It’s not terribly separated from the solaceon ruins either.

  On an unrelated note, I wonder if Mewtwo‘s human parent is related to Red. Probably not his parents, I can’t see a connection to Giovanni there, but maybe extended family? It’s probably silly, but their reliance on multiple aspects of themselves seems intentionally similar.
  ```

  - u/hbthebattle:
    ```
    I think there’s a pretty high chance Mewtwo human genetic donor was Red’s dad.
    ```

    - u/ThePrinceofMagnets:
      ```
      Why is that? I was thinking it would be Dr. Fuji
      ```

      - u/hbthebattle:
        ```
        There's a lot of parallels between Red's and Mewtwo's powers- they way they both make and switch between multiple personalities separated by partitions. Mewtwo is also specifically the same age as Red/Blue/Leaf, and Red's dad probably fits the compassionate requirements considering his line of work and how he died. It just makes a lot of sense that the parallels between Red and Mewtwo have a deeper meaning.
        ```

      - u/GreenCloakGuy:
        ```
        Why Dr. Fuji? Given >!the lab is in Cinnabar, and the Pokemon Special manga having Blaine be the donor in question!<, I think >!Blaine!< is a distinct possibility.
        ```

    - u/shankarsivarajan:
      ```
      Since you mention it, do we know how he died?
      ```

      - u/Low_Hour:
        ```
        Was killed by a Scyther in a farm on a mission iirc
        ```

        - u/shankarsivarajan:
          ```
          Ok, thanks. So unlikely to be orchestrated by Giovanni?
          ```

          - u/Low_Hour:
            ```
            I mean, it's possible he had a Renegade use their Scyther to kill him, but I can't think of any reason why he would.
            ```

            - u/shankarsivarajan:
              ```
              Neither can I, but it's the kind of cartoonishly evil thing he would do, though for smart, non-cartoonish reasons.

              Edit: Never mind. I looked up the relevant section (Chapter 2), and it specifies "wild scyther."
              ```

              - u/Low_Hour:
                ```
                So, I don't actually think Giovanni did it, but just because Red *thinks* it was a wild Scyther doesn't mean it's true.
                ```

- u/CarVac:
  ```
  Interesting… a new and greater threat, unown to humans…
  ```

- u/sibswagl:
  ```
  Well, my immediate thought is Ultra Beasts, but I don't think Ultra Beasts want to consume reality. Though I never played SM, so IDK.

  Secondary option is one of the Sinnoh legendaries, but same problem. Giratina, *maybe* depending on how you interpret his history (supposedly banished from our reality).
  ```

  - u/WankSocrates:
    ```
    Giratina was my first thought. "A distorted world" - that phrasing seems very unlikely to be accidental.
    ```

  - u/Radix2309:
    ```
    He mentioned going to the northern island, which would be Hokkaido in our world. In-universe the equivalent would be Sinnoh.  

    Sinnoh has Giratina of course. The creation trio is almost certainly a level above the weather trio. Giratina is in another dimension and is an equivelent to Satan in their mythology. I believe pokedex entries from the games even mention it's desire to consume our reality.

    But biggest clue is the Unown. Sinnoh has the Solaceon ruins.
    ```

    - u/GreenCloakGuy:
      ```
      I took it to mean the Sinjoh Ruins (from HGSS), which are stated to be somewhat north of Kanto/Jhoto but still south of Sinnoh, and pretty far away from any other civilization. Being in 'the wilderness north of Kanto' would make sense - and it's a focal point for unown and Arceus in general (along with the creation trio).
      ```

      - u/Flavius_Belisarius_:
        ```
        Solaceon is close to turnback cave too though, which is where a permanent hole to the distortion world eventually opens in DPPt.
        ```

      - u/TheTrickFantasic:
        ```
        At first, this was my thought too.  But upon a reread, I properly noticed this line:
        >By the end of the week we are far from Kanto and deep into the wilds of the northern island.

        That seems to confirm that Mewtwo is in Sinnoh by this point.
        An indeterminate amount of weeks later, Mewtwo follows the Unown from a curious patch of grass through a forest, which may or may not correspond to the Spring Path.
        ```

  - u/hbthebattle:
    ```
    The only Pokémon I see capable of commanding the unown in such a manner is Arceus itself...
    ```

    - u/sibswagl:
      ```
      Something could be high-jacking them. You’d think if it was Arceus, he’d just open the portal himself.
      ```

      - u/Flavius_Belisarius_:
        ```
        Besides, Arceus doesn’t really live in a different reality like some other legendaries. Just a magic staircase thing above Spear Pillar.
        ```

  - u/Flavius_Belisarius_:
    ```
    The birds and some other legendaries are so different in this story that I could see an argument for either Giratina or Necrozma. Though given the capabilities of Dialga and Palkia, Giratina seems more capable of pulling off what Mewtwo fears.
    ```

- u/sharikak54:
  ```
  I loved the explanation of how Mewtwo learned Mist, and the foreshadowing of being able to learn all those fire and ice TM moves!  

  Though, if Mewtwo is level 64 already, shouldn’t it have already learned Aura Sphere to defend itself from Dark types? ;)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    The level he learns Mist actually jumps around wildly from one gen to the next, I think the earliest is in the 30s or something :) Seemed reasonable that he'd figure this out on his own before something like Aura Sphere.
    ```

    - u/TheTrickFantasic:
      ```
      The earliest is in fact level 22 in FireRed & LeafGreen, followed by level 36 in Gen V.
      ```

    - u/sharikak54:
      ```
      Haha, I couldn’t remember so I looked up the levels on Bulbapedia!  I guess gen 8 moveset wasn’t exactly ideal...
      ```

  - u/TheTrickFantasic:
    ```
    So... I just wanna point this out:

    * In the English localization, the technique is called Mist.
    * In the original Japanese, the technique is called White Mist.
    * But in meteorology... condensed water vapour at ground level is called "fog" when visibility is reduced to <1 km, and "mist" when visibility is between 1 and 10 km.

    Meteorology is cool, guys!
    ```

- u/Sailor_Vulcan:
  ```
  Since mewtwo is made of biological rather than mechanical material, is it even possible for him to increase his own intelligence? Would his vast psychic powers let him steal control of the unown and start assimilating their power into his own?
  ```

  - u/Chosen_Pun:
    ```
    I imagine he *could* outsource processing to an unown swarm, but there's a decent chance he considers becoming dependent on them a non-starter. Maybe he can develop the ability to consciously direct Recover to mess with his brain chemistry?
    ```

- u/BavarianBarbarian_:
  ```
  >Another pause. My eyes close as I listen, and though it makes no difference in such absolute darkness, it becomes easy to picture Giovanni beside me. Seated across a game board, perhaps, gaze down as he considers his next moves.

  Getting heavy Sylvester vibes off of Mewto this chapter...
  ```

- u/ArcFurnace:
  ```
  I would just like to say that I'm still mad that Unown never did anything cool in the games when you collected all of them, so having them turn up doing something cool *twice* so far has been very satisfying.

  Although this second incident is rather more of an issue than the first ...
  ```

- u/AKAAkira:
  ```
  Yeah as soon as I read of Mewtwo relaxing in the ocean without particular mention of avoiding Dark pokemon I thought, "Sharpedo." Even then, I gave it a fifty-fifty chance on whether he'd be able to leave before getting attacked, but then uh...Sharpedo. Probably. Carvanha would be extra humiliating. (And he really should have known better too, didn't his pursuers have Dark pokemon that were chasing him underwater?)

  Bye-bye Victory, you will...only be missed when practically speaking. And hopefully won't be coming back. Survive's shaped up to be a much better pal.

  I'm curious about Mewtwo's aversion of capturing others in Pokeballs. He's portrayed to be somewhat parallel to Red (e.g. development of tulpas), but on this case, in contrast, Red is actually rather enthusiastic in entering a Pokeball himself if the brain-death aspect of it can be engineered away, for its potential benefits (training programs, prolonging life). I wonder what could be the cause of the aversion in Mewtwo.

  ...A thought occurs. Could one of Mewtwo's human genetic parents have been *N*? Because he's the one person I just thought of who would feel so strongly against enslaving pokemon...although this might be a bit of a stretch. It's not like personality traits can reliably pass from parent to child.

  Finally, my favourite part...the unown's secret. Whoo boy. I actually didn't expect this story to jump in scale so high, not too long ago - in an earlier chapter Aiko and Leaf were even discussing the "realistic" power levels of mythical pokemon ("Celebi probably can't *actually* travel back in time, Jirachi probably can't *actually* grant wishes"...) - but escalating events to world-level repercussions (competently) is pretty much my favourite thing in stories, so here I am, grinning like an idiot in gleeful anticipation. So while this probably isn't a thread that's going to be picked up anytime soon (Mewtwo only encountered the unown some weeks after Groudon/Kyogre, Red/Blue/Leaf's timeline as of last chapter was only two days after the event), I'll be eagerly waiting for it in future updates. With best wishes to the protagonists, assuming they're gonna have to be involved with it eventually.

  Back to the point though - at first I thought the "mad god" was a reinterpreted Arceus - that was my assumption as well for the god that Wally influenced through his unown - but the discussion on this page convinced me Giratina fits much better. Still, if it was Giratina both times, that brings up an entirely new concern of Giratina's influence on Rayquaza that I wouldn't have if it was Arceus. Arceus is pretty much God, so I could accept his influence on Rayquaza to be a simple, and literal, divine intervention - but Giratina, "ruler of anti-matter" Giratina, I would question on both the "how" and "why".

  I'm thinking one answer that satisfies both is that in this verse, Giratina already controls some of the legendaries (the how) and sending them around to actively hamper humanity is, in some way, letting it progress towards its goal of consuming that reality (the why). This *seems* like a leap in logic, but somehow doesn't feel that way to me. I already wondered before if there was something actually intelligent in the way that the Storm Gods consistently harass the Kanto region, for one. And when I think about how, in the original games, Mewtwo's main Ability is Pressure, which in this fic he doesn't have yet...suddenly I see a connection between the way Mewtwo's mind was scrambled just by glimpsing the mad god, and the way Pressure, well, pressures all minds in its area of effect, and from there it's only a short jump to assuming how Pressure actually works: some kind of connection that exposes the minds around the legendary to the influence/presence of some eldritch god.

  Well, in the end I can only call this a wild guess. I can already see a counter-argument starting with how some of the legendaries that I'm implying are under the influence of Giratina (the regis and Rayquaza) don't actually have Pressure, for one. Future chapters may prove me wrong entirely.

  I don't know if Mewtwo would go straight back to Giovanni for help, or to some other humans - Giovanni definitely has the resources, but trust might be a bit harder to maintain. Either way, here's hoping Mewtwo's next encounter with humans go better.
  ```

  - u/ArcFurnace:
    ```
    Technically we saw Mewtwo demonstrate Pressure (or an equivalent functionality) in this chapter, when he drove the local ocean Pokemon into a frenzy so they would attack and delay his captors. It's just not active continuously the way it is for others with that ability, although it probably could be if he chose to do so.
    ```

    - u/AKAAkira:
      ```
      It's also not effective on Dark pokemon the way actual Pressure would be. But yeah, other than that, I guess that's true in one sense.
      ```

- u/SecretCrisis:
  ```
  Really cool to get a Mewtwo interlude! We're finally in the middle stage of the story, and our main man (Pokeman?) is free!

  I was honestly relieved when he took Victory down. There was always that sort of doubt that Victory would absorb the other tulpas, and I'm glad it was stopped quickly after. Survive seems interesting, since it's basically a fusion of the others. Also, now both Mewtwo and Red have one other *personality* with them. Wonder how that will play out.

  Mewtwo's human parent seems like a very interesting topic. The description might fit anyone really, but I was thinking someone like Professor Oak. I know it won't be the case here, but something like how Superboy has 2 parents in Superman and Lex Luthor would have been a cool idea to run with here. In that case, Giovanni and Oak.

- u/DavidGretzschel:
  ```
  Interesting, the new legendary threat is to the Hoenn Legendaries as they are to the Kanto Stormbringers.

  So a legendary Pokémon's destructiveness are proportional to how easy it is to kill them.  
  Noone can touch the Stormbringers, but the far more dangerous Kyogre and Groudon were killed in a couple hours after making an appearance.

  And now this new threat apparently wants to eat reality wholesale, but you probably just have to exterminate the Unown species to get rid off it.

  Btw, I don't quite get why chapter 84 was entirely sombre in tone. Nobody was dancing on the street that humanity finally killed some legendaries (admittedly with the help of some other legendaries, but still).

    Exterminating the Unown species could be tricky, seeing as they emerge spontaneously from thin air (and sometimes writing on a wall).  Sounds like someone needs to research *the origin of species* and figure out where they all come from!

    The fact that the titans awaking in Hoenn meant it would never be peaceful again, plus other regions now had to worry about similar circumstances (namely, Unova has its own set of dormant titans, Kalos could have some stormbringers, and Johto may even have more hoenn legendaries depending on how the embedded tower works) would put quite the damper on things. Plus, it took other, equal or stronger legendaries to beat Kyogre and Groudon. Giratina should have other methods of getting in, it didn't use the unknown in the games (though it wasn't malicious there)
    ```

      ```
      Still, the fact that there was no celebration at all was odd to me. Like they're not exactly sure, if Kyogre and Groudon are actually dead.

      The way it was written, that wasn't entirely clear, but I wish we'd have some confirmation of what people believe.
      ```

      - u/DaystarEld:
        ```
        The way I see it, if the legendaries in question had been ones people already were regularly harassed by, people would have been celebrating. But what ended up happening is that entirely new massive threats appeared, killed lots of people, caused unprecedented destruction, and then were barely held off while other legendaries killed them.

        AND unleashed new permanent legendaries.

        AND made people aware that further ancient threats might be lurking.

        So yeah... not exactly something I imagine most people would be celebrating.

    Kyogre and Groudon aren't easier to kill, at least outside of the lack of pressure.   

    Kyogre only went down because Groudon is its equal and Groudon had help, then Groudon was beaten only because Rayquaza came and crushed him.  

    I imagine Rayquaza could take any of the stormbringers and making one stormbringers fight another would probably work fairly well too (especially as they're probably not quite so evenly matched), but neither of those two things are really doable, Rayquaza doesn't care about stormbringers and they appear at different times of year so getting two to fight is unlikely.

      Yeah, so far no Legendary has been killed without the help of another Legendary. Which rather validates Giovanni's plan with Mewtwo. 

      I'm also curious as to what will happen with Latios and Latias. So far they're the only natural, nonhostile Legendaries we've seen. In theory Rayquaza might also be nonhostile, but we don't really have a good impression of its behavior (seems like it fucked off after killing Groudon?), while the Lati twins were actively cooperating with May and Brendan.
      ```

    - u/DavidGretzschel:
      ```
      We don't know whether Groudon was necessary to kill Kyogre, at all.  
      Its fate could very well have been sealed, as soon as it swallowed Surge's Magneton.  
      No good reason to assume that the aquarium fish would have stomach acids strong enough to dissolve metal.

      What could it have possibly done against a Magneton inside its stomach constantly shocking it?

    They're very handy for an author trying to write the POV of someone who spends extended amounts of time isolated and/or stuck in their own head.

    I mean, the closest example I can think of is people with Dissociative Personality Disorder. Generally I get the impression that it's not super explicitly a good/bad thing, and you can still live a relatively normal life. But I don't really know much about it.

  - u/D0TheMath:
    ```
    I believe the "internal family system" thing is a recognized psychological tool. I often use something similar when deciding on what I want to do in any given moment. It's more helpful for aligning my actions with my priorities, rather than producing novel solutions to problems or multitasking (and when I say more helpful, I mean I've never gotten better problem solving abilities or abilities to multitask from it, and only use it for action prioritization). I've also found it helpful for increasing focus, thinking "ok, for this hour I will spend my time furthering goal X, so X-focused D0TheMath is in control right now". Overall, I'd say experiment with it for a few days, as with any new cognitive tool, to see if it produces good results for you.

    There is in fact an /r/tulpas . Make of that what you will.

    Edit: Ooh this is interesting. [Do You Regret Creating Your Tulpa](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/io6vn0/do_you_regret_creating_your_tulpa)

    Common thread seems to be that many of the people there self report creating them to cope with loneliness/anxiety/depression, and self report it as a net positive / are happy with the decision.

  - u/AKAAkira:

    They do have subs dedicated to it on Reddit - r/tulpas seems to be the main one, and r/tulpa the alt. There's also a Wikipedia page, though it doesn't feature any comment from psychologists, which is what I'd be most interested in.

    My impression of them after not-that-deep scrutiny as an outsider is that tulpas seem useful enough as an attempt for companionship. (Maybe overly so. Try sorting r/tulpas by top of past week.) I don't think I've seen anyone on those subs who created tulpas for strictly constructive purposes, but I don't see how it's impossible to do so, if the tulpa is created with discipline. That said, it's not like there's much scientific research on it (that I saw), so it may be the case that it's not possible for some people to actually form tulpas without a mind that needs companionship (and thus is willing to force the brain into creating a companion), or is hyperactive (and thus has the brain processing to spare), or possess some fictional mind superpower. And then there's the possibility of something like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/j2wv5z/is_it_possible_to_bring_back_an_old_tulpa_that_i/g796uyy/), where even if you succeed in forming a tulpa you're just that unlucky person whose tulpas don't actually stick around 24/7.

  Oh wow. 

  Considering Survive weakened the partition, took partial control of the body, and is shown to have terrifying potential, all while lacking Victory’s complacency, I am once again filled with dread.
  And all that aside from the swarm of poke-nanorobots taking over the world!

  Thank you for this bombshell of a chapter. This was ...eventful!

  Given everything else that's happened recently, I can see the revelation of this eldritch thing making a lot of people just give up and take it's side. Hopefully Mewtwo is going to find Dr. Fuji and not just sit on a bus and yell at people.
