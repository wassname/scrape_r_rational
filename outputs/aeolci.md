[The Asteroid Strike: Unconceivable Threats in Waves Arisen and HPMOR](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9esous/the_asteroid_strike_unconceivable_threats_in/) by /u/timecubefanfiction, a long and thoughtful essay on threats and narrative.

#### Best Comment
> Similar to a comment in the thread you linked, it seems like you could kill the entire r/rational community by putting a slow acting contact poison on a book labelled "Descriptions of infohazards", and then wait a week for it to be shared to and by everyone.

Thanks to everyone who participated in nominations, and of course, thanks to everyone who participated in the community in the past year. We'll almost certainly be doing this again next year, so make notes about what you find most worthwhile.

### Comments:

- u/CCC_037:
  ```
  [](/ajblush) I'm... surprised and gratified.

  Is this where one is traditionally supposed to thank an implausibly long list of people and animals, seventeen percent of them being invented out of whole cloth?

- u/Makin-:
  ```
  I hope next year there's more people nominating stuff. Be sure to use your "save" options whenever you see a cool post on /r/rational! I know I had trouble remembering cool stuff, but I still managed to win [some](https://i.imgur.com/nHinCPf.png) platinum.
  ```

- u/JohnKeel:
  ```
  If you include ?context=10 at the end of a comment URL you get the preceding 10 posts (or other number) in the chain. It helps a lot with readability.
  ```
