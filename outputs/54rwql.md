    Yeah, it's described as an experiment in constrained writing. The same author also wrote a fantasy story told through Yelp user reviews, and other such stuff.

    I thought the big reveal (page 7 and onward) was amazing, haven't read anything like it before. Sadly, I failed to figure it out before the characters did, but now I think it was possible. The biggest hint is that time travel or communication doesn't work in the story. Ingalls (the only scientist in the group) keeps saying that, and she's right.

  I really enjoyed it. Its funny how I like 'horror' while seriously disliking actually being scared.
