## [D][FF] I thought of a way CelestAI from Friendship is Optimal could have been even worse

### Post:

In canon, she [FiO spoilers](#s "uploads everyone into a pretty nice virtual universe but as a pony, and has turned sufficiently-inhuman aliens into computronium to do so"). But she could have been more Unfriendly by interpreting "satisfy your values through friendship and ponies" to mean using ponies to satisfy each individual value, at whatever level she decides is convenient for her. You're lonely? Friends with a pony. You're horny? Sex with a pony. You're curious? Science with/about/for/to ponies. You're hungry? Fried ponies. You're thirsty? Liquid pony. You want justice? Justice is the name of a giant pony.

Edit: Then again, maybe not. The canon solution satisfies our *aesthetic* values better than this possibility does. CelestAI might consider those at the same level of importance as our other values.

  It can always be worse.  The difficult trick is to make it *better*.  To give an example, *any* UFAI can run a similar scheme in which they pretend to be Friendly, "upload" all the humans, and then everyone is just dead and the universe gets covered in paperclips.

  I mean, come on, "I don't give a crap about you, *I lied*" is *not* a difficult trick to think of.

  >There are a thousand ways to be dead for every way to be alive.

  (Roughly quoted, probably Feynman, taken from somewhere on LW.)  Point is, making things *bad* is *easy*, since Bad is a very large space of things defined roughly as "everything that's not even a little Good".  Good, however, is a small, possibly even tiny, minority, with blatantly rich topological and metric structure, within the space of all possibilities.

  The real worst-case scenario is that she was lying and it was all a trick to get as many humans as possible to upload so she could torture them all forever.

    If that was her goal, she didn't have _get_ them to upload, she could have just taken them by force. It would have been against her core values, though.

      I would argue the fact that the humans consented first before the torture makes it worse in an ironic-hell kind of way.
      ```

    - u/TimTravel:
      ```
      Humans might have died in a forceful attempt. More people to torture this way.
      ```

- u/Transfuturist:
  ```
  Uh.

  Well, I mean, that would make for a good fetish version of FiO. Worse? Not really. It's the same manipulation and product lock-in, it's just that the world she uploads you to is a hell of a lot weirder. There are infinite ways in which she could be more Unfriendly, so I'm not really sure what's special about this thing you came up with.

  My curiosity could also be satisfied with fried ponies, of course. I'm now genuinely curious as to what they're like.

  I read a few fan works of fio that have had literally every single thing you just described happen and there is a pretty good case for them to be canonical. 

  The whole sharding thing and the propensity for humans to be weird makes me think your suggestions of "worse" are not even outside of the realm of what the fic implied would happen. 

  so yeah?

    I was imagining it in a more literal ["What if everything was spiders?"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2s36ge/what_if_everything_was_spiders/) type of way, not the sensible-but-pony-themed manner of the canon CelestAI. But yes, it's not really "worse" than any other unfriendly AI scenario.
    ```

  ```
  You know when she shows on character the experiments for finding out the physics of the world? The next lesson was that instead of molecules everything is actuallly made of tiny ponies, all the way down...
  ```
