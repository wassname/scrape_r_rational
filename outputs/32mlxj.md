  There's a second story by Sam as well: [Introductory Antimemetics](http://www.scp-wiki.net/introductory-antimemetics)
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    Now this â€“ *this* is some rational horror.
    ```

  - u/MadScientist14159:
    ```
    [spoiler](#s "Until Kim claimed to be an orphan I was pretty sure that Grey wasn't an antimeme at all, but some kind of physics warper employed by the foundation to train/test potential antimemetics division recruits by fucking with their heads.")
    ```

    - u/Chronophilia:
      ```
      No, but that would also make a good story.
      ```

      - u/MadScientist14159:
        ```
        I love your flair.
        ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    I figured out the twist about five seconds before Kim, and felt quite proud of myself.

    Also, reading a story where half the climax is precisely the same as reading it is great.
    ```

    - u/Transfuturist:
      ```
      So fucking twisty. <3
      ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Not as good as the main link, but still fun.
    ```

  - u/TastyBrainMeats:
    ```
    That was something special.
    ```

- u/alexanderwales:
  ```
  This is my favorite SCP story. Probably my favorite SCP related thing in general.
  ```

  - u/khafra:
    ```
    Probably the favorite SCP of Imp, from Worm, as well.
    ```

    - u/MadScientist14159:
      ```
      > Imp

      Who?
      ```

      - u/khafra:
        ```
        > Who?

        Imp, turn it off!
        ```

- u/chaosmosis:
  ```
  What's up with Marion in the beginning? Why was she forgetting about the cigarettes?

  I was hoping for something super subtle to be in this story, like Marion was actually a skip meme the entire time.
  ```

  - u/VorpalAuroch:
    ```
    My theory: the thing that follows her around ate the memory of asking
    ```

    - u/xamueljones:
      ```
      Put a spoiler tag on that.
      ```

      - u/Transfuturist:
        ```
        Put a spoiler tag on what now?
        ```

        - u/xamueljones:
          ```
          The fact that something is eating her memory is a spoiler in the beginning when we don't know what is causing her 'forgetfulness'.
          ```

          - u/Transfuturist:
            ```
            What's eating whose memory? Spoiler for what?
            ```

            - u/xamueljones:
              ```
              I'm sorry, but I forgot what you're talking about. I don't even recognize this site. I guess I'll just deactivate my account and read only to myself this fascinating essay about time travel I seem to mysteriously have on my computer.
              ```

      - u/alexanderwales:
        ```
        I think comments for a submission are implicitly spoiler-scoped for that submission.
        ```

      - u/VorpalAuroch:
        ```
        I don't think that's warranted.
        ```

  - u/Transfuturist:
    ```
    Well, she has a pet skip meme, if the term means what I think it means.
    ```

- u/noggin-scratcher:
  ```
  After reading the link I came and read the comments, and then returned to the top of the page and went "Ooh, a link, I wonder what this is" and opened it again.

  So yeah, I'm concerned I may have an antimeme stalking me. It would explain a lot of lost memories.

    Fishmonger episode?

        ```
        Huh. Is that true? I heard about it, but it was a few months before I discovered the wiki, so I only have people's opinions about what the meat of the issue was.

            Unfortunately it happens a lot. 

            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Ownership_of_content applies to so many things in real life it's ridiculous. Admittedly this is slightly different because each individual entry isn't collaborative, but the site as a whole is. Er... necropost, I know. Going through top /r/rational posts >.>

    ```
    No. No explanation in the comments. And then they have to get the mods to delete the old posts.

    <.< I may be very slightly evil...
    ```

- u/protagnostic:
  ```
  Well, that was terrifying.

  Something about this particular SCP entry calls to mind the Laundry Files.
