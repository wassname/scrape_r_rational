## [WIP][RST][Q][HSF][EDU] A little help communicating some ideas?

### Post:

Anyone up for beta reading a 2,000 word section of S.I.?

I've just finished putting together an initial draft of Bunny pontificating about the ideas discussed in https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2g09xh/bstqrsthsf_factchecking_some_quantum_math/ . I could really use some feedback to make sure I'm having her explain them in a way that's actually comprehensible to the reader. Anyone who'd like to help me with this, I've pasted the initial draft to a GoogleDoc at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lOQAAM3fdnF2ew7CgBQqSLtk21_4Foa8n7IB3Ay0ze8/edit?usp=sharing , which is set to allow comments.
