## [RT][HF] Rokka no Yuusha

### Post:

Just wanted to recommend an anime/light novel series I've been enjoying considerably. 

Rokka no Yuusha starts out with a fairly traditional fantasy premise - every (x) years, the Vile God awakens and six heroes are chosen to defeat him. The heroes are marked with the sigil of a flower. There are always six.

Seven marked people show up near the rendezvous point. 

The portions of the series that I've read and watched so far are a fair play mystery. The characters are, in my opinion, also at least Level 1 intelligent characters - there's a lot of very deliberate problem solving that people would actually go through in that kind of situation. Some characters are more rational than others, but it's very believable, imo.

There's also a strong, internally consistent magic system (which I particularly enjoy because it's very similar to the one I use in my own books). 

I haven't read all the books yet, but I'm hoping the series stays this consistently rational throughout. 

The anime is available on [Crunchyroll](http://www.crunchyroll.com/rokka-braves-of-the-six-flowers-).

  Your own books? Er, I mean...

  I mean of course I knew that you are author Andrew Rowe, author of Forging Divinity. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/30tre4/rfantasy_writer_of_the_day_andrew_rowe/)

    Oh, the perils of using the internet as an ancillary lobe.

    Your google-fu is strong. =D

      My process was:

      1) Deduce that you've probably used Reddit to share or promote your book.

      2) Click your username

      3) See a post in /r/Fantasy

      4) Assume like most authors you would have your book or name in your flair.

      5) Click context on a /r/Fantasy post

      6) See that I was right about 4

      At this point I wanted to know the book so:

      7) Google 'Andrew Rowe'

      8) Assume you don't play professional hockey

      9) Google 'Andrew Rowe writer'

      10) Find reddit post about book from author Andrew Rowe

      11) double check usernames to verify

        Good process. 8) is especially important. =D

        I feel like there should probably be a "Profit" step.

        As such, since you've done such good detective work, PM me if you want a Kindle code for my book.

          Would you provide an .epub for people who bought your book on kindle? I HATE reading on the kindle app on Android, while Moon Reader Pro is by far the most comfortable reading tool I've ever used.

  What are the villains like? The vile god and such. Do they have a believable motivation?

    Hard to say thus far. We haven't seen anything from their perspective at the point in the series I'm up to. That said, we do see some snippets about the culture of the demons, and they're not unambiguously evil. They also adapt to human culture and tactics.

  Seems fun. I think the mystery can be solved by episode 6.
