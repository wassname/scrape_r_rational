Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

  **Mistborn Munchkinry Miniseries Part 5: Brass**

  Ok, week five of the mistborn munchkinry miniseries. For general overview of the magic system, see [part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/9zz4sa/d_saturday_munchkinry_thread/ead595h/). I strongly recommend reading the first part of that comment if you weren't here for the past weeks and aren't familiar with the mistborn setting.

  *Spoiler note*: I will avoid things that I consider excessive spoilers, but the exact workings of the magic system are moderate spoilers themselves, so if you intend to read the books and are sensitive to spoilers you should probably skip this one.

  This weeks metal is brass, the first of the mental metals. As always I'm interested in what a brass twinborn compounder can do, both here on earth (where they are the only one with this powerset) and in Era 2 Scadrial.

  **Allomancy**

  Brass allomancers are known as soothers. An allomancer burning brass can focus on a person or a group of people to reduce the intensity of (soothe) the emotions those people are feeling. Soothers can soothe away all emotions (in which case the target feels nothing but an oppressive numbness clouding their mind) or pick one or more individual emotions to soothe away.

  What counts as an emotion for Allomancy is fairly broad, it includes things like fear, anger and happiness, but also hunger, pride, feelings of loyalty and even someone's sense of fatigue. Note that soothing the sensation of hunger or fatigue is purely a mental effect, it doesn't make the physical effects of exhaustion/starvation go away, it just makes it easier for the target to ignore those effects for a while.

  This ability is not mind control, brass allomancers have to be subtle if they want to use their abilities to influence unwilling targets. Emotions can be dampened, but not fully taken away and once someone catches on that you are playing with their emotions it is fairly easy for them to resist it (you can numb their anger/indignation at being messed with, but a person can summon more anger than you can soothe away).

  While brass does not allow you to increase the intensity of emotions, skilful allomancers can achieve a similar effect by soothing away all emotions except the one they want their target to focus on. If you want someone to be scared, for instance, you could soothe away whatever other emotions are currently vying for their attention to make the fear they are naturally feeling stand out more. 

  One other thing that perhaps goes without saying, but while the effects of allomancy are temporary, you can still use it to influence what people are thinking in the long run. For instance, if you want someone to not freak out about some new piece of information, you can soothe away their fear and anger while you tell them about it. Then once they remember the conversation after the allomantic effects have worn off, they will remember being pretty blasé about it and (depending on the person in question) the brain's desire for consistency might kick in and justify their reaction by make up some kind of reason why it wasn't that big of a deal.

  The maximum number of people you can influence at a time is dependent on your skill as an allomancer, but a rough upper bound might be a large room full of people. You do not strictly need line of sight to your targets, but it does make it easier.

  Any aluminium placed between your center of mass and the targets head prevents you from targeting their emotions and extremely strong emotions in the target can interfere with (though not outright block) your abilities. Non-humans are susceptible to soothing to an extent directly proportional to their level of sapience (so you're not going to soothe an ant, but you might be able to soothe a gorilla or a dolphin or even a particularly smart dog). 

  **Feruchemy**

  Feruchemic brass allows you to store heat. When storing heat, the feruchemists body cools down and when tapping heat the feruchemists body warms up. This ability allows the feruchemist to exists comfortably across a wide range of temperatures, a feruchemist with enough heat stored can walk naked through a blizzard without freezing to death and (with enough unfilled brass) run through a desert in thick clothing without breaking a sweat.

  In both of those examples the feruchemist maintains a body temperature of 37 °C and simply siphons of the excess heat/cold, but brass also allows a feruchemist to raise or lower their body temperature to beyond what a human body can normally function under. There are limits to this though, a feruchemist storing heat can drop their body temperature to roughly 0 °C before the effects of hypothermia set in and when tapping heat they can reach temperatures of around 200 °C before they start burning themselves. 

  Note that these numbers are the upper limits before physical damage starts to happen, the feruchemist is going to feel pretty miserable long before that.

  While feruchemy does not make one immune to heat and cold in excess of your body temperature, heating up your body to above the ambient temperature does, by virtue of thermodynamics, mean that you are not getting any warmer (and vice versa for cold). 

  A brass feruchemist thus has two ways of dealing with extreme heat: either raising their body temperature above the ambient temperature or storing away the incoming heat to keep their body at a reasonable temperature.  The latter tactic is much more comfortable for the feruchemist, but only really works when dealing with moderate, ambient heat because feruchemy always works on the entire body at once. In order to not burn your hands when putting them in boiling water you'd have to store about 50 °C, which means the temperature in the rest of your body also drops by 50 °C (which kills you).
  ```

    Like with tin, I had to fill in some of the gaps on how feruchemic brass actually works in order to make it specific enough for this thread. Like before, I don't think anything up here contradicts canon/WoB, but due to time constraints I didn't dig in as deep as I did with tin, so apologies if I missed anything.

    There are a bunch of IRL obligations coming up so I suspect I will be skipping the next week or two and come back in the second week of the new year with the next metal: zinc.

      One thing before munchkinnery; the third paragraph says you are interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, which I think is a typo.

      Anyway, the allomancy can be used in a strange way to generate negentropy if used in the far future. If you stored a single consciousness inside a massive structure like a Matrioshka brain, and deliberately made it inefficient by making it take a lot of energy to simulate, say, anger, then by soothing that anger you can create a massive energy gap that will mean more heat flows to the point where the anger is simulated. That's a really awkward way of doing things, but it works, since it's one mind. Theoretically, if sapience allows the allomancer to increase the dampening if the target is more intelligent than a human, then the process could be even better.

      As for less far flung things, (for a definition of that) the fact that 'feelings' are so vague might mean that you could dampen really esoteric things to communicate silently. As an example, I might discuss with my companion that dampening their feeling of heat in their left big toe means 'Danger!', while dampening in their right big toe means 'I'm bluffing'. You could do this with less esoteric things, but this would be the way to do it with the least amount of knock-on effects, I believe.

      There is the obvious benefit with allomancy that you essentially have an objective test of sapience, if you can detect the ease of numbing a mind's emotions. This would be useful for AI, and also making sure that we haven't accidently been committing murder of sapient minds in animal testing.

      A feruchemist could use lemon juice or urine based invisible ink without having to have access to a portable heater. This could have an (admittedly niche) use during covert operations. They can use it by raising their body temperature until it starts to show.

      A feruchemist could temperature sensors fixed on their body to wordlessly and motionlessly trigger various weapons and devices, which could be useful if they are caught in a 'Do anything and I shoot you' situation.

      I'm starting to think that a bronze feruchemist could be really good at stealth operations, as another use of the ability is making their heat signiture without fancy gadgets, rendering them near immune to IR detection.

      That's all I have for now - at first I thought bronze feruchemy wouldn't be very useful, but this exercise had given me something to think about. Also, the idea of a spy in bronze plate seems hilarious to me, even if they probably wouldn't wear exactly that if it turned out to be useful.

        > the third paragraph says you are interested in what a pewter twinborn compounder can do, which I think is a typo.

        Whoops, corrected now. Thanks!

        >If you stored a single consciousness inside a massive structure like a Matrioshka brain, and deliberately made it inefficient by making it take a lot of energy to simulate, say, anger, then by soothing that anger you can create a massive energy gap that will mean more heat flows to the point where the anger is simulated.

        Ooh, this is very clever. I like it.

        > As for less far flung things, (for a definition of that) the fact that 'feelings' are so vague might mean that you could dampen really esoteric things to communicate silently.

        I think your example here is a little too esoteric, but soothing away hunger -> 'Danger', soothing away fatigue -> 'I'm bluffing' should work. With practice you can probably distinguish a pretty wide scala of emotions, especially if the soother is deliberately trying to not be subtle about it.

        > There is the obvious benefit with allomancy that you essentially have an objective test of sapience, 

        I thought about this too, but the trick is figuring out a way to objectively test to what extent emotions are being soothed. Sapience is gradient, not an on/off switch (at least it is in the cosmere universe apparently), so you'd have to be able to quantify to what extent two differently designed brains are experiencing an emotion. Seems like that would be tricky. 

        > A feruchemist could temperature sensors fixed on their body to wordlessly and motionlessly trigger various weapons and devices

        Remember that you can't heat up specific parts of your body, so all you'd be able to send to the sensors is a single number (and even then you'd be limited by the precision with which you can tap and store heat). You could still do things like "Raise temp to 40°C then drop temp to 30 °C -> detonate explosives", so it isn't that big of  a deal, but it will reduce the speed at which you can send triggers.

        >another use of the ability is making their heat signiture without fancy gadgets, rendering them near immune to IR detection.

        Neat! Yeah, that would absolutely work.

        reworking your silent communications thing instead of making "your big toe going numb means im bluffing" you could make someone you want to know your bluffing feel like your bluffing -is there precedent for controlling more specific emotions like that?- tell them if they have a hunch or feeling for something your doing then theyre right.

        with the 'zombies' a  benefit of emotional control over them instead of the ?real? method is that they could still do complex tasks. and if you dampen all of there feelings beside the ones for the task your doing and theyll do it whole heartedly, maybe making them even better than when they were normal. and for a compounder they shouldnt be hard to make - if burning brass with stored heat in it makes your allomancy power stronger then you could dampen any aversion they have to you brass them, and bronze them harder (not that heat storage and emotional dampening would compound like that, im presuming its the rules of compounding in general).

        edit- noticed the zombie army thing is from another commenter, not you.

        edit 2- changed bronze to brass thx

        with the fighting entropy thing all of the powers have had good ability there, and instead of hooking someone up to a neg entropy engine you could store and release heat/cold in place A-place B and you have an easy displacement going on. with the benefit that your not limited by how much brass to burn or how much heat(or whatever your converting to emotion) there is in the universe.
        ```

        - u/Silver_Swift:
          ```
          > is there precedent for controlling more specific emotions like that?

          You could soothe away suspicion, which would make the target more likely to believe you are not bluffing. Maybe soothe away nervousness and fear to make them believe you are bluffing (depending on what exactly you're bluffing about)? 

          > not that heat storage and emotional dampening would compound like that, im presuming its the rules of compounding in general

          Unfortunately you can't use compounding to enhance your allomancy, all compounding does is give you a limitless supply of feruchemically stored attributes. 

          In fact, burning a feruchemically charged bit of metal does not even give you its allomantic effect at all. Burning a piece of brass with heat stored gives you (more) heat back, it doesn't let you soothe emotions.

          Also, minor nitpick: brass is the metal that lets you store heat/dampen emotions, bronze does something else.

          > with the fighting entropy thing all of the powers have had good ability there, and instead of hooking someone up to a neg entropy engine you could store and release heat/cold in place A-place B and you have an easy displacement going on. with the benefit that your not limited by how much brass to burn or how much heat(or whatever your converting to emotion) there is in the universe.

          Yup, brass is definitely one of the more straightforward negentropy generating powers in feruchemy's arsenal, but keep in mind that you can only heat yourself to around 200°C. I suspect you'd have to do some pretty clever tricks to counteract significant amounts of entropy that way.
          ```

      - u/Frommerman:
        ```
        A brass feruchemist can counter negentropy on their own by consistently charging in one place and discharging in another. They wouldn't be able to produce much negentropy on their own, but sufficient advances in biological engineering should make it possible to make massive implants which count as parts of their body, massively increasing the amount of energy they can move.

        If you have one full Feruchemist you could use them and an orbiting loop of brass baubles to do this without moving the Feruchemist. Aluminum lets you store identity, and if a Feruchemist stores all of their identity while storing another attribute, the resulting metalmind will be usable by anyone. So, put the heavily modified Feruchemist with a huge body on one side of the last black hole, put a bunch of people on the other, an orbiting ring of countless brass beads between them, and you will create a radiative wind accross the black hole, which could be harvested the same way you would harvest any other black hole.

    Why, make a zombie army of course. Having one person Sooth away people's feeling of volition while another does more intensive emotional editting would get rid of the downside of "be able to be fought against". As any major depressive or schizophrenic person could tell you, it's *really hard* to care that you're currently e.g. literally starving if you're in the throws of avolition.

    [Hoodoo zombi](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Serpent_and_the_Rainbow_(book)) are maybe-real, but were very intensive to make due to having to induce ego death and delirium chemically and killing people due to high variance in toxicity of datura root. If you can just tamp down someone's willpower, self of self, feeling of resistance, self regard, etcetera etcetera for a week and feed them propaganda through it, you can probably make an army.

    I'd just test limits and see what you can do, tbh. "Emotions" is a really broad category. It sounds like it's be something like "external force changing your mind", but "loyalty" is a more passive state of mind. I'd try more esoteric things, like "self-possession" or "comprehension" and see if those work - if you feel less self-possessed then you'd be off balance and vicious circle down to feeling completely out of control, hopefully having a panic attack, while if you lose the feeling of comprehension of what's going on you might start self-doubting and vicious circle down, even if you intellectually understand things still.

    Something like soothing "self-doubt" sounds like it'd be pretty dangerous, since you could run around and get people to make bad decisions they would usually hedge against, with the same kind of self-rationalization for once you stop. Depending on the range of soothing, you could influence heads of state, or else just sweep people in poker.

    You could become the best mental hospital orderly ever seen, or provide suppression for drug cravings at a rehab. Sooth away mania, depression, psychosis, etc.

    Alternatively, if you're on Earth, influence elections - politicians having bad emotional reactions or not being able to build up enthusiasm for a talking point on live TV would kill support very quickly, and debates or rallys are done in front of large audiences.

  Incredibly mild mechanical spoilers for *The Return of the Obra Dinn* follow.

  ----

  You have come into possession of the **Momento Mortem**, a magical object that looks like a wind-up pocket watch. This magic item has several properties:

  * If you point it at a corpse, the hands of the pocket-watch will spin around to show the time of death.
  * If you press the button on the top of the pocket-watch while it's pointed at a corpse, two effects happen:
    * You will hear five seconds of audio from the time and location where the person or animal died.
    * Following that, you will be transported to a sphere of frozen space-time roughly 10 meters wide, depicting the exact moment of death, centered on the corpse. You can move freely around this bubble of frozen space-time, though solid objects are still solid to you, and nothing can be moved. When you leave (requiring an act of will), two seconds will have passed, no matter how much time you spend looking around. If you find a corpse in this chunk of frozen time, you can recursively use the Momento Mortem to investigate it, resulting in being 'transported' to a new chunk of frozen time and hearing five seconds of audio.
  * For the purposes of this prompt, 'time of death' will be assigned according to either destruction of the brain or cessation of brain activity.
  * For the purposes of this prompt, 'corpse' is defined as any distinct piece of a dead member of a species of the animal kingdom larger than 50 cubic centimeters and relatively intact (e.g. the item won't work on a slurry made of different people, as they're not distinct, and won't work on a deer that's eaten a corpse, as it's not intact).
  * You can bring in up to 25 kilograms of equipment and clothing into the slice of frozen time with you, but no changes to you or them will carry over to the real world when you exit, and interaction with the objects is in terms of light only, as they repel all touch.

  Given the above, answer at least one of the below:

  1. How do you use this item to satisfy your values?
  2. How do you use this item to most effectively solve the most crimes?
  3. If this item is in someone else's possession, what's your standard operating procedure to not get caught when you commit your murders?
  4. If you live in a society which can produce more of this item on demand, what different laws would you make regarding it?
  ```

  - u/KilotonDefenestrator:
    ```
    (1) Learning! Work or live somewhere with easy access to dead animals (if frozen counts as "relatively intact" I'd just have a freezer with a frozen 50cm^2 piece of an animal killed in a suitable place to study), and spend 2 seconds reading, re-reading and reflecting on any amount of text you can reasonably bring with you using the 25kg limit. Might have a special set of pants with soft cushioning around the buttocks to sit comfortably on the time-frozen furniture. 

    It is unclear from your description if the pages in a book you brought with you could be turned, but its seems reasonable - presumable worn clothes deform to allow you to move around in the sphere, or you'd have to use the Memento Mortem naked. 

    (3) Always kill people from more than 10 meters to avoid visual identification is a good first step. 

    Also, pick a method of killing that prevents the victim from speaking, making signs or writing, and that at the same time takes as long as possible (at least over 5 seconds) before the brain activity shuts down, so that the details of the crime like direction of attack etc are not readily apparent.
    ```

    - u/jtolmar:
      ```
      I'd expect the same techniques from your (1) to work for sleeping too. It'd be really weird if whatever chemical changes to your brain created by learning are preserved but not the ones from sleep. (Then again it's magic, it can work however it wants, but that's not an excuse not to check.) Bring a sleeping bag if time-frozen furniture is uncomfortable. There's an extra 8 hours a day, plus the ability to rest up and collect your thoughts whenever you want.

      There's also physical science to be examined using time stops. Anything someone currently studies with a high speed camera can be studied in more depth by killing some mice at the right moment. You can't do fundamental physics research in the bubble because it's clearly futzing with the rules for at least light propagation (I mean, that'd still be interesting science to do, but you'd be learning about magic-physics instead of regular-physics), but I expect there's something in engineering, medical, or biomechanical research that would save enough lives to be worth killing mice for. Structural engineers looking at the exact way a stress fracture propagates?

      Finally, because you can use the Memento Mortem recursively, if you have any of these uses that require cleverly chosen corpses and moments of death, you can preserve all of them into an index by getting a bunch of corpses in one spot and sacrificing an animal (which you preserve traditionally until it's getting musty, then chain in a new animal). You can make an index of indices. In fact, for (2) an the local morgue can sacrifice a mouse every so often and later add them all to a huge index of every death that's passed through there.

    If someone dies within the sphere, do they come back dead, or not at all? If the first, one could send in a hibernating animal with a computer with a nuclear battery, then use its corpse to read off the display in a frozen-sphere snapshot of a frozen sphere, gathering months of computational time without spending sanity.

    The time-freeze aspect of this pocket watch kind of overwhelms everything else. Sure you could use the watch to find murderers, but that's a really mundane use of having an object that FREEZES TIME. I would spend all my time constantly entering such frozen time spaces so I can do all the thinking I need in there. 

    The fact that you can bring in items with you makes things even better, you can bring in video games for entertainment whenever you get bored, or a computer to help you calculate things and store all your thoughts. The fact that these objects are effectively memory wiped when you leave is a problem, but that just means you need to improve your memory. Or just make multiple trips, memorize one chunk of a story or proof you wrote at a time.

    The only real problem is that you need constant access to corpses in order to abuse this frozen space-time. Can you just buy a whole duck (from a restaurant) and keep it frozen in your fridge forever? That's probably the easiest method if it works.

    how do mirrors work? if mirrors from the sphere reflect stuff outside then something that would help detectives is if every one went around wearing stupid amounts of reflective clothing.

    or if it worked within the rules (which this is a stretch) then detectives could bring mirrors in to see outside the allotted range (though if your eyes cant see out of it then i dont see why a mirror could).  


    something murderers could do is make there crime scenes incredibly dangerous to investigate. spider webs are harmless but if you accidentally walked through a time frozen one you would probably be cut in half before you realized what happened, though you would just leave before you would die. murderers shooting off confetti canons will stop investigators from walking around. or you could try to be deviouse and use something hard to see like hairs or whatever the smallest piece of dust would have to be for you to not be able to move it. another way to attack people investigating would be powerful fuck off lazers. not that you need to harm the detectives, allot of bright lights could blind detectives and stop them from seeing in the crime scene bubble (though some goggles to dampen light would fix that).  


    just spit balling a few more ideas here but if you spray painted the air would it stick to dust particles and such to show you where vacuums are (that someone has recently been). or if you could use a corpse to disappear for a few seconds (away from authority's or murderer's?), - not sure what good 2 seconds is though.  


    easiest and most obviouse way id use this is kill a chicken within range of a chicken corpse, bring a weeks worth of food and a laptop with a terabyte of learning material, maybe some instruments and spend my free decade inside learning, using up only 2 seconds of my life span. or forget being a robot bring a few terrabytes filled with shows/books/comics and do it again. if someone said i could spend a decade doing either of those things and it wouldnt effect anything else you'd have to wait 2 seconds for my answer.

  Vim is the force of creation and can be used to conjure objects or heat them. Nix is the force of uncreation and can be used to vanish objects or cool them. Both can be used to telekinetically move objects around or to infuse matter. 

  Infusion:
  - Transfers vim or nix into matter for storage.
  - Stored vim or nix has a one hour half life, except for crystals which have a one year half life.
  - Matter infused with vim can't be directly affected by nix and vice-versa. 
  - Vim-infused matter can be de-infused by spending 10x the vim in nix and vice versa.


  Limitations:

  *Specificity:* You can only conjure or vanish one compound at a time. For example, you could conjure salt (NaCl) but not a bag of french fries to go with it.

  *Comprehension:* You have to know the bonds in the conjured molecule as well as the molecule's shape. Magicians study a lot of chemistry. 

  *Conservation:* Mass and energy are both conserved. Conjuring objects gathers atoms from nearby. Vanishing them disperses the atoms over the same area. Heating draws energy from nearby. Cooling disperses that heat.

  *Displacement:* Conjured objects displace the matter around them. Vanished objects leave a vacuum.

  *Elements:* Conjuring or vanishing compounds with more elements takes exponentially longer.

  *Pathing:* You have to specify a path from the vim/nix source to the target point. Paths for nix can't go through matter infused with vim. Paths for vim can't go through matter infused with nix. Spells with longer paths cost more to cast. Five meters is a normal casting range. Shorter paths cost much, much less, up to 1/100th at a few centimeters.

  *Targeting:* You can increase the precision of targeting conjuration, vanishing, etc, but as the precision goes below 1cm the cost approaches infinity rapidly. A precision of 1mm costs 10x, 0.1mm is 1000x.

  *Whole:* You can only conjure or vanish entire objects. An "object" is a group of identical bonded molecules. For example, a layer of oil between two sheets of steel could be vanished, but two separate pockets of oil inside a steel block couldn't (though you could vanish them separately).

  The average magician can channel 6000 units of vim or nix per second, enough to let them:
  - Conjure or vanish 0.5kg of matter, assuming the atoms are plentiful. The cost increases if they aren't.
  - Apply 30kN of force.
  - Transfer 12kJ of energy from two objects that start at equal temperature. The cost increases if you're trying to cool a cold object or heat a hot one.

  These rates are mutually exclusive. If you're conjuring half a kg of matter, you can't also push stuff around. Note also that these are the base rates. Spending all 6k units on force targeting a person a hundred meters away will result in less force than a light breeze because the path is so long.

  Conjuration and vanishing doesn't happen all at once. You get the effects as you pay, growing outward from the targeted point. So, for example, if you conjured a large metal ball you would first see a small marble that swelled and grew until it was as big as you wanted. Or if you wanted to break into a padlocked room, you could start a vanishing on the hasp and wait until a cross-section had been vanished before stopping the spell.

  Any suggestions would be much appreciated. I've gone over this a couple times but there's probably something I'm missing. I've already got the obvious weaponized use of conjuration by putting a bullet in someone's head, but I'm more interested in techniques that would work against a fellow caster. I think it's inevitable that in any hard magic system the non-mages will just flat out lose to mages.

  Edit: Oh, and the strain of channelling vim or nix gradually causes permanent insanity over decades of use.

    * What area are vanished objects dispersed over? And are compounds broken into their constituent elements? As an example, what does salt vanish into? Can you sneak into the basement of the building your enemy is in and just start vanishing loads of salt to disperse sodium metal and chlorine gas throughout the building? 
    * Can you infuse compressed gas with nix and then vanish it to create a (short-lived) vim-nullification zone?
    * Also, it's interesting that telekinesis is limited by force rather than by energy output. With the right mechanism, you can pump theoretically infinite energy out of it. (The actual limits would be determined by material properties. Too extreme a gear ratio and you'll bust the gears apart.) Is the kinetic energy pulled out of the surroundings? That might be a faster way to cool things than using vim directly. 
    * It would be neat to weaponize the heat draw of vim-heating to flash freeze the area around the target, but the rates involved are too low for that to be an effective attack.That raises the question: If you have a lump of nix infused matter next to the target of vim-heating, does the heat get drawn from the nix matter, or is it shielded from that secondary effect?

  You can create matter out of nothing from this list: rock, stone, wood, clay, iron, and glass. The matter disappears after an hour. You can create batches between 1-5 kg at a time and the batch must be connected. You can't create matter inside a solid object though if you create it within an empty area it doesn't fit(such as between your palm and the wall) it will assert pressure onto the surrounding area to try to create such space. You can only create very simple shapes. After you have created the matter it will follow the natural rules of physics and you have no more control. Matter are created with a velocity of 0 with respect to your current position and at a temperature that matches the surrounding temperature. 

  Setting is medieval.

  I haven't really found any utility uses for this power. Offensive uses basicly boils down to creating something in front of someone when they are running, creating an iron lump over their head or inside their mouth/nose. Ideas? I was really hoping for something that could be used to generate coin but I'm commin up short.

    What happens if you burn the wood and someone breathes the product?
    Do they die horribly of transfiguration sickness?. 

    If that doesn't happen you can use it to get unlimited fuel basically.

    Also you can transport  stuff by creating things near it so the pressure pushes them. 

    And cut stuff, assuming you can make thin  sheets of iron or glass. 
    (you could cut and process trees whith this for example) 

    Also a few questions :

    How far can you make the batches appear?

    How fast?

    How much pressure can the object assert ? 

    Depending on the answers I see multiple ways of making wmd.
