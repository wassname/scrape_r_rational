  If you can make a backup copy of someone and restore it into a new body, which is something that's probably not too far from their capabilities (easy for any civilization that has duplicative teleportation) you can do anything you want to them as often as you want and nobody will ever ever know about it.

  It's a nasty twist on "identity theft".
