  I haven't read that story. Can you give a better description of sweet and what you're looking for?

  - u/Mountebank:
    ```
    Sweet, or Antonio Darling, is the Bishop of the Thieve's Guild, a publicly recognized and protected--but mostly disliked--religious order whose mandate is to fight corrupt abuses of power. Sweet is the quintessential people person: he's everyone's friend, he knows everyone by name, and they know him.
    ```

- u/Vielfras8:
  ```
  Calvaron the Centaur, a broker of secrets in the magic school of Wistram.  
  Appears from the 1st chapter of a 7ch short story "Wistram Days" set in the Wandering Inn universe.
