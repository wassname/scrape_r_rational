  Was she raised homeless? I'm somewhat confused because my understanding of Tehran was that it was roughly equivalent (economically, at least) to an American metropolitan city, where I'd be thoroughly shocked to find someone (with applied knowledge of chemistry) willing to repeatedly commit suicide and subject themselves and those who they claim to be helping to participating in cannibalism.

  Assuming other things (not just the body, but clothing as well?) are duplicated along with the person, any number of other uses could be found. What happens when something copied with the body is dropped?

  If only the body is copied, there are still other possibilities. What happens when the copy picks up/eats/etc something and then dematerializes? Could be used as a form of 100% safe nuclear waste disposal, perhaps?

  Hell, even without all of that, being able to reliably produce identical medical experiment subjects/cadavers should be worth more than enough money to be able to simply buy the food that she is wanting to provide, while having none of the risks associated with violating such a massive taboo as cannibalism.

    I was expecting that Zahra would have to live elsewhere in Iran, but as I was doing my research for her, it turned out that Tehran has a **really** awful wealth gap--one report that I found estimated that [between 44.5% and 55% of the city's population are below the poverty line](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/03/irans-cities-a-sea-of-poverty.html). On the other hand, ["nearly all of Iran's national government officials are multimillionaires"](http://borgenproject.org/poverty-tehran/). 

    On top of that, [unemployment has been rising](http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=30424:poverty-grows-as-iranian-government-resists-change&catid=4:iran-general&Itemid=109) for at least the past few years and [wages have been dropping](http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=30064:poverty-in-iran-reaches-new-heights&catid=4:iran-general&Itemid=109)--in many cases past the point necessary to households to be fully fed.

    This is where I might be guilty of steelmanning a little too much. I'm not sure if it has more to do with my own personality when I was a theist or with my irritation with lukewarm and inconsistent theists, but my religious characters tend to take their faith very seriously. Zahra doesn't just believe that she believes, but genuinely **believes**, that she has an immortal soul and a duty to sacrifice herself if that is what is necessary. 

    [A note: According to a blog post that I happened to come across quite recently, it may be that Zahra is even more of an oddity among Iranian Christians than she would be among American Christians. I hope to dig up more on that before we come back to Zahra.]

    Whoops! I thought that it might detract from the flow of the story, but in retrospect I probably could have dropped a quick mention to clarify this. I should go back and edit a line about this into the part where she's talking about how useless her power seemed to be, but here you go: 

    Clothing is duplicated. Things that are not clothing (e.g. bars of gold) are not duplicated. Yes, her power distinguishes between "clothing" and "not clothing," and it does so in a way that probably agrees with the intuitions of most people. Zahra doesn't think that this is weird, since God gave her this talent so of course God can fine-tune it however God likes. 

    Clothing vanishes if the duplicate would vanish, but stays if the duplicate would stay (i.e. if Zahra-2 has died, then her clothing will stay). 

    > If only the body is copied, there are still other possibilities. What happens when the copy picks up/eats/etc something and then dematerializes? Could be used as a form of 100% safe nuclear waste disposal, perhaps?

    She could probably be used as a form of nuclear waste disposal, because the sangak that the duplicate eats is always gone when the duplicate vanishes. 

    > Hell, even without all of that, being able to reliably produce identical medical experiment subjects/cadavers should be worth more than enough money to be able to simply buy the food that she is wanting to provide, while having none of the risks associated with violating such a massive taboo as cannibalism.

    Google informs me that Iran has less problems with research cadavers than I (for some reason) assumed, but I am still under the impression that cadavers are donated, not sold. If I'm wrong, then hopefully it doesn't break suspension of disbelief that Zahra has the same (wrong) understanding and didn't even bother with that approach. 

    Thank you for reading and for taking the time to comment!

    Yeah, I mean, surely just duplicating yourself and continuing to hold hands you should be able to get more done to alleviate poverty and misery than all this.  If you are willing to literally kill yourself and feed yourself to people then you could think of any number of things like: hard physical labor that might injure yourself (carrying hundreds of pounds of water to people who need it), taking care of sick and diseased that most people would avoid, or just working really really hard and whenever your other you gets tired or hungry make a new one - labor that doesn't need to drink, eat, sleep, and never gets tired seems pretty valuable.

    If you absolutely must die, might as well die in a way that preserves your organs and flood the donor market.  Or even donate blood/marrow/kidneys and take the money to buy food for the starving - though it might be difficult to do that with the hand holding thing.  Could simply claim it was for moral support or some such, though that wouldn't fly for kidney donation for obvious reasons.
