  Wow. This is some excellent world-building, and is exactly the scale of atrocity I'd imagined the Doc had committed. It's ethically ambiguous at almost every level and makes me *very* excited to learn more about these experiments. The formal tone and [REDACTED] give this chapter an almost SCP feel, which I like.

  It's also interesting how this ruling paints the ICJ to be almost as much of a villain as the Doc. By censoring his science, they're ensuring (at least until he finds the fountain of youth) that all those poor people were tortured in vain. In our timeline, Nazi experiments are still the best source of data we have on how humans freeze to death; it would have been a crime against humanity if the Allies had shredded all of Mengele's documentation. That said, it points to the horrific nature of that redacted appendix, which presumably so repulsed the ICJ that they decided hurting Doc Stevens was worth the information cost.

  Great chapter, looking forward to next week.

  P.S. The last line made me cringe, though. "Juices" is a *weird* word to use for a harvest. Maybe "we all eat of its fruit"?

  Delphic is a superhero story about Hector, a young man in Detroit with the ability to see the past and the present. It follows his attempts to leverage this unusual ability to do good in the world while remaining behind the scenes, keeping both his identity and the truth of his powers secret from those who would see him as a threat.

  Story threads will focus on several characters as Hector encounters them:

  * Hector's sister, Paris, a homicide detective hiding her own power,
  * Doc Stevens, a disgraced scientist at the forefront of research on the source of super powers, and
  * The exploits of various "Super Teams": government-run groups of supers whose scope of operations have been steadily growing.
