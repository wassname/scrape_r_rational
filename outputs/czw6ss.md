  This comic hasn't been reposted in four years ([link 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/2ouxcm/xrisktransdimensional_brain_chip/), [link 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/35ayz7/transdimensional_brain_chip_now_finished/)), so I think it's time. The art is godawful and the beginning is very slow (A/B testing is the first thing any moron would do with this power, which makes sense since Ulf starts out the story as a random moron but is boring to get through) but once it gets going it gets _really_ good. Existential risk, the anthropic principle, weaponized memetics, applied utilitarianism... truly a must-read for any rationalist.

    Thank you, I hadn't seen this before.  


    Though, I wish you hadn't posted this at the *time* you did, as you've dramatically reduced the chances of me getting a good night's sleep. ;)

  I like the gimmick where time is down, alternate universes are side by side. Simple yet clever.

  Sometimes I amuse myself by thinking that Coil from Worm is Ulf in disguise due to their powers being very similar to each other.

  that was utterly terrifying. i loved it.

  I'm about halfway through. This is fucking hilarious. Making the protagonist an idiot was definitely the right move.

  Edit: Wow, that >!really escalated!<! It was a lot of fun. One thing I'm confused about: How did >!Aisha manage to outnumber Ulf? Every time one of herselves split, shouldn't that have created a new universe with a new brain-virused, chip-connected Ulf!<? Or maybe >!it wasn't literally creating new universes, just connecting her with similar ones, but it still shouldn't have been possible for her to outnumber him because there'd still be a chip-connected Ulf in every universe she connected to by pressing the button in a universe where she hadn't defeated him yet!<. Maybe >!there were multiple, isolated Ulf networks, each of which originated with a different universe's Original Ulf getting the surgery, and Aisha was able to access universes across more than one Ulf network while each Ulf could only access within his own network!<? I guess that last idea works, although there might be a simpler solution I haven't thought of.
  ```

  - u/xamueljones:
    ```
    You are thinking that >!every time Aisha clicked the remote a new universe was created, but if you reread the very first comic, you'll see that the universe is naturally splitting over and over every second. The remote is just connecting Aisha with another Aisha from an identical universe that split at the same time as the remote being pressed. So Ulf doesn't split when Aisha does.!<
    ```

- u/zaxqs:
  ```
  Plot hole: >!The button is too powerful. As soon as Aisha had figured out how to make it safe to expand, she could have simply precommitted to pressing the button a bunch of times, so that all her split-offs would press it too, yielding exponential growth. She must have done something like this to get a network of 10 million within 3 days. But the story vastly underestimates that kind of growth. She could have easily gotten a network bigger than the square of Ulf's within *one minute*, as soon as it was possible to spread with impunity. Then she could have easily outclassed Ulf's network in any world with better antivirus technology, and once she had done it once she could have done the same in every world in her network.!<

  >!The biggest plothole isn't really that Aisha didn't do that, however. It's that *Ulf* somehow didn't manage to figure out how to speed up the splitting process in his chip, especially since it was apparently an arbitrary limitation. He specifically shows that he has access to brain-computer interface technology, and yet not one of his millions of copies figured that it should work on improving his chip, or even just removing the timer, given that it too is brain-computer interface technology, and it's the most useful piece of technology he has! It doesn't make sense to argue that he was distracted by his world manipulation or his religious wars either: world manipulation becomes much easier the more computing power you have, and the first religious faction to successfully remove the timer from the chip would instantly and totally dominate the network.!<

  I remember reading it a while ago and was confused by everything that happened after the final confrontation.  Like, I get how that conflict ended, and I understand what the new situation is, I just don't get how they went from one to the other.  

  The final time skip, IMO, skipped just a little bit too much.
  ```

  - u/CeruleanTresses:
    ```
    I think we're meant to infer that >!once Aisha defeated Ulf, she set about implementing her own vision of utopia, which is what we see in the epilogue. We don't really need to know exactly how she did that; we saw how easily Ulf took over Earth once his own smarts and resources had snowballed enough, so we can assume that Aisha similarly took over Earth with ease as soon as her competition was out of the way.!<

  I think the good ol' reddit hug struck again. Is there a mirror by chance?

  If you get the power to split into four time lines or split once and then split again at a separate time what would you do?

  Power works like this does, you can fade in and out, you can communicate by thought, to pay attention you can't be distracted.

  Isn't it best to split into four immediately? But then the time lines will drift apart.

  Perhaps you wait until before a big decision?

  One use is during exams you can assign each of you to a specific topic then copy each other during the exam. Of course then you won't learn everything which could be an issue.

  That was amazing! Thanks for bringing it to my attention.

  Good story. And pretty good arc structure too.

    You think? I thought it was >!bittersweet at worst. The post-Aisha world seems overall better off than ours, Aisha is happy even if it's via self-brain-hack, and Ulf is basically fine even if he can't be fully happy in relationships with baseline humans!<.

  Thanks, that was great. Are any of the author's other comics any good?

    [_Lies, Sisters and Wives_](http://lies.thecomicseries.com/) is crap; just one long comedy of errors with no rational themes. Skip it.

    [_The Accidental Space Spy_](http://spacespy.thecomicseries.com/) is not as good as _Transdimensional Brain Chip_, but it's still worth reading. It's about this guy who gets mistaken for a space spy and is forced to travel to many different alien worlds while trying to solve a mystery. Each planet has a different species of alien, each with their own unique evolutionary psychology and physiology. Think [_Three Worlds Collide_](http://web.archive.org/web/20090704030515/http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/) minus the game theory.

    I haven't read [_Hitmen For Destiny_](http://hitmen.thecomicseries.com/) or [_Trixie Slaughteraxe for President_](http://trixie.webcomic.ws/comics/first/).
