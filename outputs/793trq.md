## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Another week with scant code progress. I recently had decided that I was going to attempt to go to bed by 11 PM each night (as opposed to 1:30-2 AM) and I think I’m discovering that I used 9-11 to unwind and 11-1ish to actually get stuff done.  This is a bit frustrating, as I don’t *like* not making progress, but on the other hand I *am* somewhat concerned about the long-term ramifications of only getting 5-6 hours of sleep a night.  It’s an annoying balance to find.


  Maybe I should try something like two weeks at 11, two weeks when I’m tired.  It’s not the best system, but on the other hand it’s not like I’m getting oodles of sleep regardless due to having a one-year-old.  Maybe I should just power through and re-evaluate once I’m at a point that sleeping in on Saturdays is an option again.


  ----


  There was *one* bit of development, although I was only partially involved.  Thanks to the efforts of /u/gbear605, XGEF can now be built and thus developed using VS2017 on macOS.  (It could already be ran using mono on both macOS and linux, but I had never attempted to *build* on anything other than Windows).  Kudos to him!  


  ----

  Regardless of code progress, there was *oodles* of design discussion, much of which came as a result of the responses to [last week’s topic of pokeball internal capture mechanics](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/77mobw/d_friday_offtopic_thread/don7arq), which actually went on a lot longer than just Friday.  The current solution I’m leaning towards is detailed in that thread, but TL;DR humans should have a small Psychic typing (~10%) that unlike most Psychic types which have it manifest in a separate organ, have it interspersed throughout the white matter of the brain.  Thus, most Psychic types incur a weak penalty to their power when captured and thus exposed to the brief distortion energy of the portal tech, but humans instead have that minor scrambling effect applied to the brain, which, well, isn’t good.  

  It’s a bit handwavey (what isn’t when it comes to pokemon) but as a system it can at least be interacted with and have its boundaries poked, which is my primary concern for something as fundamental as pokeballs.

  I also brought up in that thread the differences in the scientific tradition of the world, basically that it would nearly of necessity be based more on mad science than science: inventors, not theorists.  A more recent era of stability might permit science to grow and flourish, but before then it’s more important that one figure out how to stop the 1000 rampaging monsters around you rather than figuring out the intricacies of *why* the tools you’re using to do this work.

  The topic of individual pokemon resource use came up; I’ll just quote myself on that one:

  >We've actually taken a hybrid approach: having the resource available grants bonuses, but if the resource is unavailable then it is created ex nihilo at greater cost of the pokemon's endurance.  This means that Charizard has a bigger area of effect and burn chance on flamethrower if it has oil to spare, Blastoise is able to hydro pump practically indefinitely and at greater range if surrounded by water, and Venusaur is able to regularly replenish leech seeds/razor leaves if in sufficient sunlight.  However, all of them can still use those moves if they are out of oil/water/sunlight, they'll just tire out much faster and have comparatively weaker effects.  I think this is a necessary realism compromise due to both fun and tactical reasons, but it doesn't bother me too much.

  >I do draw the line at producing boulders out of thin air, however.  In general I'm okay with some moves only being practical when resources are available, such as Surf having such a maddeningly high endurance cost in the absence of water that it just isn't feasible for mere mortals.  This also grants a very simple signal for extremely powerful pokemon ("Shit!  Where did all that lava even *come* from it didn't even break a *sweat* oh *arceus* we're all going to die aren't we").


  ----


  The Trouble with Typing was breached once again, so types have been rearranged for, mmm, maybe the fourth or fifth time.  This time around the major insights that built upon the previous offensive/defensive typing split was that A: not all types have a meaningful offensive profile that is affected by the substance that the target is made of, and B: not all type defensive profiles can be reduced to a single archetype.  Ice pokemon, for instance, might be blubberous, or they might be literally made partially of ice; these will not both react to all incoming attacks in the same way and so are (or should be) two different defense profiles.

  [Here is the current iteration of the typing chart](https://i.imgur.com/M4vHoYx.png).  Note as usual that numbers are relative and not by any means final.  

  One thing to keep in mind while looking at this chart is that it’s an attempt to communicate damage multipliers in cases where *all factors are otherwise equal*.  That means same stats, a solid hit that did not miss, and so on.  Many of the type interactions in canon are an attempt to abstract away dodge chance, damage application, and range, but we have stats and/or mechanics for all those things, so it is no longer necessary to keep them abstracted to a damage multiplier.  

  Basically, the type chart should, as much as possible, reduce down to “I performed a move of X type on a Normal type and then again on a Y type of equal stats, and this is the difference in pure, raw damage incurred”.  Many of the traditional justifications for type interactions (at least, the ones that make sense in the first place and aren’t otherwise an abstraction of a non-damage concept) actually boil down to a special interaction with a *status* applied by that type instead.  


  A Fire type, for instance, might not necessarily be hurt by a fire hose any more than an average pokemon would.  After all, the flames coming out of it aren’t (too) magical, it’s just for the most part ignited oil secreted from the skin.  It’s still secreting the oil, putting it out doesn’t *inherently* affect it.  However, (we could claim), perhaps a Fire pokemon *does* need to run at a higher temperature for the various chemical whatsits to work, so in the *aftermath* of the water hit, it is going to burn fuel to shake off the temperature hit and get back up to high heat.  Described this way, it sounds more like the Fire pokemon is shaking off a Soaked status effect, rather than interacting with a Water attack directly.  

  This indicates to me that (at *least*) one more pass on this typing setup is going to need to be done to figure out what common statuses are inflicted, and ensure that damage multipliers are not taking those into account.  (The Fire/Water example, for instance, is not currently reflected accurately).  


  Oh, and one more slight tangent related to types: each percentage of a given defensive type (which we have been referring to as Substance to avoid conflating the two too much) is going to have stat bonuses/penalties associated with them, which will make up for much of the type interactions that might appear at first glance to be missing from this chart.  Steel Substance, for instance, would grant, say, 20 DEF + 2% DEF per percentage point of Steel that the pokemon’s Substance is made of.  


  ----


  Anyhoo.  Hopefully I can avoid playing Tooth and Tail too much this weekend and push forward on the Unit/Species definitions that are currently next on my to-do list. (That game is too damn good, I’d highly recommend it as it’s on sale at the moment).

    Question: will it be possible (say, through breeding) to adjust Typing, in order to get e.g. Alola-style pokes? Your mention of percentage points is making me wonder.
    ```

    - u/ketura:
      ```
      Yup! There are two main areas where type conversion is a thing, and both revolve around the concept of Normal typing being a vector of mutation. First is breeding, where a high Normal % translates to a higher chance that other elemental typing will be converted to some other type randomly on unit creation. Over generations it is possible to breed a type into a species (if you have a lucky patient zero), and this will be easier on a Rattata than a Gyarados.

      Second pertains to evolutions and the use of HMs. When evolving, a certain portion of Normal % will regularly be converted when upgrading the Pokémon; for instance, an (average) Charmander might go from 20/10/70 Fire/Dragon/Normal to a Charmeleon at 30/15/55 to a Charizard at 40/20/20/20 Fire/Dragon/Flying/Normal. Normal typing is usually the pool from which additional typing is taken (there might be some cases with more specialized transformations, such as Onix turning 50% of its Rock into Steel while evolving). Coincidentally, HMs that add new organs (such as a cooling organ to enable Ice Beam) do so at the expense of Normal typing, so one might need to sacrifice 10% Normal to add 10% Ice, for instance. This means that using HMs on unevolved Pokémon is a risk, for if insufficient Normal typing exists, the Pokémon might be prevented from evolving at all. It also naturally limits the number of diverse HMs that can be used; pure Normal types will be naturally much more flexible where this is concerned.

      It occurs to me that the second might be used as a catalyst for the first, altho I'd have to think through how much of that should affect the inherited typing.

  I had an assignment to do, and I estimated it would take me 12-15 hours. It took me something like 30 hours. I spent basically every waking moment I wasn't at the office on this damn thing for a week. I took a day off work last minute to finish it. 

  Like, I'm normally pretty good at estimating how long I need to do an assignment. There was an assignment for a "harder" unit that took me less time. I've never been down to the wire like that before, where I'm trying as hard as I can but still not getting finished.

  Anyone have any tips for how I can best learn from this experience? My first thought is, I had the assignment since some 2 months ago, I could have spent 1-2 hours a week on it and saved things.

  And I'm trying to think how I "wasted time" to make it 30 hours. I can't think of anything. I think maybe the 2 hours I spent on the beginning on literature review was inefficient and I should have incorporated those into the main assignment-doing-time. Fucking around with LaTeX/BibTeX only wasted maybe 1 or 2 hours. So maybe that's what happened, a "death by a thousand cuts", with a pomodoro here or there wasted?

  I don't know. I feel like such a failure for this, even though it's stupid: I had the resources to do the assignment and I did it, and I'm sure I'll get a good mark (not to humblebrag but I'm on a high distinction average at the moment and I only need a middling credit average to get into the masters programme if I decide that's what I want to do). But I am kind of bummed. Life has been hard lately too, so many things going wrong by my uniquely privileged white western sense of going wrong. Hopefully things will get better. I know I'll kick butt at both my exams, so that's the next thing to focus on.

    That's the big tip I've been given recently.  Just allocate time by subject/unit/job, and invest a fixed number of hours in each thing daily, until you completely run out of things to do for it.  Then start working ahead.

    >Fucking around with LaTeX/BibTeX only wasted maybe 1 or 2 hours.

    That's actually very, very little.

    >But I am kind of bummed. Life has been hard lately too, so many things going wrong by my uniquely privileged white western sense of going wrong. 

    You know, at a certain part I started thinking, "oh fuck all that 'privileged Western sense' shit".  Because right now the "privileged" world is in nonstop crisis and catastrophe.  So fuck it, we get to feel legitimately bad right now.

      Yeah, I think I should have done the "working ahead" on the assignment rather than "I have read every single reading and every single lecture that is currently available, time to watch TV!" that I actually did. 

      >>Fucking around with LaTeX/BibTeX only wasted maybe 1 or 2 hours.

      >That's actually very, very little.

      And my partner waxes lyrical about LaTeX being such a timesaver??? Then again another student was talking about how she spent tons of time on her margins and fonts which I spent 0 time on, so maybe I'm not doing so bad. And I likely spent comparatively little time on my references too...

      >You know, at a certain part I started thinking, "oh fuck all that 'privileged Western sense' shit". Because right now the "privileged" world is in nonstop crisis and catastrophe. So fuck it, we get to feel legitimately bad right now.

      As I said in another comment, I actually was feeling bad for being a priviledged *Australian* since I have a job I basically can't get fired from (for real) and can take last minutes days off and an extremely cheap system of student loans that I only have to pay back when I earn over a certain salary. You were talking about losing your job, and I felt kind of bad writing a whole bunch of stuff about "an assignment I'm doing for a course for a qualification that earns less than the job I'm doing now was hard and I feel sad". Was trying to be sensitive.

  Content note: whining

  I am dissatisfied with my life. My life isn't currently that awful, but isn't where I would have hoped it would be if you had asked me when I was much younger. Studied Arabic in a fit of idealism when I was in college in the 05-09 period, didn't effectively use my college period partly due to personal flaws and partly due to economics (never pieced together the money to do study abroad which is a highly advisable thing to do when studying a foreign language.) Then the economic crisis happened and I had trouble getting and keeping a job for a while, and also a close family member died. I currently am stably employed and am paid better than at any of my previous jobs, but it is at a fairly boring factory job, sitting in the stockroom opening UPS deliveries, giving the stuff to the maintenance department, updating the database of what we have, and listening to my coworkers talk about how great Trump is. (I am a democrat in one of the most heavily republican counties in my state.) I like the scenery in the area where I live but don't have much of a social life and most of my college friends who I still talk to live in cities far away from me. I would love to get out of my current situation but feel like imposter syndrome will kick in whenever I try for a job I might like. 

  I ought to return to school or something but am somewhat anxious about giving up a paid job to do it, and also am torn between doing something I like and something that looks like it plausibly pays money. Technical stuff seems like it pays well these days but I am a more humanities oriented person and am inhibited from studying things like programming because I am unsure what thing I could apply it to that I would be motivated at and there's lots of competition from more interested people, but professions like 'history teacher' are also lacking in prospects and so on and so forth. My main problem here is probably actually more about anxiety forcing me into inaction, though. If I thought I had a good chance at some decent civil service job or had a flash of insight on what kinds of interesting jobs I'm not thinking of, I would love to pursue those, but I keep on having the anxiety spiral.

  The good thing about my current job is that I enjoy reading and it has great breaks (insert joke about being in a union) so I can manage to get some good reading done on the days I bring a book to work.

      I have opinions about the importance of good governance and therefore am attracted to the idea of working in some public planning field or attaching myself to some politician (in the event that I get the connections to some politician.) For practical purposes, if I move, it is likely to be to the New York City or Washington areas, since the first is where my friends are and either place is a good fit for 'what I would like to be employed doing in an ideal world'. A friend of mine urges me to go into the nonprofit field in New York City (what she does and where she does it) but it doesn't pay well. I might be interested in that if it was something on the more effective altruism end of the spectrum but generic politics is more interesting to me than generic nonprofit.
      More generically, history and linguistics are areas I have strong interests in, but the job market seems decidedly not great for those. More broadly, my personality tends me towards the 'sit at your desk researching' type jobs than the 'interact with random members of the public in PR or sales' end of the spectrum except in areas where I have strong motivation (like politics.)

      Who I would like to spend time with: my tastes run variably highbrow and mildly nerdy and many of the people I currently spend time with are more towards the god, guns, and nascar end of the spectrum. I go onto Meetup.com periodically and there are a handful of interesting local groups doing things like hiking or discussing atheism or watching non-action movies but they mostly meet at times bad for my schedule and most of the local groups are things like bible study. Lots of Ithaca NY groups seem interesting - it is close enough to me for those groups to show up on Meetup but sufficiently far away that I can't really go to any of them.

  Well... yesterday i had to write an essay as an exam. We had like 60 minutes to cover 2 A4 pages. It was as a kind o exam/test if you had understood and read the lecture( the lecture being "crime and punishment" by F.Dostoyevsky). So the question we had been asked was "Can morality change ?"

  I ofcourse answered yes and listed some examples from the book. Today i learned that the answer was supposed to be no, morality isnt something that can change. The teacher argumanted that by saying that its in the context of the book so we have to kinda use the arguments the author of the book made. Meaning that since we answered wrongly we didnt really understand the book. I get that and i know it makes atleast some sense to me but why even ask us the question if no matter our argumentation the answer will be set in stone.

  i was really bugged by this and i dont know what to think about this. Kinda mad i wont get a good grade since i thought my response wasnt half bad.

    In my experience with literature teachers, you can make literally any argument you damn well please, but you have to use the text to support it. You probably could have argued that morality can change, but would need to use textual evidence and explain why passages that seemed to say otherwise really didn't.

      The book and the text we had been handled were my only points of reference tho. Teacher today just told us that everyone who answered yes has it wrong and didnt understand the book. She didnt check the works yet so ...idk

  Anyone got some good ways to keep out of an anxiety spiral so I can take some MOOCs and finish getting my PhD applications in?

  Speaking of which, got the personal statements separated out by school.  I need to rewrite a couple to target computer science departments (with cognition labs) instead of neuroscience departments.  That's harder than it sounds, since a personal statement is supposed to express my personal drive to study the subject.

  Gonna have to leave my current narrative about the brain and stuff into a bunch of stuff about Moravec's Paradox, Neats vs Scruffies, "build it to understand it" and such... for an essay about studying the core affect/evaluative system.

  Oh shit, I need to throw in the citations in all of them.

    there's a wealth of literature on the beneficial effects of exercise w.r.t. reducing anxiety (most of it focused on aerobic exercise, but some also on e.g. strength training), and some on exposure to nature-y/outdoors-y stuff, so I suggest going on a medium-length (~10mi? idk, w/e is appropriate for your current level of fitness and time availability) run in some nearby park/trail system 

    > a personal statement is supposed to express my personal drive to study the subject.

    express *and* evince! Be sure to not just wax poetic on your love of neural nets \*or\* whatever, but provide concrete examples of your consistent interest and competence in them (ideally in ways that aren't immediately obvious from the rest of your app/cv). Overall though I don't think a personal statement is too make-or-break-y, but maybe it's different in neuro/cs departments. Also, by citations, do you mean more ~5 or, like, 50? In my experience personal statements aren't supposed to be research statements so be sure yours isn't as much of one!

    You could also consider marketing yourself more as an interdisciplinarian and then not have to change too much!

    (and regardless should imo seek to integrate yourself into multiple groups to allow for greater flexibility on future job markets -- put on your neuro hat when applying to neuro jobs, your cs hat when applying to cs jobs, etc.)


    Good luck!

      Well, I'm not exactly trying to study neural nets... and I can't really show competence in the thing I *am* signing up to study, because it's fairly unique to these few labs.  And new.

      So I'm settling for showing consistent wide-ranging interest in the subject, and hopefully making as nice a picture of my quantitative background (I have one, just not in neurosci) as possible.  This will definitely show interest that isn't just apparent from my CV.

      But yeah, I think for the computing departments, I can pitch myself as an interdisciplinarian looking to build out computational models of the stuff being discovered in neurosci and cogsci, which also lets me work on the neurosci/cogsci side in mostly the same labs, while also having the excuse *not* to wave my hands about how the calculations happen when writing papers.

      >Overall though I don't think a personal statement is too make-or-break-y, but maybe it's different in neuro/cs departments.

      I mean, it's still got to be *good* when you're trying to change from one field to another, especially when the new field is... well, was only really *born* in the past decade or so, so it's not like you can have a publication in it already.

      Gosh, that's a surprisingly positive way to think of my chances.  My tutor *did* mention that only 5% of admits to my top target department *actually* had any kind of publication going in, and that they really like to admit from quantitative backgrounds for their neuro/cog programs rather than just biological backgrounds.

      >Also, by citations, do you mean more ~5 or, like, 50?

      More like five.  I just started looking it over, and I've really had to throw out most of the actual non-personal neurosci stuff from this statement.

      >(and regardless should imo seek to integrate yourself into multiple groups to allow for greater flexibility on future job markets -- put on your neuro hat when applying to neuro jobs, your cs hat when applying to cs jobs, etc.)

      Most of the labs I'm applying to are interdisciplinary cognition labs: combinations of comp-sci/cog-sci/psych/neuro/linguistics.  My real needle to thread is getting the space/excuse to implement some computational stuff based on theoretical neuroscience, while also getting the neurosci-side excuse to turn the computational stuff towards problems related to actual, embodied minds.

In addition to PhD applications, the point of the MOOCs is really to set myself up to be able to do academic things that way: just put in the work, and get the results.  I was never able to treat school like that before, and I've been having to re-learn how to study to do it.

  I have been in a reflective move about my age recently, and I realized that in a period of let's say 1-4 years I am going to become an adult. I further realized that I have no idea what that entails besides the obvious changes in my legal status and the associated societal expectations. Given that this is a sub whose members are probably much more similar to me than average, I have a rather stereotypical set of questions to ask you all: What ought I prepare for? What ought I do now?

      To finally destroy any illusion of anonymity I might have, I am 16.

      In terms of future plans, I want to do something about the long list of horrible problems the world has, especially problems in how people think or fail to. In terms of interests, math, computers, etc., as you might expect.

      I have not changed much over the years in qualitative ways, unlike most people I know. Any advice on how to change for the better?

          Small risk of that. Fortunately for future-me, I have a healthy understanding of what that would mean for my job prospects

              I told the school counselor at 12, in response to a vague question about what I wanted to achieve in life, my brilliant plan of discovering room-temperature superconductivity, repaving every road in America with said material, and building cars so energy efficient as a result of lower friction that they could be powered by solar panels alone. This impressed her so much that I decided to really plan it all out. Then I realized that I had no idea that I was going to discover room-temperature superconductivity, let alone get funding for I was quickly discovering would be an insanely expensive and unpopular infrastructure proposal. That day marks one of perhaps four shifts in maturity that I have actually noticed.

              All the yes to this, to the extent that it is not obviously horrible, and they should also use those tests to determine credit requirements. I know someone with an insane capacity to memorize historical material and correlate it into models. The person in question may also literally fail too many math courses to graduate high school. Clearly there is something wrong here, when people's grades can be that stark.

          I did competitive math for a year, before my life took one of its more exciting turns, but I am likely to get back into it this year, if for no other reason than that I would make the 4th member of the school's team. In terms of math knowledge, I am taking BC Calc (basically Calc 1.5) this year and know a good deal of popular mathematics. My expertise is basically, "has read two decision theory papers, does physics homework sans calculator."

          In terms of computers, this is a very recent interest on my part, although I do program for my school's robotics team. I have no idea what to actually do to meaningfully progress past the, "Quick study; knows some Java and C++" stage.

            Right, but even that amount of interest and activity can be something you leverage into bigger things. For example, SPARC and ESPR are summer camps run by many of the same people as the Center for Applied Rationality that high school students can apply for. You might find it the kind of thing that helps you change in qualitative ways :)

        If you want to make a large impact on the world's horrible problems, your three main routes are startups, politics, and academia. Pretty much all of those require a bachelors to be taken seriously, so college is basically a must. The following advice is largely USA-centric. Try to get into a state school, ideally with enough scholarships to cover at least tuition + room and board. Landing a national merit scholarship via PSAT score will help hugely with that, they can easily be 20k+, and usually qualify you for other school specific merit aid. I'm of the opinion that the Ivy's and small private schools aren't really worth it and that if you're good about finding research opportunities, you can learn and do far more at a large state research school.

        From there, consider college as the time to lay groundwork for your future plans. While you will be academically busy with classes, you will have a relatively open schedule and access to a ton of technology. I'd recommend getting involved with a lab that takes undergraduates, but there are no shortage of other things you could be doing. Have fun, learn things, spend at least one summer doing some sort of actual work related to your field, and make friends. Also, obligatory plug for Texas A&M University, as I am an Aggie (Class of 2016!). Also we do cool shit with robots.

          > I'm of the opinion that the Ivy's and small private schools

          I don't think these should be discounted entirely, especially if you don't come from a middle class background, since they give pretty fantastic need-based aid than can often (partially) stack with merit-based (and if you're upper class it might well be your parents can pay out-of-pocket). Plenty of them have solid departments for research, too. I went to a small-ish private university primarily b/c they agreed to cover my costs and then some -- I think my living stipend after tuition and fees were paid was something like ~$15k-$20k per year, which was more than enough for food and housing, a comfortable travel/adventure budget, and a nice kickstart to investments in a (then) future runway + emergency fund.

          (I do second the PSAT point -- I think around $5k/year of the money I received came from that national merit thing, and some of the schools I applied to gave considerably more)

    If I could send a message to my 16-year old self that he would take seriously I would say the following:


    1. develop smart study strategies since simply relying on natural smarts will eventually come to bite you in the ass-- I recommend looking into Cal Newport's books, getting good at using a Spaced Repetition program like [Anki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anki/), and generally becoming more comfortable with working hard on stuff. If you're puzzled about what to learn, try the Ultimate Geography [deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2109889812). Do 5 new cards a day and you'll learn every country's flag/capital/map_image within a year-- makes international relations/news/politics surprisingly understandable when you understand the geographic relationships between places. 

    2. get more physically fit/aesthetic, for the aesthetic/social benefits if nothing else. Yes, it's shallow, but if you go from unathletic skinny or fat male physique to even kind-of in shape ('swimmer's body'), you'll be quite happy with the change. 

    3. realize that social status (popularity) is  usually something you have to work for, not something some people just naturally have. Status games/hierarchies vary widely depending on context but in nearly every social circle I've encountered, the combination of confidence, calibration (something vaguely like social intelligence or skill at reading the room or body language skills) and being good at something will reap dividends. If you're like most people, no matter what you try to convince yourself of, your place in the social hierarchy will play a big role in how happy you are. Learning to play the social game early on will be helpful for basically every other endeavor, though some professions (STEM academia, tech sector) will have other ways of raising your status, like being really good at what you do.


    4. for #3, there isn't any single resource out there that's comprehensive. The classic advice of "How to Win Friends and Influence People" is not bad, but the book is a little too vanilla and bland to be super useful. "Models" by Mark Manson is a good book too, though not all that actionable. For me the combination of meditation and social immersion was key, along with befriending more socially skilled friends. I went from mild/moderate social anxiety to basically socially fearless over ~5 years-- it was an effortful transition, but well-worth it.

    5. Ala Gwern's [piece](https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society) on subcultures, never forget that if the social circle you're currently in is toxic or causing you lots of unhappiness, you can always opt out and choose one you're more suited or interested in. Of course, don't let the low cost of switching deter you from eventually learning the important skills of socializing and hierarchy navigation.


    Above all, I'd say the following:

    -whenever you feel particularly emotionally shitty, try your hardest to take the outside view-- most things are temporary, this too shall pass, and in a week or a month or a year, whatever has you so down will probably be nothing more than a faint memory with little emotional impact. Remember that when things get overwhelming!
    ```

    ```
    > What ought I prepare for?

    Getting mostly pretty fucked-over by society, and having to figure out how to live and help your friends and family despite that.

    Also, should you want to be materially secure, some form of remunerative career.  Also, should you have some cause or plan you care about, how to execute on that.

    >What ought I do now?

    Ace everything in high school, or somehow manage to take uni-level classes in high school and ace them.  Get some work experience too.

    When I was young, I knew that my time of ever having any free time or leisure was counting down, so I wanted to take advantage of it.  That was a bad decision.

    When you're young, you have almost no real choices in life, so each one where you do the "responsible" thing and constrict your options to a bunch of hard work and stuff feels like utter shit.  Problem is, the returns on those Responsible Things compound into adulthood, eventually giving you a lot more choices as an adult.  You're sacrificing choices as a youth to have more later on.

    Shit sucks, but it's an investment.

    >What should I know?

    If you get the sense that the world is coming to an end, you're entirely correct.  Please help the rest of us handle this.

    Adulthood is difficult and draining, and that's why the adults around you seem so damn drained.

    Solidarity and love for others are essentially all we fucking have right now, and that's a *really bad* situation to be in, actually.

    You are going to die, and you may experience real personal suffering at any time.

    Civilizational crisis and climate apocalypse aside, almost everyone you meet has more potential than they're getting to really express.  Help with that.  If you ever wanted to be a hero, now's the time.

    When I think of snakes, I am invariably reminded of Ancient Egypt, and there are some cool two syllable Egyptian names like Djoser, Neheb, and of course Apep. That being said, corn snakes are not Egyptian and given your reference points are Morty and Noodle you are not looking for anything exotic.

    For maximum snake irony, there is always Adam (Eve is monosyllabic of course). Alex is popular, genderless, and inoffensive, with a pleasing sound. I find Mary, David, Richard, Harry, and Hanna to have nonzero personality without being Chad, or similar. The suite of angel names, Michael, Raphael, URIEL, etc., convey tiny amounts of mysticism without being Hastur, although some are longer than you specify.

    There's always [Ouroboros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros) (Ouro for short) the metaphorical snake that eats its own tail, symbolising eternity (especially a cyclical eternity). Pronunciation varies, so I'd just go with "Oo-row" for the short form.

    Other possibilities:

    * Rook or Brook
    * Muon or Gluon
    * Fuse (you can joke that it was short for "Refuses to eat")
    * Bluey (only if the snake is definitely *not* blue, preferably red instead; this is an Australian style of nickname that may not translate)
    * Cue ball (if white)
    * Oolong (a type of tea, often [this sort of colour](https://www.organicfacts.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Oolongtea1.jpg))

    None of those are particularly similar to "Rudolph" though.

    Ugh. This review is sneering so hard that it comes across as the author having an axe to grind, which would be tolerable on its own if they actually made good criticisms, but instead within a few paragraphs they get many parts of the plot or themes of the story blatantly wrong or show that they massively missed the point of it.

    Criticisms of the actual science would be useful if I could trust the author to know what he's talking about. Having found out that he's been using alt accounts to lie about his experiences and credentials in argument threads massively lowers my confidence in anything he says being worth following up on beyond the amount I normally do for new ideas I encounter.
