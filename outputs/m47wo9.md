## [D] Saturday Munchkinry Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Saturday Munchkinry and Problem Solving Thread! This thread is designed to be a place for us to abuse fictional powers and to solve fictional puzzles. Feel free to bounce ideas off each other and to let out your inner evil mastermind! 

Guidelines:

* Ideally any power to be munchkined should have *consistent* and *clearly defined* rules. It may be original or may be from an already realised story.
* The power to be munchkined can not be something "broken" like omniscience or absolute control over every living human.
* Reverse Munchkin scenarios: we find ways to beat someone or something  *powerful*.
* We solve problems posed by other users. Use all your intelligence and creativity, and expect other users to do the same.

Note: All top level comments must be problems to solve and/or powers to munchkin/reverse munchkin.

Good Luck and Have Fun!

  You are a magical girl. You have a pool of power which you can draw from to evoke various effects. This pool has no maximum amount, but does not replenish on its own; the only way to gain more power is by killing another magical girl and absorbing theirs or by defeating scary monsters.

  The main powers of a magical girl are transformation, conjuration, manipulation, and enhancement. All of these are limited by the girl’s domain, which is some class of manmade things. The domain also modifies the base power costs of various effects, making some more or less efficient. Your domain is **cleaning supplies.**

  **Transformation**:

  * All magical girls have the ability to transform, replacing their body with a facsimile, and detransform, reversing the process. Transformation costs only a token amount of power, and detransformation is costless. Staying transformed imposes an ongoing power cost; an hour transformed would cost a moderate amount of power. The transformed body appears similar to the original apart from its costume and sometimes minor cosmetic differences such as strange eyes or hair. All powers are more potent and efficient in this form. A transformed body performs slightly beyond the peak of what is humanly possible in most respects, apart from strength, which is massively enhanced. It is not much more durable than a peak human body, but it is much more robust, like a Hollywood zombie. This form does not retain damage or alteration between transformations; a magical girl who loses an arm, detransforms, and then transforms will be good as new.

  * Detransformation is instantaneous, while transformation initially takes a few seconds, though the time can be reduced with practice. You are able to transform in half a second, and your costume is a maid outfit with perpetually sudsy hems.

  * Like all powers, transformation and detransformation can be invoked at will, but this will can be involuntary. Magical girls who experience sufficient pain or shock will reflexively detransform. This reflex can be trained out to an extent with practice. You can grit your teeth and maintain your form through anything less painful than dismemberment.

  **Conjuration**:

  * All magical girls have the ability to conjure items from their domain. Power cost scales with distance, mass, volume, and material displaced; displacing anything denser than air is very costly. Cost also grows exponentially with a new conjuration’s proximity to another magical girl relative to its proximity to yourself. There is a moderate ongoing cost to maintaining conjurations as well which is based on only mass and volume. Dismissing conjurations is costless.

  * You can conjure all sorts of cleanings supplies: brooms, trash picks, dustpans, cleaning agents of all kinds, and so on. Magical girls differ in the strictness of their domains; unfortunately, you can only create things which actually exist or have existed. You could attempt to game this by making novel cleaning supplies yourself, but your magic is unlikely to recognize their legitimacy unless you manage to get them widely used (even though it is perfectly happy to let you conjure replicas of singleton items that were created without your influence.)

  **Manipulation**:

  * All magical girls can manipulate items within their domain in various ways, most commonly telekinetically. You can exert forces on cleaning supplies. Power cost seems to scale with magnitude of acceleration in addition to magnitude of force, such that you can have brooms sweep at low cost but accelerating a tiny mass to ballistic velocities would be a great expenditure.

  **Enhancement**:

  * All magical girls have some ability to enhance certain properties of items within their domain. You have a vague ability to eliminate contaminants and germs from cleaning supplies. You could use this to mop up blood and continuously delete the blood soaked up by the mop, for example. This has a very low power cost.

  **Special**:

  * Most magical girls have one or more specific abilities in addition to the standard ones. 
  You and your clothes are perfectly clean at all times. Your body passively and involuntarily repels contaminants, and you never have to use the bathroom.

  How do you use these powers, particularly in combat? (You can use them for other things, but assume that you are trying to keep them secret from non magi.)

    A "cleaning products" domain is very well suited for chemical attacks. The traditional, don't-try-this-at-home, example is mixing bleach with an acidic cleaning product to form chlorine gas, but the domain of cleaning can also include industrial-strength products which can be extremely caustic or acidic, particularly when combined properly. For example, think about the chemicals that are poured into commercial pools or the stuff that's used in industrial applications to clean machinery--it can get extremely nasty to the point where you need to wear an ABC grade hazmat suit to handle the stuff. 

    Even better, if the gas formed by mixing cleaning products still counts as "in the domain", applying telekinesis to it would be an extremely effective attack against anything that needs to breathe and is also well suited for assassination (and to prevent killing yourself in a gas attack obviously). Specifically, you can whip up an odorless gas that's so deadly that only people who've been trained to recognize hypoxia, have quick reflexes, and have an o2 mask within arm's reach would survive.

      Correct. [Have some art as a reward.](https://imgur.com/a/GizvdSM)
      I'm particularly interested in the specifics of what chemical weaponry is possible and how to make explosives or extremely combustible conjurations.

  - u/dinoseen:
    ```
    One thing I haven't seen in the replies is the use of pressure cleaners. Shooting out a jet of water with that much power is already enough to cause serious injury, with enhancement you might just have yourself a functional gun.
    ```

  - u/RetardedWabbit:
    ```
    As others have pointed out you're functionally the chemical weapon domain, but people don't realize how far this can go. Household chemicals are cute, but they don't hold a candle to industrial hygiene and cleaners. Probably the nastiest cleaners for us would be those used for oil. They use chemicals that are nightmarishly toxic even aside from their real function: to break down the highly resistant organic sludges left over from everything. You're made of much less resistant organics than the things those cleaners eat through.

    Depending on the powers definition of "widely used" these could also be very cheap. Is it widely used by person popularity, by tons a year, or by societal impact?

    Another area for exploitation is your immunity to contaminants, with a bit of "manual" work you can also be the bioweapon magical girl.

    Conjuration in proximity to other magic girls has an easy work around also: just carry your chemicals. Put "safer" ones in whatever works, and get ampules of the more dangerous ones. Bad accidents wouldn't be dangerous to you, and you can probably mitigate them with your power.

    Also you can survive off of rotten/diseased/poisonous food and water. And act as a limited intake black hole for water.

    I'm not sure how scary the scary monsters are, but my first thought is that while on a surface level you may appear to be Magical Girl Cleaning Supplies, in reality you could be considered as Magical Girl Chemical Weaponry. To give an example, think of how many human-hostile chemicals are used in laboratories to clean equipment. Even with more mundane supplies (though take this with a grain of salt, given my lack of explicit knowledge) you could cause some pretty nasty chemical reactions to occur. Especially given one notable hole in the limits on conjuration - what stops me summoning something really quite dangerous *juuuuust* above someone's skin? Or, alternatively, once the rival magical girl begins their monologue, from summoning just a little bit of something poisonous inside their open mouth?

    There's also something to consider regarding what counts as 'influence' when it comes to replicas of singleton cleaning items. Could I ask a friend to ask a friend to ask a friend to clean up their house using a broom that also works a firearm? What if the last person in the chain had no idea why the previous friend wanted it? Would that still be influence? Because if you game the system to summon almost anything, that could be big.

    I don't know how I would research this, but I would be legitimately surprised if some combination of cleaning equipment couldn't combine explosively.

    I'm also thinking of radiation, since that's occasionally used to sterilise medical equipment and such. Perhaps you could conjure the radiation itself? Seems potentially useful for ambush, especially since each individually chunk of radiation conjured wouldn't need to be maintained for very long.

    You could conjure 'ropes' of steel wool, perhaps, to tangle and restrain foes. Even if someone could have the strength to break through, they might get bogged down by it. Similar to dangerous chemicals, you could also just conjure it very close to sensitive areas like the eyes and face. Enhance the scrubbing ability of the wool and oof, ouch, owie.

    Speaking of enhancement, a great deal of cleaning equipment works by killing unwanted organisms. Bug spray or rat poison might be considered an aspect of this, if your power is feeling generous. What if you were to enhance the toxicity of these substances? That could be very effective at causing... accidents.

    Oh, and clothes perfectly clean at all times? Sounds like they'd make decent bandages. If not for you, then for other people. Cleaning wounds is a form of cleaning, so that's also enhanced.

    Alcohol is a pretty common cleaning supply. It's also present in a lot of drinks. Would be a shame if an enemy magical girl didn't know their limits when you 'enhance' the cleaning powers of the alcohol in their drink.

    Last thing I can think of that might be useful for combat at the moment (and this is a stretch) is that some cleaning supplies might have been... made out of humans. Or monsters, if a company gets on that! So while I understand that there's probably a hidden limit here, is there anything stopping you from manipulating the relevant human parts?

    Hope this helped!

      No, this is exactly what I was saying is not possible. In what world is getting someone to do something not influence just because they don't know the reason why? The powers are very intelligent.

    If you had the completely unrestricted ability to create *any* substance that has ever been made, from carbon nanotubes to iridium alloys to white phosphorus to botulinum toxin, probably the most reliable go-to for general purpose ludicrous overkill in direct combat would probably be Chlorine trifluoride. It's already been used in several ratfics, my favorite appearance being Dungeon Keeper Ami, where it taught gods what it's like to feel very small and very terrified.

    This chemical is actually produced and used regularly IRL, for one single application: to *clean* chemical vapour deposition chambers.

    >  the only way to gain more power is by killing another magical girl and absorbing theirs or by defeating scary monsters.

    Are there slime/ooze/dirt monsters? They seem in-genre, and weak to cleaning supplies. So you could grind for power by seeking them out and mopping them up. Same applies to bug monsters if pesticides count as cleaners (even if they don't, I assume bleach kills insects).
    ```

  - u/gramineous:
    ```
    Different point from the cleaning-specific munchkining, but the notes on transformation speed and consumption rate on transformation versus while transformed means you could have more efficient power usage by improving your speed here. Grab something long and sharp or with a weight on the end and transform when you swing, put some distance between the two of you, and then untransform until approached or until your next attack if the enemy needs to approach you (or is a mindless monster). The chemicals other people mentioned will have their damage ramp up over time, so attacking, then jumping backwards and untransforming while your enemy writhes in pain could work.

    Probably want to work out how outfit transformation rules work, since being able to hide it all across transformations under a large trenchcoat would help with being stealthy, or at least not immediately recognised when you attack.

    You mention conjuration gets harder with proximity to another magical girl being greater than to yourself, could you still pull your am back while holding a knife, coat or modify the blade, then lunge forward to stab? The knife is just a simple example, here rather than only application of tempprarily keeping something close to you before launching or moving it somehow.

    Also, I assume conjured items last past the detransformation? This would be important to know where hazmat suits and not wasting power staying transformed is concerned.

    Oh, and you mention transforming/detransforming/transforming returning you to functional health, can others use it to "scrub" off any chemicals? Can you use it yourself to make excess flesh/blood/ even limbs, since your shtick is chemicals anyway being able to have some additional resources on hand couldn't hurt? Even outside of that being your thing, faking severe injuries with a puddle of blood you quickly replace via transformation could work to turn the tables on someone.

    Edit: oh, does detransforming and retransforming restore stamina and how rested you feel? Being able to find space in a fight for less than a second to be back to top shape seems abusable.

    For more mundane use, I'd probably start an incredibe maid service. I'm the best maid basically ever, and as long as I am not too quick I can finish faster than anyone without drawing suspicion. Furthermore, while I don't really know enough about this type of stuff, don't people messing around with bacteria and viruses and other similar stuff need incredibly sterilized environments? I'd be good for that as well.

    Speaking of sterilization, could I clean wounds well? That'd be helpful for when I or others become injured. I could conjure a broom and use it as a splint or crutch in emergency situations. 

    Since I can manipulate cleaning supplies, and chemical agents have been mentioned, I could do some pretty nasty stuff via attacking with some of the stronger stuff, especially if I manage to get/have incredibly fine control over the supplies. Less quantity means less power expended, and with fine control I can do more with less so.

  A SCP inspired munchkinry... (inspired by [TABOO](http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo)).

  You can swap the names of “things” (people, places, and things) in your line of sight.  Once the name is swapped, then for information processing purposes, the conceptual identifiers of those things are swapped.  Identifying sub-portions of the swapped things still work, but looking at the the things as a whole results in the swapped identification.

  * For a simple example I name a Red Delicious Apple “Apple_1” and the soft blue pillow I use in my bed as “scruiser’s pillow”.  I then swap their names.  People would now see the pillow as Red Delicious Apple and the apple as a soft blue pillow.  Breaking things down or looking at sub parts can penetrate the swapping effect, for instance looking at a tiny portion of the apple people could correctly identify it as red or feeling they shape of the apple in the dark they could identify it as apple shaped, but seeing too much information and they will go back to seeing the apple as a pillow.

  Other quirks:

  * Users of this power can overcome the effect with enough analysis, introspective thought, experimentation, or by seeing the process as it happens.

  * Users of this power can quickly name things that lack Proper noun names with a few minutes concentration (for instance naming a pillow or an apple).  Non-users need to regularly use that name both in their head and out loud for a few hours to a few days to make it count as a name.

  * Renaming things can partially or completely undo this power’s effects.  A non-user of this power could repeatedly refer to the blue pillow as the inedible-apple until that sticks as a name, and this name would have more correct conceptual identifiers (soft, blue, non-edible) with maybe one or two incorrect ones stuck on it (thinking of the pillow as apple-shaped even when it isn’t).

  * people tend to rationalize the inconsistencies... if you swapped a person’s name with a tree’s name other people might reason that the tree is a person standing very still and that the person is mobile and sapient tree while the person with a tree name might rationalize that they are a tree that recently gained sentience and human motor skills, and with repeated renamings might eventually recognize that they are actually person shaped and sized.

  * You can spread this power to other people by swapping their names and letting them struggle with an epistemic breakdown.  If the manage not to go completely insane or accidentally kill themselves or get killed they develop the name swapping power after a few weeks (typically renaming themselves in the process). 

  Munchkin Challenges:

  A Fey Creature operating under the names of “a clever scholar” and Dr. Japers is loose in the world.

  * What things can this Being of Faerie do to maximize harm and/or maximize the chance of breaking the secrecy of magic?  What things might this Fey Being do to make money and keep a low profile?

  * Conversely how might you catch the Clever Fey Scholar as member of a magic secrecy preserving organization with the full might of the US government behind you (but little magic yourself).

  * how might you use this power as a person who has just gained it and become aware of said Fey Entity and a sketchy secret organization?

  - u/ArmokGoB:
    ```
    What happens if you swap "The Economy" with "The Moon"?
    What about swapping "The Bible" with "The Lesswrong Sequences"?

    In general, I think the thing to do here is swap things that are very large and very public, that people care a lot about, to cause global shifts in incentives and policy.
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      It needs to be specific material things you can see.  A particular Bible and a particular printout of the Lesswrong Sequences could be name-swapped, but not all Bibles with the Sequences as a whole.  Likewise the Economy as a whole lacks a physical material existence to be seen and swapped with.

      Still swapping a prized family Bible that someone used frequently with the Sequences printout would probably work for the purposes of brainwashing them into a Rationalist.  They wouldn’t forget parts of the Bible they already memorized from other editions of the Bible, but unless they memorized the entire Bible they would rationalize the Sequences as parts of the Bible they missed or overlooked or forgot about.

      The Moon would work... if you swapped it with a location, everyone would be convinced that location had no atmosphere and was unreachable without spaceships.  Big Locations work kind of weird... if you swapped a house or a neighborhood people would believe that the Moon’s properties applied to it, but if you swapped the Moon with an entire city, people might be able to rationalize how individual subportions/buildings/neighborhoods/streets have breathable air despite the city of Moon as whole being a barren airless isolated environment.

      Yeah, there definitely needs to be some difficulty modifier to prevent things like this if you want it to be balanced.

        It’s not intended to be balanced... of the Clever Faerie Scholar wanted, they could [probably cripple if not outright destroy civilization](http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5404) (not the same power I outlined, but indicative of the power level we are talking about here).

        Finding a constructive usage is much harder... given how wacky and mind twisting this power is, I wonder if any even exists.

        - u/dinoseen:
          ```
          You could always use it to acquire ordinary power and put that to altruistic uses. It seems like it would be relatively easily to swap people's identities, meaning you could replace billionaires and politicians with more ethical stand-ins.

  Meant to post this on Sat but got too busy, hoping it gets some interest. If not there's always next week. The scenario is ripped from Stephen King's *Under The Dome*, which I highly recommend as a pseudo-rational and very good novel. Minor spoilers follow, but scenario #3 is fully made up and does not constitute one. 

  A 50km radius sphere, centered on a small town in rural Maine, becomes encapsulated by a transparent dome of force. The dome is impermeable to anything larger than a water molecule, and is 1% as permeable to smaller particles as normal air. Light travels normally through the dome, and sound is a bit muffled but perfectly audible. The dome is a fully immovable object--there is no amount of force that can damage, deform, or otherwise alter its perfectly spherical shape. It has as much friction as standard window glass. 

  A few scenarios for munchkinry:

  1. You are the mayor of the small town trapped inside the dome. Unlike the tyrannical character who ends up in charge in the novel, you are an upstanding and rational civil servant with the best interests of your constituents at heart. With no indication that the dome will ever come down, how do you go about shepherding resources and realigning the town's society and economy to last for as long as possible cut off from all outside resources? (Hint: you'll want to seriously cut down on any kind of particulate emissions, since they can't escape and will accumulate.) Also consider how you would set up a dome-washing process, as otherwise dust, dirt and smoke will adhere to the inside surface and eventually blot out the sun. 

  2. You are the CEO of an advanced technology R&D corporation with deep ties to world governments and commensurately deep pockets, as well as a team of the world's best scientists and engineers at your disposal. How do you exploit the physics-defying nature of the dome to advance Earth science? Bonus points for doing this in a way that preserves (or, better, helps) the poor residents of Domesville.

  3. You are an aspiring supervillain whose latest scheme went better than you could possibly have imagined. You now have the ability to create one invulnerable 50km sphere at a time, given six months of complex calculations and one goat sacrifice. How do you use your newfound power to achieve world domination, with the understanding that if you become Public Enemy #1 as soon as anyone finds out you're responsible for the dome? Domes you create are anchored to the Earth's frame of reference, and their rules apply to you the same as any other matter.
  ```

  - u/Freevoulous:
    ```
    >You are the mayor of the small town trapped inside the dome

    First would be gathering the representatives of each household in one building to set up some rules and prevent panic. The only people exempt from this eetign are emergency services (especially firefighters, even amateur ones, since a fire under the dome means doom).  


    1. First of all, we assume strict water rationing and recycling / filtering, as best we can. Even though the dome allows rain in and ground water out, most of it is not drinkable.
    2. Strict fire control: use of open fires will be limited to communal kitchens, and any use of fire outside of it must be first reported and consulted with t he Emergency Services.
    3. Rationing of food. All foods not currently in people's households are reclaimed and rationed by the Town Council, and the citizens are also encouraged to go on a minimal diet and share with their neoghbours.
    4. Immediately put work and resources into turning all available land into farmland, plus hydroponics, aquaponics, and vertical gardening. Every seed of every edible plant is re-seeded. The Town Square becomes an agricultural R&D and a market to share info and resources.
    5. We collect all the ammo and explosives we have, and try to blow up a hole in the dome. It fails, but accomplishes two objectives: make people realize that the dome is for real and will remain here for foreseeable future, and also it wastes all the ammo making future riots far less bloody.  

    6. Have my best nerds work on generation or own power, and recycling/fixing everything we own, since trade with the outside is impossible.  

    7. Order a construction of a hot air balloon. The ballooners will use pressure washers to clean the dome, so it wont become grimy and opaque.

  You can touch an inanimate object smaller than 2 cubic meters and send it backwards or forwards in time, arriving in the same location it is currently in at a time of your choice.  If you send it backwards in time, only the immediate effects propagate forwards- for example, if you send an anvil back in time and crush someone one their way to deliver a check, they will be dead in the future, but the check will still have been deposited, and the bank workers will still remember them being there.  This also means you cannot use this to win the lottery, as past you will not act on any information you send.  You can move an object an unlimited amount of time into the future, but only between 3 minutes and 36 hours into the past.

    Hmmm. Talking about winning the lottery... let's say I go to buy a ticket. I ask the ticket seller to select the numbers on my piece of paper. Then, after the draw, I send a piece of paper to the past with the winning numbers on it. *My* actions do not change as a result of information sent from Future Me... I presume that doesn't work?

    Hmmmmm.

    If I'm on a moving train, and I send an object - say, a mirror - back in time ten minutes, does it end up on the train or does it fall to the train tracks where the train is now (but wasn't ten minutes ago)?

    --------------

    Let's say I am running a computer program that calculates X, unless I hit the Enter key, in which case it instead calculates Y. Both calculations are extremely intensive, taking half an hour each. If I see the result of X, write it down, then send a small weight to fall on the Enter key half an hour ago, will I see the result of calculation Y on the screen instantly?
