  ```
  Widdle Masego is so adorable.
  ```

- u/JdubCT:
  ```
  So no one else is terrified that our primary Magus has been collectively raised by genre-savvy monsters *sarcastically*? I feel like this explains a lot.
  ```

    ```
    "What are you talking about?  I was told that one should always speak and dress casually when visiting nobility, Uncle Amadeus says they are constantly surrounded by people being formal and polite so this is a nice change of pace for them.  I'm not doing the spitting though."
    ```

- u/CouteauBleu:
  ```
  Given what we know of Masego, leading him on with lady Ubua's name seems a tad cruel.
  ```

  - u/thebluegecko:
    ```
    I agree, but this is team evil raising the next great evil wizard. I suppose Masego is lucky they are such a oddly kind group of evil villains.
    ```

- u/Ardvarkeating101:
  ```
  Wait, so who was that guy at the end?  I'm assuming a high lord of something?  Or maybe Assassin?

  Also: henceforth she shall be called Lady Ubua!
  ```

  - u/Zephyr1011:
    ```
    I like the suggestion by one of the commenters that it's the high lord hosting the party. It both makes sense that he'd be important enough to be the one to talk to Warlock afterwards, and that Black would find it funny when Masego snubs him.
    ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    I figured it was Akua's father, but your reading seems to fit better. Sounds like a nice man.
    ```

    - u/Ardvarkeating101:
      ```
      I don't think BK would be laughing for Masego not knowing who *he* is
      ```

    - u/None:
      ```
      Probably the host of the party.
      ```

- u/over_who:
  ```
  This is possibly the most horrifying chapter in the entire Guide.
  ```

  - u/Yes_This_Is_God:
    ```
    Why's that?
    ```
