## [D]Has anyone done a rational!Beastars? How would you treat it?

### Post:


So I watched (and read a bit of the Manga) of Beastars, and I think it would do well with a Rational fanfic treatment.  The main premise is 'in a civilized, modern world full of anthropomorphic animals, how do individuals and society cope with the instinct toward predation?'  And it follows Legosi, a teenage wolf coping with his experiences and struggles in that domain.

The thing is... Legosi is acting like a realistic teenager. IE, pretty much a moron when it comes to interacting socially with others.  And the society, being a bit of an obvious critique at historic (and current) taboos toward interracial marriage, isn't much better.

So the thought occurs to me -- how would or should both society and individuals deal with people who sometimes have instincts to flip out and murder others, in a way that's more elegant than seems to be going on in the canon of the series? Or, if individuals within a society that isn't handling it that well want to

interact romantically in predator/prey relationships where there's high risk for violence unwanted by both parties, what are some sane steps that they can or should take?

  Hmmm, I can't really think of a good way to ratfic Beastars in a way that would be actually meaningful. Setting is already pretty rock solid, to be honest. Legosi & Company grappling with their Inner Animals and the societal pressures surrounding him is kinda the whole point too. What problems with rational!Legosi be more equipped to deal with? Genetically modifying instincts out of people? If it's trying to effect social change, then Louis is kinda already following a very precise path towards gaining the prestige necessary. >!The Panda guy filling the market's need for actual meat by using ethically sourced hospitals and such to run his Black Market is another great example of dealing with a very thorny societal problem in the most ethical way possible.!<

  I just don't think this is a source material that is conducive to a ratfic story. You could have an interesting time brainstorming worldbuilding tidbits, such as self-training methods to smother the carnivore instinct, but making bigger changes besides "it's Legosi but he is smarter" would erode the source material too much for me.

    Well, it could be another person's story set in the same universe, grappling with similar but not identical problems.  I think the idea of "being really creative when grappling with unwanted compulsions/instincts/reflexes/etc." has a lot of fertile ground for a rationalfic.

      If you think about it, this is likely a japanese allegory for sexual harassment and rape. Where it's commonly portrayed that sometimes people "just can't help it", which is a very bad take and takes the responsibility away from the criminal.

        Isn't the point of a work on this theme, to break down what's going on inside the opaque "responsibility" node, to the conflicting forces that exist within the mind? Like people with ADHD are taught to do to the opaque concept of "willpower."

  I've only seen the anime, but...
  How the hell did their society come into place?  It would take something incredibly unlikely for a bunch of of different evolved species to integrate their societies like that, even without the fact that half of them have an instinctual desire to kill and eat the other half.
  What I'm saying is that I would want to see the epic, world-changing series of events that could lead to a story like the one portrayed in the manga where wolves and rabbits go to the same late-20th century/early-21st century high school.

    The manga talks about it only recently, and as an aside to a longer plot. >!Basically, they were two different cultures, Life Eating people and Nature Eating People. They merged together, at some point a war broke out.!<

      That still doesn't really explain anything. Within the Life Eating People society, how were non-apex predators getting along with the species that predate upon *them*? I.e., what made the snake shake hands with the mongoose?

  The thing which killed me about the setting was that modern guns exist (automatic handguns imply automatic rifles imply machine/submachine guns). It felt like it really kicked the legs out from under the "but carnivores are so much stronger" thing which is so core to the series.

  If someone ratfic'd it I think it would have to be with a reimagining of the setting.

  ```
  I've only seen the start of the anime but it struck me a strange that the prey animals don't all learn MMA or carry weapons, though perhaps it's gender commentary. I got the impression that the predators are unable of using mentally complex things so it seems one could abuse that somehow.
  ```

  - u/Gavinfoxx:
    ```
    Huge advantages in reach, mass, muscles, etc. are MASSIVE advantages in personal combat... I'd expect MMA to be less useful than you'd expect. And pepper spray and similar items (even small caliber handguns!) are less immediately useful against berserk rage....
    ```

    - u/Sonderjye:
      ```
      Certaintly but no equiptment or training at all? If not for the actual combative advantage then the dillusion of control and safety?

      I'd expect the herding instinct of many herbivores to give rise, in an uplifted herbivorous species, to a strong desire for at least one member of every family (if not more) to become a bodyguard; such that in any mixed-species setting, there's always, like, ten herbivorous bodyguards just standing watchfully at the back of the room, hands on firearms, waiting for anyone to make a move. Also, obviously, a complementary strong urge in those who aren't the bodyguards, to have those bodyguards around, and to never go anywhere without them.

  Mandatory teeth and claw filing. Pepper spray or equivalent carried by prey. Pepper flavored soap and shampoo for every prey. Tasers for preys. School classes on how to detect and determine when a predator is likely to attack, locations with highest risk, behaviors you can use to tell with high accuracy when a predator is near losing control. 

  &#x200B;

  Basically any remotely socially capable group of prey would have a big advantage over any predator ever in politics and pretty much every other situation where proper social behavior is desirable. 

  &#x200B;

  They can anger predators then accuse them of attempting an attack, bait political enemies implying they are going to attack them, use specific scents that increase the likelihood predator attacks, and infinite variations of this to the Nnth degree. Basically either predators or prey would be second class citizens,  or their society wouldn't work.

  &#x200B;

  PS. It'd be very VERY difficult to beat millions of years of evolutionary psychology to make these 2 groups safely live together. Probably impossible in a manner that even comes close to our modern ideals of equality.

    > Pepper flavored soap and shampoo for every prey.

    *Pepper*? Can carnivores mostly not eat piperine? I'd expect [denatonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denatonium).

    > use specific scents that increase the likelihood predator attacks

    Wouldn't this be an arms race? I'm assuming here that predators *want* to eat prey species, not just *need* to; and so they actually would prefer, if possible, to eat them *before* going into a berserker rage, since then they have more control over the situation and can potentially "get away with it." If that's true, then predators would be all about figuring out ways to get prey-species people to *volunteer* themselves to be eaten.

    Like, say, drugging people with chemicals that cause depression and suicidal ideation in hopes that they eventually decide life is not worth living, at which point they can jump in and offer to eat them as a means of assisted suicide.

    Or, like, creating extreme sports (think BASE jumping) with high chances of death, and heavily marketing them, while also setting up certain predators as the instructors [probably because they paid for the privilege], and making the participants sign a participation waiver with fine print that says that in a remote wilderness environment, the instructor has final say on how to dispose of their body in the event that they die in an accident and are unable to be transported home.

    Or, a more "interesting" case: I'd presume that carnivores would run all the abortion clinics.

    (Tangent: do egg-laying demihumans exist in this world? Do they sell their unfertilized eggs on the open market as a foodstuff for carnivores and obligate ovivores to eat? Would it be unusual for a snake-man to date a chicken-woman under the expectation of being able to eat her eggs?)

    -----

    I would also point out that, in reality, carnivores don't only eat herbivores. *Most* carnivorous species eat other carnivorous species! If that dynamic persists in this setting, then I'd expect carnivores to *maybe* maintain some sort of blas√© "if you can beat me, you deserve to eat me" kind of sentiment when in the company of other carnivore species‚Äîsort of like cultivators in the more cruel Xianxia stories; and it'd only be in interactions with herbivores where this dynamic would be called into question.

    Also, I haven't watched the show: do non-uplifted animals not exist in this setting (any more)? Can carnivores not, in fact, just eat the cow-cows, instead of the cow-people? Can society not just keep livestock around for carnivores to preferentially attack in case of a sudden rage (much like one would imagine a werewolf would)?

      Not watched the show, but read the manga-

      >do egg-laying demihumans exist in this world?

      Yes, and they sell unfertilised eggs on the open market.  There's a side chapter from the point of view of a hen who does this, and takes pride in producing high-quality eggs for people to eat.  This is considered fine and non-taboo; however, at one point an egg is found to have somehow been fertilized and there's a stillborn/(premature?) chicken, i.e. child inside.  The group of carnivores who are eating lunch at that moment have to deal with this, with some of them wanting to treat it as a rare opportunity to eat real, live meat and some of them (protagonist) horrified because of his social upbringing.

      >do non-uplifted animals not exist in this setting (any more)?

      No.  The only non-sapient animals are insects, which are legal to eat, no smarter than real-life insects, and mulched for meat substitutes.  (Though the main character does, eventually empaphize with even them in a way somewhat analogous to real-life vegetarianism, leading to an interesting, yet somewhat comedic scene where he ritualistically consumes a grub after fasting for a week in a manner reminiscent of ancestral tribes worshipping the spirit of the animals that fed them, metaphorically absorbing its life force.  He's later visited, in a dream, by the spirit of the insect the grub would have become.)
