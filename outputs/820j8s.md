### Post:

Is this series still going? I finally got to the end of chapter 44 (or 30 something, depending on how you count the interludes), and there is a big dramatic cliffhanger, or possibly a bad ending. It doesn't seem to have been updated in a long time, and I'm wondering if anyone could inform me about it?

  Tk17studios appears to be putting a lot of pressure on himself to release the next chapter soon. I find myself more concerned for his wellbeing than for the next chapter to be released. While I doubt it would be, I hope this thread isnâ€™t taken as more external pressure on him to produce quality Content faster

    D: I hope not. 

    When I was viewing archive of our own it said last post was back in 2016, but it had also been edited a couple months ago at the end of 2017. the way the most recent chapter went i honestly didn't know if that was the end of the story or not, and this seemed like the place to ask.

  Still going, author juggles a ton of different projects at any given time, so the wait between chapters is variable.

  It is still going, author is just stalled at the moment.

      The author made an accountability post a few days ago, promising to either have the next chapter out by March 1st or donate $100 to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute. They [made good on their promise](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/7zju4c/images_onlynot_an_updatesorryranimorphs/dv2b1h4/?context=0).
