  Are you okay?
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Doing fine, thanks.  It's a joke based on the number of times people have asked me "Is this a NaruHina story?" or "Oh man, you're not doing ShinoHina, are you?  I hate ShinoHina!"
    ```

    - u/liamash3:
      ```
      ShinoHina? I'll admit, that's a pairing I just wouldn't think of in the first place. Shino seems rather...uninterested in relationships, from what I recall of him.

      Not that the author ever developed him much as a character...
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        I'm already playing awfully fast and loose with canon, so pairing him off certainly isn't outside the realm of possibility.

        Actually, the one that really gets me is that I had one person tell me "aw man i wantd [sic] anko/naruto but it looks like more naruhina shite"

        I responded with something that was as polite as I could be when saying "no well in holy hell is that ever happening."

        On its own I would have ignored it, but THE NEXT DAY I got a message from someone (who actually had good grammar) saying "I hope this isn't going to be Anko / Naruto"  I wrote back with a "Hell no, what even made you say that??!"

        The juxtaposition of the two was weird.
        ```

      - u/Saffrin-chan:
        ```
        You underestimate the Naruto fandom. Any and every possible pairing combination has been done before. Every. One.
        ```

- u/Tyvi:
  ```
  I wish you would have mentioned if the people that were being sucked dry for Naruto (oh, is he going to deal *well with* that) did so voluntarily or were forced to. Just knowing their expressions, even if they looked fanatically happy to be of use, would have made that scene even more haunting.

  EDIT: Possible reasons Orochimaru is so invested into Naruto:
  1) he wants the power of the Kyuubi and he cannot extract it to a better container/himself so he is trying to turn him

  2) he cannot afford the Kyuubi to reform for whatever reason; maybe he still has ties to Akatsuki and having to wait for it to reform would ruin their plans; in fact, if he had NO ties to them, wouldn't it make sense to kill the hosts preemptively to screw with them?

  3) he has a thing for little boys (i.e. see the Sasuke Thing from canon) and he hasn't developed Edo Tensei far enough

    There will never be pedophilia in anything I write, no exceptions. 

    I must say, I was expecting comments like "zomg, Hinata's a monster!"  Not "you know, you could have made that worse by...."

    :>
    ```

    - u/AugSphere:

      > I was expecting comments like "zomg, Hinata's a monster!"

      I think everyone mostly expects to see callous disregard for human life in rational naruto settings by now. 

      That said, it'd sure be nice if there were some repercussions Hinata actually cared about. As it looks right now, nothing of value to Hinata was lost in the incident and even her relationship with Naruto improved. I'm not sure if it's the urge to see Hinata pay for the deaths of all those people, or just the desire to see some consequence-induced character growth, but, for me, a childish tantrum leading to such a favourable outcome for the child at the expense of everyone else feels really unsatisfying.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Causation is an interesting thing.  One could make the following arguments:

        1. This is all Anko's fault, because she didn't address the issue of Hinata's abuse earlier, in a safe environment.
        1. This is all Orochimaru's fault, because he kidnapped the team and forced them to come to Sound.
        1. This is all Shino's fault because he tactlessly brought out the fact of Hinata's abuse.
        1. This is all Hinata's fault because she went out to vent her rage running instead of staying in and fighting with her teammate.  (Or, alternatively:  This is all Hinata's fault because she had a childish temper tantrum and went stomping out.)
        1. This is all Naruto's fault because he didn't stop when the Sound ninja told him to.
        1. This is all the Sound ninjas' fault, because they had Naruto trapped and they went for the kill instead of the capture.
        1. This is all Hinata's fault, because she refused to allow her teammate / friend / role model / crush to be killed.
        ```

        - u/AugSphere:
          ```
          Without a doubt there were many points at which this incident could have been averted. 

          But as far as responsibility goes, I'd say Anko is the one who's most to blame for the fiasco. Even disregarding the fact that she took a recruit with that kind of volatile emotional baggage on a mission in a foreign territory, she could have easily stopped Hinata herself instead of sending Naruto running into a hostile village. Scolding Shino was not something that absolutely had to be done immediately. So, definitely poor judgement on her part there. Not to mention the fact that she is a commanding officer and that pretty much makes everything her subordinates do her responsibility by default.

          As for Hinata, I would not say it's her fault exactly. Inability to control her actions in such a situation is understandable. The lack of maturity has to be acknowledged nonetheless. Usually I would start wondering what kind of military organisation would allow recruits to start active service without any kind of psych aptitude evaluation (especially since there is no immediate need for fresh cannon fodder on the front lines of some war), but given the political power of her father, it's no surprise she slipped through.
          ```

          - u/eaglejarl:
            ```
            Yep the whole "commanding officer" thing pretty much settles it.

            >  Even disregarding the fact that she took a recruit with that kind of volatile emotional baggage on a mission in a foreign territory

            In fairness, it was expected to be a very low-risk mission, and the whole point was to get Hinata out from under an abusive family for a while.
            ```

            - u/AugSphere:
              ```
              Infiltrating a DMZ is not something I'd think of as low-risk for someone's first mission right out of academy. I consider the decision to take this particular mission to be made under the influence of significant emotional bias. It's pretty clear by now that Anko may be a great warrior, but a great officer she is definitely not.
              ```

      - u/JackStargazer:
        ```
        > I think everyone mostly expects to see callous disregard for human life in rational naruto settings by now.

        That, and the fact that Naruto is effectively the pole around which all of her still fragile ego revolves around. I can't imagine her taking an action which consciously reduces his chance to survive, regardless of what the other consequences are.
        ```

    - u/Tyvi:
      ```
      The pedophilia thing wasn't meant seriously anyway. It's just that I like to read Naruto parodies every now and then and this is a common topic for Orochimaru. :P

      But yeah, just imagine living in a village like this until someone who you trusted or depended on knocks on your door and tells you to report to the hospital. You are not being told why but Orochimaru took in your family when it needed help the most so you go (Orochimaru strikes me as the guy who tries to have good PR; it costs him little and the gains are pretty big). 
      Then without warning you get paralyzed by one of the nurses (because in my head canon you have to be concious for the procedure because <reasons>) and get moved into the same room with that blond guy you don't know. All you know is that you are replacing the corpse that was in your place before you. And you can do nothing about but wait until your life is slowly being extinguished.

      And FWIW, what Hinata did is a pretty calculated move but not unexpected. She values Naruto more than a bunch of strangers, especially strangers she can just rationalize to belonging to an enemy faction. I imagine you will explore her feelings about this and Naruto's guilt later on (why not just add that he is creating life when he casts Kage Bunshin so he is already a murderer anyway so we can be sure his spirit is fully broken? :P).
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        > when he casts Kage Bunshin so he is already a murderer anyway 

        Yeah, in the first chapter where he used that one of the commenters here, I forget who, was loudly upset about how Naruto was a walking holocaust.

        > And FWIW, what Hinata did is a pretty calculated move but not unexpected. She values Naruto more than a bunch of strangers,

        Indeed.  I was all set to watch the sweet, sweet tears of rage and respond "You realize she's a professional murderer, right?  And has been training for it since she was 8?"  Alas, everyone is being so calm and reasonable. ;>
        ```

        - u/MadScientist14159:
          ```
          > I forget who

          That was me, and I'm still pretty outraged. I mean, *seriously*, every adult who has seen him use it? Just fucking *warn* him.

          Naruto increases this fics grimdark by at least ten points, and *no one seems to care*. Not even Anko, who's *supposed* to be looking out for him.
          ```

          - u/AugSphere:
            ```
            That's a setting in which preadolescents capable of murdering someone in cold blood are considered completely normal. It's not strange that nobody cares about the lives of clones.
            ```

            - u/MadScientist14159:
              ```
              But it's not *just* the lives of clones, it's the mental health of the *invaluable demon containing superbeing* which will be destroyed when he finds out.
              ```

              - u/AugSphere:
                ```
                Hmm. Fair point. Perhaps everyone assumes that Naruto himself will not care either. And they may actually be right, since the culture of that society is so alien to us. Perhaps for the children, who are raised to be solders, ready to be sacrificed for the convenience of their village at any point, this would not be such a big deal. 

                From the clone's and Naruto's point of view, a short life that contributes to his goals may well be preferable to no life at all. If the clones are not scared of their imminent demise, then they may actually be grateful for the chance to contribute.

          I actually just noticed nearly all of those are time travel fics, heh. I love that genre but I suppose it is well suited for parodies as well because your main cast already knows what is going to happen but just doesn't care anymore. The last link especially has a Naruto whose (sort of) insanity I really liked. :P

          EDIT: Chapter 21 of said fic is actually where I was hinting with Orochimaru and his canon pedophilia. :V
          ```

- u/krakonfour:
  ```
  I should start this series...
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    You're not going to get an objection from me...
    ```

- u/None:
  ```
  Wait, was he draining them to *death*? I got the impression he was just exhausting them to the furthest brink of unassisted recovery.
  ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    Nope. They all died. Hinata watched it happen.
    ```

    - u/JackStargazer:
      ```
      Was there really a reason for that? I mean, unless they were running on dregs in term of people to move through the process, I feel like draining another person from 100% to 1% is better than draining 99 people from 1% to 0%. 

      Especially considering that chakra naturally recovers over time. If the process went on for several hours, you could even get MORE chakra out of people if you draned to 1%, then a few hours later when they are back up to ~25% or so, drain them again to 1%.

      It's just really inefficient, even from a sociopathic perspective. 

      It's like destroying your power generators and getting new ones rather than running them out of gas and then going to refill them, even if you get a small amount more power by running it on fumes until it breaks.

      The only justification I can think of is that they were worried about not have enough people even overall to provide enough to reach the absolute borderline for Naruto's natural regen. But that decision would have had to be made early, when they couldn't possibly have known, and obviously wasn't true, and again it *still* is a dumb plan if the whole process lasts long enough for any of the first donators to recover appreciably.

      Unless they were prisoners being executed or something.
      ```

    - u/Izeinwinter:
      ```
      Seriously, what? Unless this is just the preferred method of execution or they otherwise have a reason to kill these "donors", that makes zero percent sense. Chakra regens fast. Faster than blood, even, and it isn't like there is any shortage of potential donors in the middle of a city. Just stopping at 30% remaining and yelling "next!" would be faster because they wouldn't have to spend time carting away bodies, and works out to an infinite supply because by the time they ran out of potential donors, the first donor would be have been ready to go again for ages. There is being evil, and there is being stupid. This is just both.
      ```

      - u/eaglejarl:
        ```
        Three options:

        1. Orochimaru is evil for the lulz. 
        1. I didn't think about it when I was writing it. 
        1. Something is going on. 

        Choose your preferred option. (Hint: don't choose door #2)
        ;>
        ```

        - u/Tyvi:
          ```
          So essentially 3: Make Naruto feel indebted to Orochimaru and his people because "look at how many people willingly sacrificed themselves to help you when you were directly responsible for killing two of my peacekeepers. ~~Now come, let me show my snake.~~ Don't you think you should honor them by doing <x>?"

          EDIT: While this argument is easy to refute ("Why didn't they stop before they died?") rationally, it should still have some emotional pull. Even if you know that their deaths were senseless, they still died for you. Stupid? Maybe. Easy to ignore? Probably not.

          Maybe next chapter is going to be titled 'Naruto and the 30 orphaned children' that come visit him and tell them about how heroic their parents were. You know, just for more guilt tripping. :V
          ```
