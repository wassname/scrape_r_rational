  Weeeell, shit!

  Does 'your masters' refer to the agency or to whoever gave them powers, I wonder?

  Also, I want to thank you for the constant output of this high-quality fiction. And I'm serious about that: the quality of your writing is way above average.

    Thank you! It really means a lot to hear that. HSTW is **way** outside of my comfort zone, so it's really good to hear such nice things from my readers.

    I think it's more likely to refer to the CIA, or at least PALATINATE, than whatever entity might be responsible for the powers. If I remember right the only hint that there might even be a being behind the powers is a passage in Grace's chapter*, while even a cursory look into the CIA's history reveals a lot of involvement in sketchy and unethical shit.

    I'm u/semiurge, and I approve this message

    *"as Grace pushes further it will seem as though there is something rising up all around her, pressing in on her and lurking beside her, driving her into claustrophobic paranoia." (might just be a sensory deprivation-induced hallucination)

      This is kind of awkward, considering that this is thread has been extolling my writing abilities (thank you, by the way!), but in the interest of clarifying what was apparently a poorly-written sentence, Grace is experiencing this as an effect of sensory deprivation, and there's nothing weird or plot-relevant hiding in that sentence.
      ```

        Oh lol, I figured it was supposed to be ambigyou-us. Still supports my hypothesis of "your masters" referring to the CIA dough.

        EDIT: Also, I don't think it's a matter of the sentence being poorly written, so much as me being trained to grasp at straws when it comes to foreshadowing

          Dammit, how did you already figure out my twist about the black ops pastry shop? 

          > so much as me being trained to grasp at straws when it comes to foreshadowing

          Well, that's good. At least one person is likely to pick up any clues that I drop (I have a tendency to make them too subtle...)
