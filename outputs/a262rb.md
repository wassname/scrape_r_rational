      The best movies should have philosophical questions or moral conundrums to keep you thinking about it long afterwards. This is especially true for sci-fi movies which can explore sensitive current issues with a layer of abstraction (Deep Space Nine great example for a TV show). The cartoon, whilst catchy and amusing, completely ignores the interesting questions that could arise by just spacing everything and then everyone.
