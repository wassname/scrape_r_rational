## [D] The Masquerade (HP)

### Post:

Consider the canonical world of Harry Potter. Healing potions and spells work on muggles, wizards are very rare and magical cores do NOT exist. Basically consider the world of Harry Potter with the magic exactly as it is in the books.

I have two questions. First, would there historically be any reasons to separate from muggles and promote any kind of masquerade at all? Second, assuming that there was such a masquerade, how would it be accomplished? Assume that the majority (90%) of muggles and wizards are rational most (90%) of the time.

  One explanation: The "modern" magical community contains state-sponsored education, so every modern witch and wizard knows enough to defend themselves from an angry mob of Muggles. This, however, was not always the case: For a long time, magic was something you figured out on your own or from a single knowledgable master. Because HP magic is basically "know a word", most people would live and die with just enough knowledge to be dangerous, but not enough to evade a clever, focused organization of Muggles. In that case, it's in everyone's best interests to maintain a masquerade and collect knowledge. Over the timescales involved, this becomes tradition, and precisely *because* of the force a magical authority can bring to bear, violating said tradition is much more costly than just going with it.

  Not rational, but humans really aren't at times.

    That seems like a plausible explanation. Much of the witch hunting in history was done by local mobs after all.

  Reasons to keep separate ... there aren't many. A muggle isn't a threat to a wizard of any skill, given the spells they have available. My normal assumption with the Masquerade is that it's defensive in nature, but in the Harry Potter world, that's just not the case. They're no risk of a muggle sneaking into a wizard's house at night and killing them. Wizards don't have to worry about muggles using poisons either. Wizards can literally make a charm so that muggles don't notice them, never mind having to have defensive measures. Wizards can just teleport away if there's any threat, or destroy the muggle in any number of ways (including assuming direct control, modifying their memories, etc.).

  So to make it work, we need to assume that wizards aren't spending that much in the way of keeping the Masquerade going. That means that they can have more marginal reasons for the separation. Maybe wizards just don't have any use for muggles; muggles can't really do anything that magic can't do better, cheaper, and faster. Walling off the magical world from the mundane one is just the most efficient way of not having to deal with muggles.

  As for how they'd do it, the muggles are going to do most of the work for them. If a muggle sees a man running through the streets with a sword, the first thought is something along the lines of cosplay, prank, etc. If a muggle sees a man disappear into thin air, they're usually going to think it was a trick of the light, and most of them aren't going to *tell* anyone (and if they do, the person they tell isn't going to believe them). So conformity and biases do 90% of the work. Anti-muggle fields cover another 5%. Wizards don't often interact with muggle society anyway, so there's not that much to cover up. But when there *is* something to cover up, that's where the Ministry sends someone in to modify some memories.

    The explanation I am most familiar with, is that while a Trained wizard is immune to muggle violence, children are not. Consider a muggle born magical child in 14th century England. Accidental magic is viewed as consorting with demons, and the child is burned at the stake before they are old enough to get their Hogwarts letter. By convincing the muggles that magic does not exist, the accidental magic is written off as weird coincidences and largely ignored.

  Canon HP notes that witch burning was ineffective since the magic user would cast a flamefreezing charm then pretend to burn.  Secrecy is held in place largely through memory charms and faking explanations for things too big to cover up (for example, dragons eating wilderness hikers or Pettigrew blowing a dozen people by puncturing a gas pipe).

  HPMoR gives plenty of reasons why a fully developed wizard should not be afraid of muggles as they should be of other wizards, namely the ability to apparate out of danger and Avada Kadavra if necessary.  However, muggles do have threats that should make wizards wary, such as sniper rifles and explosions, i.e. anything that does not allow the wizard time to react to the threat.

  So a rational magical community would have probably been working on protection from firearms for the past 400 years.  I would imagine shields a la *Dune* stopping any projectiles at lethal speeds.  Fred and George made shield hats in book 6, so it's possible to enchant clothing and other wearable objects with some (semi-)permanent protective charm.

  So I would say given mostly rational actors, it's really up to the wizards whether or not implement the statute of secrecy.  And if they do choose to create a masquerade, it's not for their own safety.  The reason Hagrid advances (in book 1) is that muggles would hassle wizards to help them, but that doesn't hold water as there are magical spells designed to distract muggles or hide wizards from interference.

  I believe the reason JKR gives for the statute of secrecy is that the wizarding world didn't want wizards interfering with muggles, treating them as subhuman (subwizard?) or animals.  The backstory is that the Malfoys made their fortune pre-statute through mutually beneficial arrangements with royalty and nobles of the time.  Then after statute, they switched to advocating pureblood ideology (which is supposed to preserve their advantages of wealth and power for reasons I have forgotten), looking down at interactions with muggles or at most using them as an exploitable resource.

  I think the canon HP explanation is that Muggles have nothing to *offer* wizards - well, they didn't; there are one or two bits of modern technology that are mildly interesting. On the other hand, wizards have a ton to offer Muggles; so they'd be constantly *trying* to trade, or take help by force, which is fairly annoying.

  The analogy of the Third World comes to mind, I guess, or maybe vagrancy laws. People begging for help all the time, when we don't want to provide it, just *get in the way*.

  (And, from a slightly altruistic perspective, the inexplicable inequality *was* messing up Muggle society.)

  It seems that for most of human history, wizards did not maintain a separation or a masquerade. We have innumerable historical accounts of magicians, witches, holy men, etc doing magical things. It's only been in the past 100-200 years that these have disappeared. So the real question is: What Changed Recently?

  An important clue: high-tech stuff doesn't work around wizards. Harry had to rely on a fancy mechanical watch. It seems like most things that involve electricity, and certainly anything that involves circuitry, just shuts down entirely. How much of our world nowadays depends on high-tech gadgets? People with pacemakers depend on them for life. Everyone I know carries around a supercomputer in their pocket. The entire modern economy would grind to a halt without modern computers. I recall hearing a tech expert at a convention relating how in the late 70s (early 80s?) he was arguing Moore's Law with someone and he said "That's all well and good, but what the hell would anyone do with computer chips that small and cheap? Put them in our door knobs?" He then pulled out the keycard to his hotel room and said "Turns out, we did just that."

  Wizards may have removed themselves from society as technology got going as a *favor* to the muggles, so they could continue to progress and raise themselves higher. Perhaps even at the request of, or in cooperation with, the muggle authorities. Much like The Matrix, The Masquerade may be a fundamentally Friendly action.

  Yes, there are historical reasons. 

  One, not every witch or wizard attends Hogwarts even in the present day. So not everyone knows the spells and charms we take for granted in canon, even now. I imagine this would be even worse in a time with a high illiteracy rate; at least homeschooled magical folk today can buy the books and study them.

  Two, not every witch or wizard is as powerful as the ones we're used to. Harry has almost prodigious levels of raw talent/power - he can cast a fully corporeal Patronus capable of driving off almost a hundred Dementors at thirteen. The staff at Hogwarts can be assumed to be at the very top of their field, with evidence - Snape was inventing spells and improving potions while still a teenager himself, McGonagall has performed some incredible transfigurations and is an Animagus, Dumbledore is Dumbledore, etc. Hermione studies everything within reach. And so on, and so forth - but there are weaker, stupider, less talented people around. Just look at Crabbe and Goyle. Or even Harry's constant struggle with Transfiguration.

  Three, magical folk depend heavily on their wands and there has only recently been reform in wand production (by the current Ollivander). Prior to his strict adherence to dragon heartstring, phoenix feather and unicorn hair, people used whatever magical item they could come across. Those items made for weaker wands. Also, Ollivander is the one who went all anal-retentive on their asses about the wand choosing the wizard; even in the present day some families still pass on wands to children that may not be suited for them (see Ron getting Charlie's wand, for instance). Speaking of Ron, wands themselves are quite fragile. They're, well, sticks. And they can be snapped. As has been shown, a broken wand is potentially disastrous for its owner. The long and short of it is that witches and wizards have been walking around with weak, temperamental wands for centuries (it's also worth noting that wands aren't suited to every kind of spellwork).

  Four, some magic is just not accessible to everyone. Not everyone can Apparate without splinching. Not everyone has the focus and intent to successfully cast an Unforgivable. Not everyone can master nonverbal and/or wandless magic, or even learn enough of it to be significantly useful in a fight. Speaking of fights, not everyone has the physical reflexes to duel successfully - some people just have slow reaction times. Et cetera.

  In conclusion, while the characters we see in the books would likely be able to get themselves out of any Muggle-related scrape, there is a [significant] portion of the wizarding population that's still very vulnerable to Muggle attack. In fact, most characters in the books would be helpless (magically-wise) if they were by chance caught without their wands, and as a Muggle myself I daresay we're intelligent enough to figure out that we do *not* go for the magic guys when they have their super sticks in hand. Also there's the fact that betrayal does not always come in the hands of a raging lynch mob.

  There is also the fact that wizarding society simply might not want to involve itself with Muggle politics, which would contribute to the sustenance of the masquerade. I mean, if they broke the International Statute of Secrecy now and came out like "Hi guys, we exist" they wouldn't run into serious persecution since we're mostly so chill about that sort of thing now. But holy cow would militaries everywhere bust a collective nut at the thought of that kind of power. They'd be forced to cooperate (and likely be dissected, experimented on and more or less treated like lab rats) or enter into a war they can't sustain. Never mind the inexorable shifting of the power balance: four hundred years ago magical folk might have been in the top class of society when it came to knowledge and effective influence, but man have those tables turned.
