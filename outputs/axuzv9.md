  I love, love love love, the fact that independently the Legions and Cordelia came to exactly the same plan: a face-saving victory by Procer followed by the Legions bailing ... and then Tyrant fucked it all up in grand style.

  I swear, that man's Role is "fucker-up of plans".

  Well... that was a filler chapter if I've ever seen one. 

  Probably more interesting for the people who try to follow the military manouvering going on, but as I generally ignore it this chapter felt pretty hollow.

    It is important stage setting for the coming battles.

    Seven mortal rulers and one are probably close, this will be big.

      Does.... the Pilgrim count as the "and one"? Sounds like it to me.

        My money's on Saint. I don't think it's a mistake we're reminded the Regicide is with Pilgrim.

        Well, we were recently reminded that he's supposed to be the actual "Seljun" or whatever due to his Bloodline.  He just rejects it to do Pilgrim things.  But it's also very likely that they need him against the Dead King, as he's probably the one guy who can handle massive amounts of Undead effectively.

        The Saint of Swords, though, has been confirmed to kill them as well, and I can't remember if she's supposed to be royalty or blood, but even if she has no direct ties, it's still thematic *because* she is a powerful Named.  If a nation traces its royal lineage back to the blood of heroes, it stands to reason that a sufficiently powerful named (like Saint) is the equivalent of royalty.  Plus, she's the one that Cat is building a magical nuke to defeat.

        Most likely it will be Saint, although it's entirely possible **EE** could pull some trick on us and have Pilgrim sacrifice himself to save her and then her 'join' Cat's side.  Highly unlikely, but sometimes writers like to make the story 'juke' like that.
