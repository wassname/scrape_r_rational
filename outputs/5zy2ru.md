## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  Brag: this is the first (UK tax) year where I donated a full 10% of my income, and as such I'm finally taking an official GWWC pledge and should soon show up on [their members page](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/).

  In the end since the end of tax year was approaching and I still wasn't decided on where to donate, I chose to put 5/6 of the total donation budget towards [GWWC Trust Fund](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/trust) (i.e. basically 'givewell-chosen charities'), and 1/6 towards existential risk ([FHI](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/), because they get gift-aid and so my donations are immediately 20% more valuable).

  This actually took quite a bit into my savings - maybe not half of what I saved this year, but probably at least a third. Seems like I wasn't anywhere near my 45% saving goal; I'll have to start watching my spending much more closely.

  Anyone knows examples of works of fiction with complicated yet internally consistent time_travel-based conflicts? I know *[Primer](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/Primer)* is supposed to be one, though I didn't watch it yet; anything else?

  From my experience, time travel in fiction is either:

  1. Inconsistent. The time travel mechanic is vague, and used as Deus Ex Machina which can do anything/can't do anything as the plot demands. The story's plot is either *intuitive* (and therefore easy-to-follow), no matter how meaningless if you stop to think about it, or reduced to non-TT-based conflicts. (Example: *[Doctor Who](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Series/DoctorWho)*.)

  2. Underused. The characters who have time-travel devices forget to use them, or use them incompetently. Again, the plot is either reduced to non-TT-based, or intuitive yet meaningless. (Example: *[Mirai Nikki](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Manga/FutureDiary)*.)

  3. Restricted to reduce complexity. Only one side of the conflict has access to the time machine (example: *[Mother of Learning](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/MotherOfLearning)*), or the time-travel devices' capabilities are restricted, by the mechanic or by the society (example: *[HPMOR](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/FanFic/HarryPotterAndTheMethodsOfRationality)*). Basically, in the end it's *not* a story about time-travel battles, the time travel isn't central to its main conflict.

  The works that can't be fit into the three above categories are very rare, which is understandable: their plot would get ridiculously complicated, hard to both write and follow. Alexander Wales' *[Branches on the Tree of Time](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9658524/1/Branches-on-the-Tree-of-Time)* would be on the *simpler* side of the spectrum, to give an example.

  Which makes it all the more interesting, doesn't it?

  **Edit:** Thank you for the recommendations, everyone.

    I'd second both *Palimpsest* by Charles Stross (for my money, the best time travel story ever written) and *The Time Traveler's Wife* by Audrey Niffenegger (my favorite time travel story), though the later is probably too restricted/simple for your tastes.
    ```

  - u/Xjalnoir:
    ```
    It's admittedly been a long time since I watched it (and it's played for laughs, so I can't promise how *consistent* it might be, but I remember it doing time travel better than most), but *Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure* is a movie where a duo of hedonists is bootstrapped into completing a closed time loop to uplift humanity into a golden age inspired by their ethics and example, involving multiple precommitment-triggered acausal strategies (including a precommitment fight over which side would defeat the other and set up both sides attacks once they had control of the time machine) and characters realizing that 'wait, we're not good enough at this, but we have a time machine' and going back to train and vacation and party with historical hot babes for a few years in the middle of an important challenge. My favorite part is that these characters are lovable idiots, but it's *still* really obvious to them (when they take a few seconds to think about it) how useful time travel is.

      - u/None:
        ```
        The mid challenge training is during Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey. And I think the precommitment he's talking about is [spoilers from the first movie](#s "Leaving the keys in place, setting up the trash can and such")
        ```

        - u/Xjalnoir:
          ```
          Oh shit, did I mix up the two movies? It's entirely possible. But I could have sworn the mid-challenge training was from the end of *Excellent Adventure*.

    You might be interested in [All Night Laundry](http://www.all-night-laundry.com/), a webcomic focusing around readers suggesting actions for the protagonist to enact, where the protagonist has spooky time travel powers that are actually internally consistent and well thought out, only the protagonist has to figure them out through trial and error in desperate attempts to survive.

    Steins;gate is one of my favorite anime and has a prominent time-travel element though I'm not sure how well it fits your criteria, it's been a while since I watched it.
    ```

    - u/vakusdrake:
      ```
      Idk, Steins Gate has that BS time travel trope wherein certain (human level) events are supposedly fixed and can't be altered (thus convoluting things enough for there to be a story). I mean I certainly can't think of a better time travel anime, but it still uses the kind of tropes the author says he's avoiding.
      ```

      - u/InfernoVulpix:
        ```
        It's not exactly that 'events are fixed' which bothers me, it's more that said events are so human-level.  It's not even "X dies in Y circumstance" it's "X dies" and any circumstance which results in X dying is allowed.

        Even *that's* not fundamentally bad, because it could've made sense if they talked about souls and said that a soul is a fundamental thing which time travel does care about, so if a person dies Time makes sure their soul ends up leaving their body even if you go back.  But they *didn't*, they just sort of said the death is a 'significant event' somehow and sort of assumed we'd be okay with the fundamental laws of the universe working on macroscopic, human-intuitive rules.

        If you had certain, arbitrarily-defined areas of time and space (as in "Within this volume from time A to time B") where things couldn't change even through time travel, that could make sense where Time acts as an agent to cause minute changes to the world such that, in a reverse butterfly effect, events there happen in exactly the same way.  Even if you attach it to souls as fundamental objects and have Time say 'yeah, this soul's dying at this time, butt out time-travellers' it could still make sense.  You just have to not shove it all off onto 'well a death is a major thing, don't think about it too much'.

    I think the [Orthogonal Trilogy by Greg Egan](https://www.amazon.com/Clockwork-Rocket-Orthogonal-Book-ebook/dp/B006NZBFD2) is an edge case. I think it has the single best time travel mechanic of anything I've ever read, and the story is centred around using it to save the word. 

    That said, there's no real time-travel based conflict since time travel is somewhat difficult and takes a lot of manpower and energy, but there's some cool stuff in there nevertheless.

  - u/veruchai:
    ```
    From memory I would say "The Time Traveler's Wife" is the most consistent and logical time travel story I know, although it's probably not what you're looking for as it's more a man vs nature type thing. 

    If you are specifically looking for time travel battles 'Primer' is definitely the most acclaimed.  
    "Time braid" has some exploits but indeed restricts contact for most of the story.  
    I suppose you're right that it's just hard to get a functional story from the premise as I can't even think of bad examples.

  I'm kinda lost on the whole point of becoming skilled at something. From what I've seen, pretty much none of the problems which need to be solved (i.e. work that needs to be done) are solvable using what I've learned in my major / internships / jobs / etc. I don't see any potential contribution out of a degree or career in computer science. Maybe I like proper role models, but the people around me are wanting to make little mobile games and apps and I can't help but find it *astoundingly* pointless. Like, what the *hell* are they doing? What do they know that I don't? Facebook is one of the largest and most complex systems created by man, but *it's not an improvement*. But I don't see how I'm supposed to do any better than *that*, and it basically invalidates the entire field for me. I've talked to scientists and other engineers about what we actually need to do to make progress, and it's all *politics*, it's all *tangental* to my expertise. And if that's true, then what on earth is it for? Is it really so ineffective? Somebody please prove me wrong, because I can't comprehend how other people cope with this.

    In [this essay](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/), Bret Victor tried to sketch out a map of where technical skill is needed for the problem of climate change — systems for producing, moving, and consuming clean energy; tools for building them; media for understanding what needs to be built. Your comment reminds me of this section [The world is not what you see.](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/#coda-see)
    The following are direct quotes from that link:



    Mikey Dickerson, an engineer who left Google to head up the heroic rescue of healthcare.gov, concluded a recent talk with a plea to the tech crowd:



    >This is real life. This is your country... Our country is a place where we allocate our resources through the collective decisions that all of us make... We allocate our resources to the point where we have thousands of engineers working on things like picture-sharing apps, when we’ve already got dozens of picture-sharing apps.



    >We do not allocate anybody to problems like [identity theft of kids in foster care, food stamp distribution, the immigration process, federal pensions, the VA]... This is just a handful of things that I’ve been asked to staff in the last week or so and do not have adequate staff to do...



    >These are all problems that need the attention of people like you.



    100,000 people [≈ population of Virgin Islands] received an engineering bachelor’s degree in the U.S. last year. There are at least 100,000 people, every year, looking for an engineering problem to solve. I have my own plea to all such people —



    >The inconveniences of daily life are not the significant problems.
    The world that scrolls past you on Twitter is not the real world.
    You cannot calibrate your sense of what’s valuable and necessary to the current fashions in your field.



    One sometimes gets the feeling, as Ian Bogost put it, of rearranging app icons on the Titanic. I think the tech community can do better than that. You can do better than that.



    Climate change is one of the problems of our time. It’s everyone’s problem, but it’s our responsibility — as people with the incomparable leverage of being able to work magic through technology.



    In this essay, I’ve tried to sketch out a map of where such magic is needed — systems for producing, moving, and consuming clean energy; tools for building them; media for understanding what needs to be built. There are opportunities everywhere. Let’s get to work.

    * Automation is a major step towards Fully Automated Gay Space Luxury Communism, as is the code infrastructure for collective ownership of automated infrastructure.

    * Geeze, dude, ML/AI is a field in CS.  If you can't think of ways to apply that for good or world-changing evil, what are you doing on this sub?

    * So go into politics.  We need good people to purge and repopulate the political system right now.  RunForSomething.org is a good resource, and if you don't live in a city like mine, you're definitely not surrounded by a surplus of *good* representatives.  If what we need is politics so the scientists can work, do it.

    But yes, I very much sympathize with feeling that most of the computing profession today is appallingly bourgeois and chasing pointless pseudo-business opportunities for the VC/BigCorp noble class.

    I joined computer science because I think it's the easiest way to change the world. 
    Automation and interconnection give us new possibilities. 
    However, they are not used to their full potential.
    Thus, I come.
    I learned stuff about CS because I had projects. Not the other way around.

    If you don't what you can make, you can either search for what you can make, or leave the field and go where you think you will be more efficient.
    What do /you/ think we need to make progress?

    As for other people, it has already been said that a majority does not care about changing the world. So they don't have to cope.

  - u/coolflash:

    I can't prove you wrong, I sympathise. What I think of as the "standard" answer, is that you try not to make things worse while continuing "basic research", because you don't want to be part of a problem while you perceive it might be a problem, and you need to give your future self a better chance of solving things / thinking better than your current self.

    Do you mean "the things I learned do not seem applicable to the problems I'm solving", or "the problems I'm solving, while helped by the skills, are not contributing"?

    > Maybe I like proper role models, but the people around me are wanting to make little mobile games and apps and I can't help but find it astoundingly pointless. Like, what the hell are they doing? What do they know that I don't?

    Well, most of little games and apps are not actually very useful, sure. Though, providing good entertainment to people *is* valuable. Do you play games? Do you not enjoy the fact that they exist?

    But if you do not like the idea of people playing your game / using your app, you probably shouldn't be building those things

    > Facebook is one of the largest and most complex systems created by man, but it's not an improvement. 

    Do you mean Facebook alltogether is not an improvement, or that it's large and complex is not an improvement?

    The first is a pretty big claim; and I know it's been popular recently on both reddit and ycombinator (and facebook) to say that, but I really don't think I've seen this argued well. Facebook is *great*, it's a constant source of amusement for me, and it helps me stay... well, maybe not *in touch*, but at arms-length with people that I would have become complete strangers with otherwise.

    > But I don't see how I'm supposed to do any better than that, and it basically invalidates the entire field for me.

And if that's true, then what on earth is it for? Is it really so ineffective? Somebody please prove me wrong, because I can't comprehend how other people cope with this.

    What do you mean by *progress*? In any case, it's most definitely not *just* politics. Politics steer people towards certain tasks; you still need boots on the ground skilled with those particular tasks to solve them. You can't, as a single person, change the world. But you can make the world a brighter place for some people (games and other entertainment), or build tools that make other people's work easier (business service/product development), or make personal life easier for some (personal product/services). And that's really enough.

  If anyone's in the mood for some light satire, I enjoyed some of the "clickventures" at Clickhole, a clickbait-parody site run by The Onion.  These three in particular may be of interest to some here:

  [MEIOU & Taxes](http://www.reddit.com/r/meiouandtaxes), the biggest mod for [*Europa Universalis IV*](http://www.reddit.com/r/eu4), is on its way to becoming *even more* historically-accurate (and *slightly less* processor-straining) than it already is, if you weren't aware.

  (The modders are too lazy to consolidate their own updates in a concise forum thread or cross-post them to Reddit, and I apparently was the only person who cared enough to take up the mantle when the previous archivist abandoned his post.)

  I got around to finishing *[Significant Digits](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/p/significant-digits.html)*, on my second attempt. Mister Egeustimentis was pretty cool (remember [that *Partially Kissed Hero* sequence where Queen Alice of Wonderland turns Harry's soul into a garden for the secondary characters to trim](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771/82)?), but the ["frontloaded mysteries"](http://www.anarchyishyperbole.com/2015/04/significant-digits-chapter-one.html) that permeate the story really grated on my nerves (I dropped my first attempt at reading it because I was too impatient for the exposition to catch up with the story's events). So far, IIRC, *[Ginny Weasley and the Sealed Intelligence](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11117811)* is the only *HPMoR* continuation that I've particularly liked--though I can't at this point remember my reasons, since I read it *quite* a while ago and only once. I guess I should re-read it...

    Not sure which is best for high level, but there are a heck of a lot of classes online these days. I see stats courses at Coursera, Udacity, MIT OpenCourseWare, Stanford Online, and EdX. r/statistics or r/askstatistics may have helpful info.

    Also if you have the time and discipline to focus on learning without the carrot/stick of a degree, worth noting that most college professors won't chase you off if you sit in on their classes. [This guy](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/03/the-man-who-snuck-into-the-ivy-league-without-paying-a-thing/386917/) apparently sat in on Ivy League classes regularly. The main advantage of doing that over online courses is that you could make social connections typical to a university experience (and become socially acclimated to the types of people who graduate universities). I imagine the social/networking benefits of "ghosting" at a high end / ivy league university would be higher than at a local community college or state university.

    For getting college credit on stuff you've learned, there are various options like CLEP, DANTES/DSST, AP (which is supposed to be high school, but has no actual age restriction), and various other options like portfolio evaluation and challenging the class. One possible way to graduate high end school without paying as much tuition would be to get most of the requirements met at lower-end schools and then transfer the credits to the high end school for the final semester.
