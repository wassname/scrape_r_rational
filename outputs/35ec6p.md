  Officially in love with Gaelwyn's origin story. This is some exposition I most certainly Do Not Mind.

  Of course someone would try to brute-force check the domains of kids at an early age. That makes perfect sense. It's a shame that fame isn't a limitless quantity, since an army of illustrati would be *bad-ass*.

  Speaking of limitless fame, population growth should be a primary goal. I wonder how that could be accomplished. Reminds me of 2YE's Neklos and his army of undead. Doesn't sound feasible, though, given the listed domains.

  Anyway, those theories about all people having basic, subconscious bodily domains is ... well, it kinda feels like it makes sense. I wonder how in hell a world like this could ever possibly evolve. I kinda feel like that isn't quite within the scope of this fic, though.

  And, of course, Gaelwyn's scientific pursuits. I think he's my favorite character. Last chapter, Vidre; this one, Gaelwyn. Remarkable how quickly you're selling me! Credit to you as usual, /u/alexanderwales.

    I don't think that's the actual reason - it's a plausible hypotheses within the scope of the story, but given that it works just fine in the real world without the need for magic, I'm betting it's just a case of misattribution.

      My understanding was that Gael successfully proved blood was produced by the bone marrow and not by domain genesis. They might still not understand the exact celular processes that are involved in it's creation, but I don't think the latent domain theory is still taken seriously (at least by those who understood Gaelwyn paper.)

        Basically this. It doesn't hurt that his name sounds like [Galen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen), one of the earliest and most famous medical researchers. His texts were used for over a thousand years. Mostly wrong of course, but still well advanced for the time.

        Gaelwyn seems to step into a similar role, with a popular opinion on him matching with those you'd expect coming out of a concentration camp doctor or Unit 731. Medical experimentation is unsurprisingly terrifying to the common person, and non-consensual experimentation on prisoners of war even moreso.

        Gaelwyn himself seems to have some kind of greater good morality, judging by the last line of this chapter. He has some ethical boundaries, but is willing to overcome them in certain situations.

  Nitpick thread:

  > He set the clothes on the bed. “Get dressed as soon as you’re finished, it won’t be long now. There are people who want an introduction.”

  > They were noble’s clothing.

  The last sentence is problematic, especially because of the intervening quotation mentioning "people". The pronoun "they" should probably be avoided. (Without so much distance, it would be fine. "I hate these clothes. They make me look fat.") "The clothes were for nobles", or anything else, would be better.

  > It included

  Pluralization mismatch (this is still referring to "the clothes").

  > The sunlight glinted off it

  You can often get away with eliding words (especially in speech), but "off of it" would probably sound better here, since it's narration.

  >  just for a send off.

  The phrase "send-off" is usually hyphenated.

  > and otherwise wearing tan-colored clothing, with little of the accents that Dominic’s own clothes had.

  I observe that a fair amount of space is devoted to describing clothing, but in generic terms (tan-colored clothing). Seems like something specific should be noted here.

  > “It’s unfortunate, I agree” Dominic nodded.

  Needs a comma.

  > The trip to Maskoy was marvelous, seeing the minarets towering over the city and eating the black-spiced food.

  Sounds like the minarets were eating food.

  > It was an utter relief when Vidre slipping into the circle of conversation and politely informed

  slipped.

  > and they would have to take their leave unless they [...] the ship was finally ready to take its leave.

  Repetitive. Seems like the ship should depart, or cast off, or whatever it is that ships do. (It casts off later.)

  >  There was a bard near Grantholm, a story-teller

  This occurrence is hyphenated, but a later one is not. I recommend dropping the hyphen.

  > The point,” he looked toward Vidre, “Is that 

  "is" should probably not be capitalized, since it's in the middle of his sentence.

  > Wealdwood stirred slowly, ineffectually strained against his bonds with his disconnected muscles.

  I don't know what grammar rule is involved here, but "stirred, strained" doesn't sound right. It should be "stirred" followed by "straining". I believe it's because you're further describing a single action. (If it were "stirred, then strained" then it'd be okay.)

  > “Lightscour has my full authorization to kill you

  This is a stylistic question, but "authorization" seems like an awfully modern word. Not sure what kind of flavor you intend to have here. ("Billion" gave me pause earlier, but I looked it up and it began to be used surprisingly early.)

  > She placed one of her daggers in his hand, left the room without waiting for a response.

  Needs "in his hand, then left" or "in his hand and left".

  > I was running low on coin, and forced to work at making boats,

  I believe this needs "was forced", despite the presence of the first "was".

  > Yet there were flaws; he had little feeling in his legs and feet, and disorders of the body.

  "and disorders of the body" doesn't sound right ("had" doesn't connect to it properly). Probably needs a verb like "suffered".

  > who brought be back from the brink

  me.

  > As the it went,

  As the what?

  Fun chapter! I liked taking some time away from the main story, similarly to how I enjoyed Worm's interludes.

    When SotL is over, I'm going to have to have an editor go through and mark it up. Thank you though, this is very helpful. I've made all the suggested changes.
