  Good illustration of a utility function gone very logically wrong, I like this story a lot.

  Meanwhile [Shamus Young's blog](http://www.shamusyoung.com/) is also a good read (even if it's not especially "rational" in the ratfic sense) for anyone interested in video games, layman-accessible explanations of programming concepts, or a webcomic formed by captioning the LOtR movies to turn them into a D&D campaign.

  He's a generally good/entertaining writer, I would subscribe to his newsletter were I not already subscribed more conveniently by RSS.

  The first AI goes mad after our protagonist is hired to hack it. [Light spoilers for first third](#s "Waking up weeks later the only reason he survives is because he included a directive to ignore any mention of his name, and the AI still can't modify its utility function.")
  ```

  I don't know when I'm going to get to read this, but it's definitely on my list. Thanks for posting it.

  This is a very good story, and one of the ones that got me into web fiction. At one point, I'm going to find the time to read it again.
