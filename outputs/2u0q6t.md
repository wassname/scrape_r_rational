  Who has a higher bounty than Kakashi? Sarutobi, Jiraiya, maaaybe Tsunade (if she even counts as a leaf shinobi), but that's only 3? People like Nara Shikaku (Jonin Commander) and Hyuuga Hiashi, but I'd still be missing one somewhere?

    Could just be an entry for "leaf's jinchuuriki". Most other names I can come up with (Danzo, Asuma, etc) don't really fit very well.

  I liked this chapter.

  You are really changing a lot of the mechanics from canon, which I am finding a bit hard to keep track of, but as long as I roll with the changes as they are relevant it isn't too jarring.

- u/Anderkent:
  ```
  Liked this chapter more than the previous ones. Kakashi is surprisingly reasonable
  ```

- u/4t0m:
  ```
  I really like how the experience of using the Sharingan is described in this fic.  Is that canon/fanon/your own description?
  ```

- u/Kodix:
  ```
  Neat. Gotta like Shadow Clone abuse.
  ```

- u/Jello_Raptor:
  ```
  Can you please cancel your prefixes out? For some reason "A few hundred-thousand millichakra" annoys me immensely. "A few hundred chakra" would be much nicer.
  ```

  - u/daydev:
    ```
    Another opinion: I don't mind. 

    And just "chakra" doesn't even make much sence when talking about *parts* of chakra. 

    Also, I think the author is going to mostly stick to abbreviation "mc" now that it's established.
    ```
