  Hah, very nice chapter. Interested to see what's going on with Shikamaru... By the way, you could consider including a last-updated date note in your sig on SV.

    Glad you liked it. A last updated note? I'm not dismissing it out of hand, but it seems a bit redundant considering anyone can just hit watch thread.

      Aah, didn't think of that... I'm not used to using functions like that on forums, as by past experience it ends up spamming my e-mail, although that may not be the case on SV, I'll have to check and find out.
      ```

      - u/FuguofAnotherWorld:
        ```
        SV gives you a very obvious choice about whether or not you want to be e-mailed about things when you hit watch.
        ```

        - u/Cariyaga:
          ```
          Ahah. Well, more the fool me for not checking.
          ```

- u/Wireless-Wizard:
  ```
  Well, I just read all of that.
  ```
