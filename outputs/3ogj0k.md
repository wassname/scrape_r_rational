## [D] Monday General Rationality Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Monday thread on general rationality topics!  Do you really want to talk about something non-fictional, related to the real world?  Have you:

* Seen something interesting on /r/science?
* Found a new way to get your shit even-more together?
* Figured out how to become immortal?
* Constructed artificial general intelligence?
* Read a neat nonfiction book?
* Munchkined your way into total control of your D&D campaign?

  I have not-so-lately become interested in applied rationality as it applies to writing/selling creative content. [See here](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/3n8fep/d_friday_offtopic_thread/cvopcem), for example. So much of what publishing houses, television networks, and Hollywood studios do seems to be random flailing around. When it's not flailing around, it's following formula, which doesn't work half the time anyway.

  People are doing [post-mortems on *Pan*](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-how-pan-turned-831240), which is the latest box-office flop. I really love these post-mortems, because when I see something like this I wonder how in the hell it happens. They had a budget of $150 million on the line! There were literally hundreds of people trying to make it work! Some of it you can maybe explain by people only doing enough to earn their paycheck, or a studio shifting resources mid-stream when they realized that the movie wasn't going to be good (attempting to avoid sinking resources that weren't going to make their money back). But I don't think that's all of it, because publishing (which is a completely different world) also puts out flops; [7 out of 10 books don't earn out their advance](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/books/review/Meyer-t.html).

  So let's say that you're an author of middling quality. You don't really care what you write, you don't really have any difference in skill with regards to drama, and you've hit some level of diminishing returns on skill. What is your ideal strategy for Making It?

  You can put your finger on the pulse of the market, but everyone else is already doing that, and the time from sitting down to write a novel and seeing it on shelves is [5-6 years if done traditionally or 1-4 years if you self-publish](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/01/the-next-big-thing.html). So if you see that vampires are currently the next big thing, you can't really get in on that, because by the time you finish writing your vampire novel, the market will be flooded with them. If you want to hit the market *right*, you need to anticipate where the market is going to go next, which is very difficult to do. Efficient-market hypothesis strikes again!

  I feel like there must be aspects of human psychology that you can exploit in order to beat out the competition. If you know how and why people are compelled to share things with each other, you can craft something that will spread without having to pay for advertising (or in addition to advertising). I'm of the school of thought that sees stories as being predicated not just on culture, but the structure of the human brain itself; books, movies, and television shows are about delivering hedons, so it makes sense that they would be calibrated for that task. But since most authors/writers don't study human psychology, their calibration is based only on trial and error to see what works and what doesn't. I feel like there's got to be a better way than that.

  (I hope this doesn't edge too far into the rationalist dark arts. I'm not really that interested in applying any of this myself, because writing is a hobby that I do to destress and entertain myself, not something that I'm trying to sociopathically profit from.)

    ...Take exactly [this](https://twitter.com/DystopianYA) but change the names and fill things out a bit? And then wait for the money to happen?
    ```

    - u/scruiser:
      ```
      But the challenge is anticipating these trends.  It's easy to tell right now that Dystopian young adult fiction is hot, but could you predict that 3-5 years ago (when the trend really picked up), or better yet, 5-7 years ago (when the Hunger Games was first being published).  Ideally, you would be able to anticipate the beginning of a trend 1-2 years before it starts to give yourself time to start a book series corresponding to that trend.

      So I think the earliest a prediction could have been made in the case of the Dystopian YA genre would be when the Hunger Games movies was first announced (2009 or 2010?).  The book was pretty popular, and based on the reasonable belief that the movie would do well, an author seeking to cash in on trends could start writing their take on the genre around then.  It would go to the publisher right as the trend got big...  And lets see, Divergent was published in 2011, and the Hunger Games movie was released in 2012...

      It might be that publishers already know how to predict these trends fairly well, and they just sort through manuscripts looking for one that come close to the latest trends.

      edit: Some additional thoughts... It occured to me that Uglies, Pretties, and Specials (by Scott Westerfeld) were all published before Hunger Games was published, much less got big... did they experience a boost in sales in correlation with the Hunger Games getting popular?  If not, then doing thing the way alexanderwales envisions is even harder, because publishing well before a trend starts isn't helpful either, the books need to be ready right as the trend begins.

      - u/alexanderwales:

        Yeah, I hold with Charles Stross' advice, which is basically that if you want to take trends into account, you should steer clear of what the current trend is. Maybe your rip-off of Tarzan isn't going to be what's in vogue, but at least you're not going to land right in the glut of other manuscripts centered around whatever is trendy. And hey, maybe you can get lucky and wind up catching some different trend.
        ```

    - u/alexanderwales:
      ```
      See, this is part of the problem with chasing the market. *Hunger Games* came out in 2008, *The Maze Runner* came out in 2009. The market has been saturated with YA dystopian novels for the last five years. So yes, you could probably churn out a new YA dystopian novel in a handful of months, but then you'd be in competition with all the YA dystopian novels that were trying to ride that wave.

      In fact, back in 2010 when *Hunger Games* was ascendant, the publishers were probably picking already-written manuscripts up from the slush pile, so even if you had seen the trend coming, you'd *still* be behind by however long it took you to write your book.

      It really boils down to game theory; you don't want to go in the same direction as everyone else.

  I think I may have fallen victim to the planning fallacy, and want some advice to recover from it before I end up homeless and destitute on the streets of Tacoma. 

  Some background: I'm from a small town in upstate NY, and had been getting really sick of the place. My roommate and I decided we wanted to go out west and started making plans. We paid for bus tickets, and the first month of a two month planned stay at a converted bus supplied by AirBnB. Then we started saving. By the time we were ready to leave (Sept 28th) we had amassed about 1600 dollars in savings, which would pay for the second month's rent as well as food and transportation and other assorted expenses during the trip and subsequent job hunting period. 

  We've now been in Tacoma for a little over a week, and have put in over 30 resumes each in that time period. We've gotten callbacks for interviews and I'm optimistic about mine, but I don't want to bet too heavily on it working out because I really really do not want to be homeless in Tacoma in December. 

  Now here's the worry, while discussing the planning fallacy with my roommate, it occurred to us to look at how long we were between jobs the last time we were looking for work (him: 4 months and me: 6 months). He'd put in five applications a week during that time. The planning fallacy tells you to look in very broad strokes at how long it took you before, and the answer we get is "Way longer then we have." Not only this, but once homeless, our hiring chances drop even further since we have no safe places to sleep or store our things. 

  I'm looking at ways of avoiding a catastrophe. During his 4 month period without work, my roommate was averaging 5 job applications per week. If we increase that number to 20 per week, it should help, but do those sorts of details also fall prey to the planning fallacy? there are also way, way more jobs around here then there were in my hometown, but that seems like exactly the sort of details that the planning fallacy tells you to pay no attention to. 

  I try to be as forward thinking and rational and proactive as possible. What sort of steps should I be taking *now* while I still have a month and a half buffer, to avoid ending up homeless when our deadline to move out of our AirBnB housing hits?

  I'm curious, is there anyone here who knows Game Theory and has had the opportunity to use it in real life?

    Mh, anytime I throw away litter instead of, well littering I give myself a pat on the shoulder for cooperating. 

    Anytime you use beeminder or leechblock you precommit to stuff. 

    I play a lot of boardgames and every so often you will find someone who is willing to reap the C rewards for not waging war against each other. Of course unfortunately most boardgames have a single person win condition, so this makes this especially hard, yet the more satisfying.

    In Boardgames you also see applied iterated PDs all the time; someone defected spectacularly by performing an epic backstab, breaking a non-agression pact? For months nobody would trust that person again with any pacts. 

    I try to reward people who C in boardgames.

    Depends on what you mean by "real life":

    * Often, at various meta-levels, when playing games with postgraduate economists.  This can be a lot of fun, but I'm not sure it counts as real life.

    * Selection of various things - research topics, books to read, etc - can be made much more productive by starting in areas you have reason to believe are under-investigated for some reason.  Basically just a technique to work out where you might have an advantage.

    * Implicit negotiations - whenever interacting with a corporation, think about how to hack it's incentive structure (*and* that of the person you're talking to).  In what scenario will it be easier for the company/organisation/whatever to give you what you want than deny it?

      * This is just for companies though, since they're generally model-able as rational actors.  People tend to respond better to psychology than game theory though; for negotiations read the book by the FBI hostage guy and the Harvard Business Review.

    * Avoiding situations which resemble negative-sum games, or where it would likely be negative for me (eg dominated by experts, high loss rate, etc).  Basically avoid most forms of speculation and check typical outcomes for your demographics before doing anything really important.

    Most of it is really just understanding a system, and game theory is one useful tool among many.

    A little bit. I was introduced to it when I happened upon [this course by the teaching company](http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/games-people-play-game-theory-in-life-business-and-beyond.html), though of course I was a dirty underage pirate, so I didn't pay their ridiculous prices. We also touched on it in an Evolutionary Psychology course I took at uni. But other than feeding into my armchair psychology, no I haven't used it much.

  There is a hypothesis I need to test.  This requires 3D histograms (histograms or other function/distribution plots) over 2D spaces.

  Anyone know a package in Python for that?

  I posted this in the off topic thread Friday, but realized it's a fairly relevant topic of discussion for rationality in general:

  The actions we take are dictated by a number of factors. Most of us can agree that we are not rational all of the time. There are times when we act or feel in an irrational manner, despite the fact that we may consciously realize we are being irrational.


  Prime Example. Fear. Personally, I know that fear isn't very useful to me. Caution, sure. But the feeling of fear, of ice in your stomach and nervous butterflies, sweaty hands, etc. is mostly useless. I know this rationally. But that doesn't help me in scary situations. And I don't mean viscerally scary situations, like being confronted by an angry bear, or being trapped in a burning building. I mean situations like going into a job interview, or confronting a friend about something they do that I dislike. Logically, I know that there's nothing to be afraid of and, often enough, when I'm in said situation, I perform well. My fear fades, and I can deal with the situation. But the apprehension is a killer and no matter how much I try to rationalize it away, it doesn't leave.


  So. Here's my discussion point. What's the best way(s) to utilize our conscious, rational conclusions and understanding to directly influence our feelings?

  ```
  Are some people's utility functions more complicated than others, or is it just that the further they're removed from our own the more difficult they are to simulate and thus they seem more complicated as a result?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Pretty sure that utility function complexity follows some kind of bell curve distribution. This automatically means some people are on the right and left sides, eg. more complex/less complex. 

    There are indeed people whos UF strongly include kids+family life and who dont need much beside; other people are deeply unsatisfied with such a life. 

    Of course wether or not all these modern day human UF hold up in reflective equilibrium and wether or not they converge or diverge in extrapolated volition is still up to debate.
    ```
