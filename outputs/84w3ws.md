## [D] Friday Off-Topic Thread

### Post:

Welcome to the Friday Off-Topic Thread! Is there something that you want to talk about with /r/rational, but which isn't rational fiction, or doesn't otherwise belong as a top-level post? This is the place to post it. The idea is that while reddit is a large place, with lots of special little niches, sometimes you just want to talk with a certain group of people about certain sorts of things that aren't related to why you're all here. It's totally understandable that you might want to talk about Japanese game shows with /r/rational instead of going over to /r/japanesegameshows, but it's hopefully also understandable that this isn't really the place for that sort of thing.

So do you want to talk about how your life has been going? Non-rational and/or non-fictional stuff you've been reading? The recent album from your favourite German pop singer? The politics of Southern India? The sexual preferences of the chairman of the Ukrainian soccer league? Different ways to plot meteorological data? The cost of living in Portugal? Corner cases for siteswap notation? All these things and more could possibly be found in the comments below!

  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_Waldo_Demara#Impersonations>

  >While at the Brothers of Christian Instruction, he became acquainted with a young doctor named Joseph C. Cyr.[6] That led to his most famous exploit, in which he masqueraded as Cyr, working as a trauma surgeon aboard HMCS Cayuga, a Royal Canadian Navy destroyer, during the Korean War. He managed to improvise successful major surgeries and fend off infection with generous amounts of penicillin. His most notable surgical practices were performed on some sixteen Korean combat casualties who were loaded onto the Cayuga. All eyes turned to Demara, the only "surgeon" on board, as it became obvious that several of the casualties would require major surgery or certainly die. After ordering personnel to transport these variously injured patients into the ship's operating room and prep them for surgery, Demara disappeared to his room with a textbook on general surgery and proceeded to speed-read the various surgeries he was now forced to perform, including major chest surgery. None of the casualties died as a result of Demara's surgeries.

    The “surgeon” obviously deserves high praise for saving those people with so little training, but I’m just as impressed by the authors of the textbook who communicated so clearly it could be read and implemented like that.

  I came across [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/83jdld/the_dream_of_nuclear_fusion_is_on_the_brink_of/dvint1o/) super interesting comment on the state of fusion power.  If you have an hour, I highly recommend [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkpqA8yG9T4) talk by the leading MIT scientist. 

  TLDR: 
  ITER, the 50 billion$ fusion project, is so big because its limited by last generation superconductors - magnetic field strenght of about 5 tesla. Since then, next gen superconductors have become available on Alibaba(!) and go easily up to 10 tesla and higher. The constraint is no longer field strength, but rather magnet coil structural integrity. Internal pressure at those high field strengths makes the magnets implode.  

  Now, fusion physics has a couple of terms in which magnetic field strength goes in as a power of 3 or even 4. Meaning with this doubling of field strength you get 8 or 16 times better performance - or you can make the reactor smaller by that much.

  Very exciting stuff!

      Ugh! That sucked in college. I had a friend who was really excited about a video game idea of his, but he only knew business and nothing about programing. He wanted me (and one other guy) to make the game. He wasn't rude about it, but the problem was that I was a freshman and didn't know anything about making a video game (maybe a website or simple game of tic tac toe). It ruined the friendship when all he wanted to do was talk about the game and I didn't have the energy to learn very much about building a video game *and* keep up with my coursework at the same time.

      People, being the 'idea guy' is worthless when you are making others do everything to bring it from theory to practical.

      This isn't meant as an attack at you, GaBeRockKing, by the way. It's just a chance for me to rant about slightly unrelated things.

    I currently have collision detection problems. I don't understand how other game developers can program this to be so efficient.

    I mean, look at Obliterate Everything: that's a game where you construct buildings that build ships automatically every few seconds, and the ships that are carriers spawn miniships every few seconds, and those miniships can spray bullets out like crazy. And you can have 3 players fighting each other, spamming those ships out like crazy, yet the game doesn't lag (at least, not as much as you would expect). How the heck is that possible? The game code has to somehow detect collisions between all the countless ships and bullets in real time, which is nuts.

    I looked for tutorials online, and they recommended programming an invisible grid across the entire map, and recording which cell of the grid each bullet/ship is in, and only detecting collisions between bullets/ships in nearby cells. I tried that, but it's still crazy slow. Especially when the map is huge, which it is in Obliterate Everything, considering that ships and bullets can go off-map and then come back.
    ```

    - u/CouteauBleu:
      ```
      Mh... First off, what medium do your calculations span? Are they all on one computer, or are you trying to keep a state consistent between multiple networked computers? If the second... yeah, good luck.

      Otherwise, have you looked into CPU cache optimization? If you have tens thousands of objects that need to interact, then you start needing to either optimize your cache lines or offload work on the GPU.
      ```

      - u/ShiranaiWakaranai:
        ```
        I'll settle for all on one computer, though Obliterate Everything somehow does what it does on multiplayer as well, which blows my mind.

        > Otherwise, have you looked into CPU cache optimization? If you have tens thousands of objects that need to interact, then you start needing to either optimize your cache lines or offload work on the GPU.

        I don't have any idea how to do any of that. :(

          Well, you're not going to figure it out unless you look it up.
          ```

    - u/CCC_037:
      ```
      The first rule of optimisation - do your calculations *outside* the loop, as much as possible. If you're repeating a calculation a million times, then make the art that you repeat *as small as possible*. (An example of a small calculation for collision detection - is the difference in X-coordinate between A and B less than the size of the largest object in your map? If not, they are not colliding, move on to the next one, don't even bother looking more closely than that one-subtraction-and-comparison).

      The second rule of optimisation - don't be afraid to use lookup tables for common calculations.

      The third rule of optimisation - use a profiling tool (gprof is good) to see *exactly* where your code is spending all its time. You don't want to spend six weeks tightening up Function A only to find out that the real bottleneck is Function B.
      ```

      You need to do _some_ kind of spatial partitioning, to escape quadratic complexity of exhaustive pairwise testing. [Real-Time Collision Detection](https://www.amazon.com/Real-Time-Collision-Detection-Interactive-Technology/dp/1558607323) by Christer Ericson covers the topic pretty well.

    Look for programming meetups.  I'm more database back-end guy myself, but we have a lot of people doing game development in the area.  My local MSDN regional rep or my previous MSDN regional rep (Not sure I think he may have gone independent) has a lot of good tutorials on game design and hosts/sponsors hack-a-thons and talks focused on games

    Edit: also if you want ideas and thoughts on the idea process Yandredev while having a creepy subject matter has a pretty good discussion with his fans on youtube about his creative process.

    Yes making games is hard , I'm incapable to sticking to a project , and can't really aim low , so I have a lot of unfinished games .
    Especially when something like exams happens and I get interrupted and don't really feel any motivation to return to the game  .
    It seemed like i was going to finish my last game , since I took notes obsessively enough that I was able to return to it after a while and still know how everything worked, but still I stopped at the start of the year ,and haven't touched it since then(in fact I think it ) .
    The only project  that seems to last for some reason is my pokemon mystery dungeon story /  rpgmaker game /setting  thing ,  maybe because doing worlbulding is addictive and it makes me want to do things whith it, but even then I still keep abandoning and starting new projects  ,its just that its part of the same thing.

    Maybe I should try to participate in more game jams, to force myself to finish something.

    Hope you feel better! What's going on in yours?

    Currently I'm wrapping up a project for a talk at a conference next month; hoping to get the paper submitted before then too. I keep thinking of (and collaborators keep suggesting) additional analyses to perform for the simulation component, which keeps extending the completion date.

    Wife's coming to visit in a few days (her lab moved and took her with it, lest she otherwise forfeit several years of PhD) and we'll be together for a few weeks, for which I'm very excited! We talk for a few hours every night and play video games and watch movies and stuff but I've still missed her deeply. Her absence has actually affected me in a chronic sense more than essentially anything else in my life, but luckily she's wrapping up over the next few months and moving back x-country in the early summer, so not long left!

    Earlier today I got a response for the call for summer teaching assignments -- didn't get the course I wanted but got one I've taught [a few times before](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/3hs0em/taught_a_course_a_few_weeks_ago_on/) (paleoanthro’s maybe half the focus, it's an upper div class on human evolutionary biology) which'll be substantially less work since I'll only have to make fairly minor updates to lecture materials. Pay's pretty good too, at least relative to what I'm used to, around $1k/week for part-time (~20h/w) work, which’s nice cos I’ll be taking a hefty pay cut from when my GRF runs out this year. And it's a fun class to teach (I get a captive audience to listen to me ramble on about stuff I'm interested in, and then we all discuss it afterwards, what's not to love). Listening to music this morning I had a thought to put the following in the syllabus:


    >Your final grade will be computed as a weighted average of course components. A breakdown of those components and their weights follows:


    >Weight| Component
    ---|---
    10% | luck
    20% | skill
    15% | concentrated power of will
    5% | pleasure
    50% | pain


    >In total these weights will sum to 100% reason to remember the name.

    heeheehee I was giggling for much of my walk in lol

    I released a blog post about [programming paradigms](https://digitalfellows.commons.gc.cuny.edu/2018/03/12/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/). I'm going blind and my right eye is feeling pretty fucked up this week. My partner is leaving her job at the end of the month.

      Some feedback on the article:

      - You're not really explaining what state is, or how different languages treat them. Personally, I think functional programming has as much or more "state" than imperative programming; the difference is it has less incoherent / fragmented state, because functional programming makes cache invalidation easier.

      - Imperative programming isn't opposed to functional programming, it's opposed to declarative programming. Imperative programming can have subroutines, so the part about it being more prone to code duplication doesn't really apply.

      (also, I'd argue than object-orientation is less of a paradigm and more of a way to structure both functional and imperative programming, and that it's extremely overused, but that's a personal opinion)

    I got drivers license exam going that i absolutely loathe doing. I am not interested in owning a car even tho i kinda see that its really useful and all but it was mainly the pressure from my family that made me go. And besides the course is really expensive here which isnt ideal when i wanted to realize some of my projects

    like my and my friends smithy that we wanted to make and play in so we can make some swords, blades, armor etc. We are kinda super interesting in blacksmithing and its expensive and now i dont have any money...

    school is getting really annoying when i dont really want to go there. its boring and nonsense mostly but i still need those points for being there...absolutely idiotic especially when half the teachers just go on some other things and we have reductions etc. I live outside town and coming over to school every day in WINTER is especially bothersome. On some days (like today when i had 3 lessons only 1 of which was nonsense organizational lesson with our main teacher) i am spending more time in the bus driving to the school than in the actual school. Our shitty main teacher that i hate yet again went and got us a nice practice in the lab class by doing something for a mark whithout explaining it normally first. She is such a shitty teacher its amazing really. I dont really know what she is doing at this school because its certainly not teaching. She actually hates kids and mostly tries to go on business trips away from school. I dont get it. MOst of the things we do in the lab will need to be repeated with other techears because we learn absolutely nothing from her and like atleast 75% of the things in the lab dont work. Its absolutely frustrating when you need to sit on your butt and do nothing the first hours out of the 3 of the lab we get per week. She is also really spiteful and like nobody likes her in school amongst the students and ofcourse i had to be in class that got her as our homeroom teacher...

    by this time i just said "fuck it" and just focused on the subjects that actually will be on our maturity exam next year or on our job exam this year and disregarded all else. I really need to get into shape and do something positive with my life. Like holy hell and i am sitting all days on reddit or playing games when i am not in school or doing my driving course. Writing some webnovels that i have ideas for or learning programming are amongst the many projects that i prefer finding excuses no to do. The only project i am kinda doing is the wholy smithy thing but its going really slow cuz of money and how rarely i can meetup with my friend because we live on the opposites side of town and his bus drives even rarer than mine(guess having a car now would be cool huh). My life is kinda escaping from my hands i feel like. Laziness is the worst sickness i say.

  Grandparents celebrated their 56th anniversary this week, so I posted a [before/after picture](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/8473rx/what_56_years_of_marriage_does_to_a_couple/) of them and hot damn, reddit is full of a lot more weirdos than you'd expect just reading the undeleted comments. Also, for some reason the thread got removed for an hour+ [right as it hit the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/8473rx/what_56_years_of_marriage_does_to_a_couple/dvo1ycp/), which totally killed its rising momentum, depriving me of many worthless internet points. Oh well! Amusingly this isn't the [first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/etu2s) grandparents have been briefly reddit popular, though this site was like 100x smaller then.

  I also had a full [nutrient/metabolic panel](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/84c9zu/wellness_wednesday_14th_march_2018/dvpmik6/) done, does anyone know of good resources for interpreting the results?

  Finally, how do people perceive the "status play" of individuals with a doctorate introducing themselves as Dr. -Surname-" outside e.g. a medical, professorial, or otherwise professional context? I was watching [the Avengers trailer](https://youtu.be/QwievZ1Tx-8?t=122) from earlier today and it put me in mind of this. Personally, I've always felt it kinda lame not to introduce yourself by your given name, especially if someone has just introduced themselves to you by theirs. It seems like a move to artificially impose hierarchical structure on your interactions (comparable to those aforementioned professional relationships), to elevate yourself above your interlocutor, to brag. I think my reaction to it is in part driven by the impression that almost all the most brilliant doctorate-holders I've known are casual and modest, so to call yourself "Dr. ..." is to signal your own inability to "countersignal" in this way, and betrays a lack of confidence that one's competence can evince itself naturally. The context may change a little if you're talking to someone in their mid-teens (e.g. Peter Parker), and the may indeed be setting up a mentor-mentee relationship, but even so. I guess that hoity-toity-ness is part of Dr. Strange's character, too.

    I'm a med student so I can tell you my impressions of your metabolic panel but consult your doctor since I am obviously still in training. Your B12 is fine, too low levels of B12 can cause anemia but high levels of B12 aren't harmful as far as I know. Don't worry about it too much since your body can store decades' worth of B12 so vegetarianism/veganism alone rarely cause problems unless you have some other condition or are not taking supplements for years. Your family members who have B12 deficiency despite eating meat are probably having problems with absorption or storage in their GI tract rather than not getting enough. Just keep taking supplements. Don't worry about Cl. Different sources give different normal ranges and yours is still within many normal ranges. Besides, the variation is so small and it probably changes slightly throughout your day depending on mealtimes, urination, etc. Your doctor is correct that you don't need to take Vitamin D supplements but it also doesn't hurt to take supplements. It's very difficult to take toxic doses of vitamin D unless you're taking prescription-level vitamin D every day for months.

      Than you for your insight :] what you wrote agrees with my own understanding and cursory google scholaring, except wrt to Vit. D, where I think that 2014 paper rather suggestive. I was mostly worried about B12 deficiency insofar as family history might suggest some underlying inherited condition, but agree that the my own serum levels aren't of great concern. 

      Specifically though I was looking for resources that could be used to roughly identify healthy optima for all the other results (there were like 50+ of them lol). So I don't have to potter around trying to find recent cochrane reviews or meta-analyses or whatever for each.

  Scheduling with a therapist is hard so I’m going to ask for help with an existential question that’s been bugging me for a while. I am not in a depressive episode or contemplating self harm, this is just what I’m thinking about because of the lingering depression in the back of my mind.

  Ever since I first heard about the theory of the singularity, I always sided with Hanson over Yudowsky because I found his predictions both more plausible and more morally acceptable. Yudkowsky’s preference for creating an AI that would optimize humanity never sat well with me, but now I’m worried that I’ve come over to his side for the wrong reasons.

  When I first heard the suggestion for something as simple as banning humans from driving themselves in order to save lives, I was hardline against this because I saw it as a violation of human autonomy and the servitude role of technology. However, my depression and anxiety so often leaves me with no ability to act or think independently that I need my environment to care for me.

  Couple that with revelations about how much more suffering people are in than I ever thought possible due to the circumstances of their existence, and I find myself more inclined to think that life is pain and just want the pain to stop. So I’ve begun to wonder if it is a moral imperative to forcibly change humanity into something that is, by definition, not human so that people experience and cause less pain. 

  Am I becoming a nihilist? Is it mentally healthy to think that the only way to stop the suffering of myself and others is by altering the human mind at a fundamental level? What does that say about my identity or my respect for the rights of others? Am I just rationalizing a scenario in which I would commit suicide and is it better to tie it to an event that may not even happen?

  I don’t think it’s likely that I’ll ever be in a position where I will contribute to a decision about whether to assimilate humanity into a hive mind where our psychology is altered to eliminate prejudice, abuse, discrimination, and mental illness. However, if I got the chance to change myself in that way, I would be inclined to take it due to my self loathing and I don’t know if that is a reason not to do it or evidence that I should take it because of the pain my mind causes me.
  ```

  - u/sicutumbo:
    ```
    The important thing to remember here is that you are in an altered state of mind. It's much subtler than being drunk, but no less severe. Any conclusion or reasoning you make right now is almost certainly going to be influenced in a negative direction, at the very least in terms of your reaction to it. You will then remember your conclusion, but not the negatively influenced reasoning behind the conclusion.

    Even if your ability to reason about these things isn't affected, as would be the case with drunkenness, your emotional reaction to them is certainly altered. This isn't productive towards helping you feel normal again. Hold off on making these type of decision and revelations, and if you feel that "focus on getting better" is too trite or unhelpful, then at least focus on gathering data that opposes your current viewpoint in a more emotionally positive direction. I would recommend reading The Better Angels of our Nature, by Steven Pinker, to counter the despair and cynicism you seem to feel towards current humanity. It's isn't a happy book, as it details a variety of horrific things that humans have done to each other. But I would argue that it's overall a positive book, which doesn't sugarcoat the backslides in moral progress, but does clearly show that upward trend.
    ```

  - u/space_fountain:
    ```
    I think the important thing is always choice. For me personally what your saying sounds like it may come partially from your own history of depression.  I know I personally wouldn't choose to have my mind altered on a fundamental levels. That others might is ok, but I don't think there is need or it allowable to force that on others.
    ```

    - u/trekie140:
      ```
      I would agree with you, but I’m starting to think that the way the human mind is built is one of the reasons people hurt each other as well as themselves. Part of my self loathing is related to my implicit bias and culturally-ingrained stereotypes that effect the way I treat other people without realizing it, so I want that removed from my brain as well so I don’t commit, enable, or tolerate discriminatory and abusive behavior. 

      But if I value my current mental architecture so little that I think it should be changed so I think and act like a person who I consider to be more virtuous, then why should I value the less virtuous minds of anyone else more than my own? I believe that I think dehumanizing thoughts about others and hate myself for it because I believe those thoughts lead to suffering, but that could be used to justify doing the same to anyone else regardless of consent.

      I’d probably be doing it for selfish reasons, “optimizing” humans my way so I feel less bad, but I’m also not sure how much empathy I can actually feel for people who’ve suffered in ways that I haven’t so that rationalization might be the best possible way to optimize utilitarian values. Even if I could test to see if I actually cared instead of just being loyal to an ideal, would it matter if the result is reducing a form of suffering that is never morally justifiable?

    > So I’ve begun to wonder if it is a moral imperative to forcibly change humanity into something that is, by definition, not human so that people experience and cause less pain.

    I think anything that is forcible implies a certain degree of pain because to most humans the feeling of autonomy and freedom is a really important thing - even when it concretises in freedom and autonomy to drive themselves in some shitty corner and make their life worse. I would be wary of applying your personal experiences to everyone. You have no reason to believe that people who claim to be genuinely happy just aren't, for example.

    As a general rule, I am not the sort of person who would be against transhumanism on concerns of sticking to either God's or Nature's supposed "plans" for us - those are bunk for me. But I would say that anything that changed my mind so much that it removed all potential source of pain from it would probably have effectively killed me anyway. The new entity that replaced me would be happy but why should I care? While I exist, it doesn't, and it has no rights nor is it entitled to anything. And a cure for my problems that kills me is not a cure.

    That said, I also think that, luckily perhaps, we will never really get the chance or need to take a practical position on such issues during our lifetimes. At a difference with the most optimist predictions, I don't think such things can be achieved within a human life's time frame yet. For those who will be, it'll be a hard call, but I still think that a good is worth nothing if someone forces it on you. Since individual experience is fundamentally inaccessible, the only way to know what someone desires is to listen to what they say and watch what they do, and therefore individual preference trumps everything else. To come from outside and say "no, I know better than you, *this* is what will make you happy" is nonsense to me.

  Anyway, I was watching TV the other day and there was a plot line that involved people having affairs, and the character who was being cheated on was carrying a bouquet of yellow roses! I said to my partners: "Hey! Yellow roses mean jealousy!". 

  It was... cool.

    Understanding the background history of big scientific and mathematical revolutions helped me to better understand the implications of certain science principles and math theorems.

    For example, knowing that people used to think math (or number theory in particular) would be a way of knowing the Truth of the world helped me to better understand why Godel's theorems proving that there are statements that can't ever be proven true or false is so significant. It helped elucidate why such a theorem is so important to understand.

    I don't know about handy but when I was writing my Shokugeki no Soma fanfiction, I inadvertently learned several things about cooking; nothing too useful as I was mostly doing surface level descriptions but a few interesting tidbits, like what *sous vide* is or about random desserts I'd never heard of (like cake balls)

      > Shokugeki no Soma

      I have a friend who is super into that show (or a similar one) and has recreated several of the dishes. 

      ... I myself learned a lot of those things from *Top Chef*...

        Dishes are pretty interesting; if I was into cooking more, I'd definitely try them out more frequently :)

          I'm obsessed with cooking and baking. It's my birthday party tomorrow and I've basically spent the whole day baking for it! It's a brunch, so I've made a variety of muffins, two quiches - made those last night - and I will probably make some cinnamon rolls after I get home from a friend's birthday party tonight and put them in the fridge overnight to rise.

          And I collect recipes and barely have time to make them all faster than I make them - but I discover some real winners in the course of events, so I'm okay with it. 

          Also - I only cook half the time, the other half the time my long-suffering partners have to make these sometimes elaborate meals...

  Well, [World of Cultivation](https://wwyxhqc.wordpress.com/%E4%BF%AE%E7%9C%9F%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C-world-of-cultivation/) has finally ended, and I though I'd throw out a quick recommendation. It's nowhere near rational enough to deserve its own thread IMHO, but it does keep the xianxia's popcorn fiction feel, without being the sort of thing where, reflecting after a hundred chapters with no character development whatsoever, or xianxia protag sociopathy. 


  It's the story of an irreverent cultivator only in it for the money, an agricultural and technological revolution, and a war between generic xianxia humans, nature spirits with the most developed society and complex magic system, and ~~anthropomorphic pokemon~~ beast spirits who just enjoy the thrill of combat. The cultivation systems are relatively fleshed out, the secondary characters are actually able outdo the protagonist, and are actual characters.

    > without... xianxia protag sociopathy.

    Thank fuck. If you haven't seen it yet, the quest Forge of Destiny on SV seems good at avoiding this too. It at least touches on the protagonist's morals.

    I second the recommendation for Forge of Destiny. I'm also writing a xianxia quest on SV myself called History's Most Mediocre Cultivator about a normal cultivator who's not a sociopath and has no easy cheat to faster cultivation.

      "The Optimised Wish Project", an attempt at a rational Dragonball fanfiction :D. I posted Chapter 1 here some time ago. I'll link Chapter 2 as soon as I manage to get it online. The FictionPress Twitter account said an ETA of 2 hours for fixing their issues one hour ago.

  The Brain Preservation Foundation has recently announced the [successful preservation of a large mammal](http://www.brainpreservation.org/large-mammal-announcement/) brain. This is not a revival experiment, but a preserve-and-verify-with-electron-microscope experiment similar to the [rabbit brain](http://www.brainpreservation.org/asc_rabbit_fulleval/) experiment that got a lot of press a couple years ago.

  Now a YC startup called [Nectome](https://nectome.com) run by Robert McIntyre, the guy behind the rabbit brain experiment, is [pitching](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610456/a-startup-is-pitching-a-mind-uploading-service-that-is-100-percent-fatal/) human preservation within the next few years, and accepting deposits for when they have the capability. Owing to the impracticality of ASC on clinically deceased patients without intact vasculature, this will be restricted to patients covered under assisted suicide laws. Apart from that, it's basically the same deal as cryonics, and no it's not really any more fatal than cryonics (apparently less, from an information theoretic standpoint -- although that's considered a bit hard to measure due to dehydration distortion in cryonics patients).

  Also, relative to cryonics, Nectome also has quite a bit more mainstream cred as a research company, considering that it has won about a million dollars in [grants](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9355699&icde=38525280) to study whole-brain connectomes, and of course there are expected positive effects of this research that apply outside the realm of brain preservation.

  I'm looking for a program I used some years ago. It would give you a question with two options, e.g. "which of these two are the richest" (the options would be picked from a list of he richest people in the world) you would pick one of them, as well as how certain you were in your answer (the options were 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and either 95 or 99%) If you answered correctly you'd get points according to how certain you were, and if you answered incorrectly you would lose points, there were a bigger penalty for answering wrong. I remember there were 0 points for answering 50%

  Have you come across any traditionally-published books that remind you of fanfiction stories?

  The infamous [*Xanth*](https://www.goodreads.com/series/40498) series of Piers Anthony reminds me powerfully of Perfect Lionheart's masterpieces [*Chunin Exam Day*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3929411) and [*Partially Kissed Hero*](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4240771) (endless [Crossing the Line Twice](https://allthetropes.org/wiki/Crosses_the_Line_Twice) combined with fascinating ideas). I also was (less strongly) reminded of Esama's [*Sisyphus*](https://archiveofourown.org/works/1113651) when I read [*Life After Life*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790842) (endless time loops combined with trying too hard to sound deep instead of actually accomplishing anything cool). In both these cases, however, I vastly preferred the fanfiction stories to the original stories.

    Okay, this is /r/rational, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. You're not seriously calling Chunin Exam Day and Partially Kissed Hero masterpieces, right?
    ```

    I loved Chunin Exam Day for so long. It was one of my favourite fics as I read it.

    By the end, I can safely say it's one of the very, *very* few fics that I've left unhelpful, inflammatory comments on (though my youth had a good bit to do with it as well) The concept was well founded, and spawned more than one fanfiction of its own(looking at you *Time Braid* and that Shikamaru one) and was honestly an enjoyable ride for quite a while. 

    Then, at some point, it became a terrible story; the bashing was completely unneeded and over the top, the harem aspects (which my young self loved at the time because 'oh, hot women that the main character gets to bang' was all the rage in my pubescent mind) were completely ridiculous, the power creep (which is honestly one of the funnest parts of groundhog day style stories in this sort of genre; it's almost the entire point of writing one) fell flat because Orochimaru somehow has counter plans on counter plans for literally anything the time looping Naruto tried to do, even though he was hundreds (possibly thousands?) of loops in, and took several opportunities to seduce (females) or torture (males) any of Orochimaru's henchmen for all of the information they had. It would've been one thing if [Spoilers for Time and Again by KyLewin](#s "it was revealed that Orochimaru looped as well, hence his advanced knowledge") but the story went out of its way to make it clear that Orochimaru didn't know and was just that good, despite him being thwarted by much lesser means in canon. 

    It became clear that the author was just trying to justify some reason for Naruto to remain in the loop, even though it was again made explicit that it was Naruto making Chuunin and not Orochimaru losing that was required for that to happen.

    And just to harp on a previous point...the bashing. I'm not going to try and defend Kakashi's teaching style (which is pretty terrible, though consistent with a lot of anime sensei styles) or Sasuke's absolute prickishness but the retribution sought includes, among others, a loop in which Kakashi's dead father came back from the grave and inscribed a seal on his penis that would cause it to explode/fall off if he got an erection that wasn't caused by a woman he married to "break him of his porn addiction and loneliness" and there were several loops in which Sasuke is beaten horribly/killed/crippled for amusement and little else. 

    And the poop humor. God, the fucking cringy poop humor.

    TL DR: I have a lot of issues with PL as a writer, and the story Chunin Exam Day in particular. Calling them masterpieces is an insult to both the words "master" and "piece" and the letters m,a,s,t,e,r,p, i and c.
