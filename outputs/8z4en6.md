## Looking for an Online story

### Post:

The premise is a female paladin is sent to a remote outpost for misfits and renegades to recover from her PTSD after a group if necromancers murder her husband and son in front of her.

The reason Iâ€™m asking here is because the rational aspect of the story is the antagonist necromancers who have(at least on the surface, sensible rational goals that they attempt to achieve in sensible rational ways, including using the settings burgeoning scientific knowledge to use their magic in new and unique ways)
