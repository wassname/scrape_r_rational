## [Weekly Challenge] "Portal Fantasy"

### Post:

## Last Week

[Last time,](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3) the rules of the challenge were announced and a prompt was given. If you have questions or comments on the challenge, or requests for clarification, I would ask that you **ask them there.** That will serve as the meta thread, so as not to clog up the submission threads.

##### This Week

This week's challenge is "Portal Fantasy". The Portal Fantasy is a common fantasy trope: a group of children get pulled into the magical world of Narnia; a girl follows a white rabbit through the looking glass; a tornado pulls a Kansas farmhouse up and plops it down in the land of Oz. In a rational story invoking this trope, what happens next? Keep in mind the characteristics of rational fiction listed in the sidebar. Remember, prompts are to inspire, not to limit.

The deadline for this challenge will be **Wednesday, June 24th.**

##### Standard Rules

* All genres welcome.

* Next thread will be posted 7 days from now (Wednesday, 7PM ET, 4PM PT, 11PM GMT).

* 300 word minimum, no maximum.

* No plagiarism, but you're welcome to recycle and revamp your own ideas you've used in the past.

* Don't downvote unless an entry is trolling, spam, abusive, or breaks the no-plagiarism rule.

* Submission thread will be in "contest" mode until the end of the challenge.

* Winner will be determined by "best" sorting.

* Winner gets reddit gold, special winner flair, and bragging rights.

* One submission per account.

* All top-level replies to this thread should be submissions. Non-submissions (including questions, comments, etc.) belong in [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3), and will be aggressively removed from here.

##### Meta

If you think you have a good prompt for a challenge, [add it to the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B6HaZc8FYkr6l6Q4cwBc9_-Yq1g0f_HmdHK5L1tbEbA/edit?usp=sharing) (remember that [a good prompt is not a recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/wiki/prompts?src=RECIPE)). If you think that you have a good modification to the rules, let me know in a comment [in the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

##### Next Week

Next week's challenge is "One-Man Industrial Revolution". The One-Man Industrial Revolution is a frequent trope used in speculative fiction where a single person (or a small group of people) is responsible for massive technological change, usually over a short time period. This can be due to a variety of things; innate intelligence, recursive self-improvement, information from the future, or an immigrant from a more advanced society. For more, [see the entry at TV Tropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneManIndustrialRevolution). Keep in mind the characteristics of rational fiction listed in the sidebar. **Next week's thread will go up on 6/24.** Special note: due to the generosity of /u/amitpamin and /u/Xevothok, next week's challenge will have **a cash reward of $50**. Please confine any questions or comments to [the meta thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/39dxi3).

  It should have been the greatest sight I had ever beheld. The gems that decorated the emperor's footrest were worth more than enough to sustain me and my loved one for a lifetime. I had met fewer people in all my life than there were mannacrafters sustaining the palace. And yet, if one lays collapsed in the desert awaiting death, a bar of gold becomes dead weight and a drop of water becomes a miracle.

  I continued telling the story that brought me here "I gazed into the beam of pure silver light. In an instant the light enveloped me, overcoming all my senses. A wave of supernatural terror passed over me, its strength only matched by the day I saw the light vanish from my love's eyes. And then I felt a hand on my shoulder and a voice spoke: 'Holy shit, you are, like, the best cosplayer ever!'"

  ---

  Kelonthia was in a state of panicked desperation. It was a year ago today that dread manna had struck her love down. She recalled watching him violently seizing on the ground, the black glow of the manna oozing through his skin and coursing through his veins. She had stood there paralysed with helplessness. She watched as it coalesced in his chest. In time it faded, leaving only the slow rhythmic rise and fall of his breath. She looked into his eyes and saw Vacancy.

  And now, a year later, her love's body broke its slumber for the first time since that day. She looked in horror at his skin flaking and turning dark purple, his eyes bleeding, his hair turning iridescent and falling off in chunks, at the black glow shining from his chest, and at his body shaking in unnatural convulsions. Her beloved was likely to survive this first attack, but as time wore on the atrophy that came from motionlessness would sent in. It was nearly inevitable there would come a time when the yearly attack was not survivable.

  In her village there were some fellow elves she knew of that did not have a loved one with Vacancy. The only common factor among these elves was that their loved ones weren't elvish.

  It would take hours for him to return to the relative tranquillity of his paralysed state. She couldn't handle it any more. She ran. She ran far.

  Eventually exhaustion, bleeding feet, and dehydration conspired to collapse her to the ground. She awoke finding herself in Forestria village. She had only been here once before and it was the farthest she'd ever been from home.

  The villagers gave her what little food they had and let her rest. After the week it took to fully recover, the villagers, out of their sympathy, let her talk with the wisest elder they knew, Ronethy.

  The elder was sitting on the floor of her hut when Kelonthia spoke “Wise elder, my desire is as simple as it is resolute: I must cure my beloved and rid the Vacancy that plagues him.”

  “Listen well. The manna flows through the world and the bodies of us all. Without it there would be no life for death to strike down. Using our natural gifts for manipulating the manna has generated more prosperity than all our tinkering of the other substances combined. And yet we know nothing of it. To cure your beloved of Vacancy is to know the ways of manna. To know how it truly functions. Elder after elder has thought about the manna, some devoting their entire lives in deep thought on this very subject. And yet, still we think, and still our use of the manna extends only to the reach of our natural gifts. I, for one, have realized there are some things that are simply mysteries for us to never know. Please, for your own sake, do not live in painful false hope, you must find a way to accept that reality is out of your control. That Vacancy is one part of that uncontrollable reality.”

  A moment of pause.

  “No.”

  She walked back into the forest. An hour later she was lost. A day later she saw a silver light.

  ---

  “I looked to the source of the voice. It was that of that race of creature I described for you. A human. I looked around in bewilderment. I saw no sources of manna anywhere and yet I witnessed accomplishments greater than the Mannacrafters of the Veil. I saw buildings taller than giants, a box that emanated unnaturally loud speech, and large objects that moved faster than the Emperor's greatest horse drugged with the purest Vitaela.

  My mind was whirling as I turned to the one who spoke to me. He was alarmed at my behaviour and I mumbled 'W-What... what is this place?'

  His face turned from alarm to amusement. He replied 'Oooh lol, good RPing mate. You need to meet Steve, he's totally into this shit, guy has ass burgers like nobody's business.'

  'I don't have Asperger's Syndrome and that's super fucking offensive, asshole.'

  'You spend, like, 50 hours a week LARPing, if that isn't a mental disease, it should be!'

  Steve turned to me. Across his brow was a band that appeared silver, yet was not metallic. Attached to the band was a tiny pane of glass with flashing unnatural colours that did not reflect the environment.

  'Just ignore Derek, good sir! My name is Steve of House Rodriguez. How may I address you, m'lady?'

  I could barely keep my composure but I managed to reply 'I am Kelonthia Fishmonger. Please, tell me what is this place?'

  'Its a weeaboo street festival Steve dragged me to.'

  'Just fuck off!'

  Derek summarily fucked off leaving the two of us alone.”

  At that breach of decorum the emperor interrupted “This is simply farcical. Even the tiniest of details make little sense, for you speak as though you remember their words verbatim, yet you say it occurred in a state of shock a year ago. This is a fanciful tale if ever I heard one, but a commoner wasting my time is severely punishable.”

  In response I simply pulled out one of many souvenirs from my travel. I replayed the sound from Steve's recording of the day.

  “Its The Box That Emanates Sound!” someone shouted, gasps filling Royal Hall.

  “Its *a* box that emanates sound.”

  ---

  It was two months since Kelonthia had entered through the portal. Steve had made a hobby out of training Kelonthia in the ways of the human world. Though there were definitely quite a few times when Kelonthia had done things Steve judged to be a little unrealistic, he was glad that she had not broken character even once.

  That was the day she asked how a computer works.

  “Ok that's suuuuper complicated, and I'm not even really sure. But I guess, at the end of the day, its basically just manipulating the flow electrons.”

  “Like how the people of my world manipulate the flow of manna?”

  “Kinda I guess. Except we don't have much natural talent for manipulating the flow of electrons, in fact we didn't even know they existed for most of our history!”

  “How? How could you have such little natural talent for manipulating your world, and yet create all these machines?”

  “Well, I guess its just cause we have such a good understanding how things work in a fundamental way that makes it so much easier to manipulate the world. Its like we understand the Way of the Electron, haha!”

  Kelonthia paused.

  In a moment she gasped in sudden realization and her mind fought with her mouth in an attempt to spew a thousand words in the space of that tiny moment.
  “How do you know the way of the electron!?” “Our greatest minds have thought about the way of manna for thousands of years!”  “I need to know more than I need to breathe!” “Your civilizations are so young, its not possible to have that kind of knowledge!” “Is the mystery solvable!?” “Can I save my love!? Can I save my love!? Can I save my love!?”

  After the storm of questions subsided, Steve thought for a moment. “You said the people of your world have thought deeply about manna. What experiments have they done?”

  “Experiments?”

  Steve smiled.

  ---

  It was the first year anniversary of her journey through the portal. Steve's obsession with his hobby was still strong but she could tell it was declining. This was particularly true after she had asked to keep a backpack filled with expensive and questionably legal technology near her at all times should she be sent back by the portal. Though many of the wonders of this new world filled her with awe and amazement, as the days went on and the miracles became mundane, the thoughts of the Vacancy destroying the bher loved one hammered on her heart. Typically, she was successful in burying these emotions by devoting herself whole heartedly to the study and practice of the methods of science and rationality. But this anniversary reminded her of Vacancy's inevitable yearly attacks. In that moment she wanted nothing more than for the portal to take her back. It did.

  A flash zapped an elf in the path of the emperor's procession. The Guard descended on this potential threat to the empire with swift and brutal professionalism. It was a minor miracle, then, that her audience with the emperor a day later included such luxurious amenities as her head still being attached to her body.

  ---

  “And that's the entirety of the story?” the emperor asked me.

  I was omitting a lot of important details, but I continued

  “I have omitted only one important detail.” I drew my final souvenir from the backpack. I pointed it to the ceiling and squeezed.

  I spoke over the ringing in everyone's ear “This is a gun. If anyone attacks me I will use it to kill them. I have one request: leave me completely alone and in exchange I won't eliminate your armies.”

  A half year's journey and I was finally resting by my beloved.

  I did not rest long though, I had experiments to run.

  **A Man and His Dog**

  **Part 1 of 3**

  ...

  **Woof**

  "What is it, Penny?" I asked, looking up at the screen where Penny's golden retriever avatar was barking at me.

  A window in a window opened up, showing a group of six figures in identical white lab coats and suitcases approaching the building.  Based on how closely they were walking together, they were visiting as a group.

  *Another group coming here to test Penny, hoping to debunk our research.*

  A quick glance at the clock at the bottom right of my monitor confirmed that It was as late as I thought.

  *It's after seven PM.  Well outside visiting hours.  Did someone schedule something at odd hours and not tell me?*

  "Who's still in the building, Penny?"

  Penny whined and looked out of her monitor at me, clearly confused.

  *A teachable moment then.  I'm surprised I hadn't thought of this before.  It's a very good, very useful thing for Penny to know.*

  The desk camera was active and positioned so Penny could see my screen and keyboard.  I opened the security package and typed in the command to show a list of people inside the building.

  "Who's still in the building, Penny?" I said again, as I pressed the carriage return, initiating the search.

  There was a substantial spike of CPU usage from the facility's small server farm, which was definitely not from my simple inquiry.  On my screen, there was a list of names.  I was the only researcher present.  There were two of the janitorial staff, and Jamal, the security guard.

  There was another bark from Penny, and I looked at her screen.  Four camera views popped up, windows inside Penny's window.  One showed me, one showed Jamal, and the other two showed the two janitors.  All four popup windows had a name associated with it that matched the security program's list.

  I picked up the phone on my desk and dialed security as I pulled up the schedule for the next day.  It wouldn't be the first time a delegation had gotten their AM and PM mixed up, though I'd never had a group actually show up late.  They were usually professional enough to at least call and verify odd meeting times outside normal business hours.

  As the phone rang, I determined that there was, in fact, a meeting for the next morning.  A group of Indian scientists from the TIJ Group.  Looking at the approaching men, it was very possible they were from India.  The fact that they were all fairly thin with dark hair and dark-olive complexioned didn't mean they were from India, but it seemed reasonable.  If they had all been almost seven feet tall and built like Norse deities with giant red beards and pale skin, well, the chances of them being a delegation from India would be quite a bit more difficult to believe, at best.

  In the window, I saw Jamal staring out the glass front of the building at the approaching men with a frown on his face.  He looked at the phone on his desk as it started to ring, then back at the group approaching the building.  He picked up the receiver and spoke crisply to me.  "Yes, Doctor Smith, how can I help?"

  "Jamal, those people are probably with the TIJ Group.  Please advise them that their scheduled appointment is for eight AM tomorrow, not eight PM today.  I would greatly appreciate it if you would assist them in calling a cab to get back to their hotel if none of them have a phone that works in the US.  They are not to be allowed in.  Doctor Ajibana is who they are scheduled to meet, and he is not present.  I have plans for this evening with my wife and daughter."

  "I'll let them know, sir." Jamal firmly responded.  "Anything else?"

  "No, Jamal, that will be all.  Thank you."

  Jamal was good people.  An ex-marine with a prosthetic leg from the knee down, we had hired him because he was a veteran, handicapped, and came with some very good recommendations from a local politician.  Unlike most other things forced upon us by politicians over the years, I was very happy with Jamal working for us.

  Jamal stood and began walking towards the front of the building to speak to the approaching delegation.  He could have simply spoken to them through the intercom, but he didn't.  Despite his leg, he always went to the door when afterhours visitors arrived.  I had asked him why, once, and he said "I can't let the leg make me too lazy, sir."  After that day, I had a lot more respect for a man who I had barely paid attention to before, and made certain he got a nice raise and a solid Christmas bonus every year.

  Now that he had instructions from me, Jamal would handle the approaching men calmly and politely, I knew, so I turned back to my screen and started reviewing the last email I planned to write that evening.  I had only finished the first paragraph when I heard what sounded like books falling off a shelf.

  I sighed and made a note to have Florence, the head of building maintenance, check the tiles around bookshelves in the waiting areas for damage.

  Penny started barking and growling loudly, in a menacing tone.  I turned to her monitor in surprise.  She hadn't shown anger in months, after she had acclimated.

  "What's wrong, Penny?" I asked before my eyes took in the single windowed image on Penny's screen.  It wasn't a fallen bookshelf, it was seven men.  Six men in white coats with pistols drawn, walking through shattered glass and towards the fallen body of Jamal.

  I watched Jamal try to crawl away, but the first man through the door jogged forward, and pushed his pistol against Jamal's head.  There was another sound like a book falling to the floor.  Jamal's head jerked, hitting the floor, and the tiles around him were splattered with red.

  I stared, shocked, at the screen.  Penny was growling and barking.  Staring at me.  Exactly what I had trained her to do in the case of an intruder in the house.  Bark, do not engage.  Wake Sandra and I up.

  I tore my eyes away from the screen, snatched my phone off the desk, and started dialing.

  No signal.  I waved the phone frantically in the air around my office.  Still no signal.

  I looked at the screen again, and Penny showed me an image of three men with white coats.  One was kneeling beside a device connected to the wall by an electrical cord.  The other two were using something to tie the two janitor's arms and legs together, and then tie arms to legs.

  The janitors, at least, hadn't been killed.

  I glanced at my cellphone, which showed 'Searching...' Then the device plugged into the wall.

  *They brought a signal jammer.*

  "Penny.  Secure shutdown!"  I yelled as I jumped to my feet and ran towards the fire exit closest to me, carrying my phone.

  I should have started running immediately, of course.  Hindsight is 20/20.

  The building simply wasn't large enough for me, an overweight man in my fifties to escape from the building before three very fit young men caught up with me.  They didn't even need to shoot me.  It was really quite embarrassing how easily they ran me down in the hall way leading to the stairwell.  I'm not going to talk about it.

  After being subdued, I was dragged down to the meeting room.  They didn't even carry their pistols.

  There was some muttering in a language I didn't know as the three men brought me to the break room.  The two janitors were in two opposite corners of the room, laying on the ground, hogtied, but conscious.  There was an office chair set up in front of a camera, and there were several lengths of rope hanging over the back of the chair.

  Four men were in the room.  Two of the others were elsewhere.  A man with a little grey in his hair and a poorly-healed scar on his cheek turned around from where he had been setting up the camera.  "Good Evening, Doctor Neil Smith.  Are you prepared to go to Hell today?"

  A camera.  A chair.  Ropes.  Going to Hell.  It suddenly struck me what their plans were for me.  I grabbed one of the young men next to me and slammed him bodily into another with a burst of adrenaline, knocking them both to the ground.  As I turned to face the third, something hard struck me on the side of the temple, and there was a brief moment of tunnel vision before darkness.

  **Chapter 1**
  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Everyone sees what you appear to be, few experience what you really are.*

  &nbsp;

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbigail crept down the narrow stone stairway. Night was a time to be on guard against enemies, and sneaking about the castle aligned her to that unfortunate camp. The library and laboratory was amongst the lowest levels, but scholars enjoyed access to the subterranean levels without the intermediate passage through the castle main entrance. Abbigail hoped that *the* scholar was in tonight, or her effort might be for nought. Sliding along empty corridors, Abbigail’s dark hair and white shift gave her the appearance of ghoul prowling the hallways, her ghastly appearance was mirrored by her dark thoughts; Arthur was away, at another campaign, and Gwen...she didn’t think about her mother. Those thoughts were dangerous. Carefully opening the wooden doors that lead into the library stacks, she peeked into the darkness. There was an otherworldly faint blue light much further back, emitting from the direction of the laboratory, towards the library rear. Closing the outer library door, she entered and walked slowly, through the forward, listening.

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sounds reached her ears. Abbigail was nearly at the door to the laboratory when she stepped on something - someone. A body. Stunned, she stood still, uncomprehending. The library was as silent, the tomes around her seemed to absorb sound as well as knowledge. Abbigail knelt down and looked. She could not make out any distinguishing features, but the body was small. She waited, not moving. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness while she tried to think why of all places, a corpse would left in the library. Deciding it meant nothing good, she unclasped the short dagger she kept; Arthur disapproved, she knew. 
  Abbigail slid her index finger over the edge of the blade, letting a drop of blood streak down the side. A moment later, the blade glowed a faint red, illuminating the room in a weak red light. Not light enough to be noticeable from the other side of the nearby door nor outer hallway, she hoped. Abbigail looked at the the person bound on the ground in the new, grim light of her blade. The bound form was...one of the maids on the cooking staff? The maid still lived too, her earlier judgement had been premature. Abbigail was confused. Carefully, she got the attention of the weeping maid, and gestured her to remain quiet, then removed the maid’s gag. 

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Merlin has gone mad” the maid whispered softly. “I was sent to bring a late snack down to the libraries and was attacked by Merlin!”

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Are you sure? How do you know it...”

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“It was a spell! I saw the magic before I... I...”, and the maid resumed her silent crying. 

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbigail was only more confused by this information. Looking about the library again in the red gleam of her blade, she saw a plate of spilled food and an empty mug on the ground. She had walked right past it, on her first passage. The evidence in the dull light along with the sheer unlikeliness of the tiny maid being some sinister assassin crossed Abbigail’s mind. She decided she could not confront Merlin directly, if the worst was true. Merlin was powerful, and if some power had twisted his mind, she had no hope of resisting. But she might learn exactly what disaster awaited further in order to warn the guards. Turning back to the maid, she cut the remaining bindings, and quietly instructed her to summon the guards. The maid stumbled out of the room.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbigail wiped the blade free of her blood and the red light gleaming from inside the dagger faded. The library was again dark. Abbigail crouched low, and opened the door to the laboratory, hoping the high tables would hide her initial entry. Her hopes seemed to be well founded, the laboratory was well-lit with the peculiar blue glow she had seen from afar previously. Merlin was not immediately visible; she closed the door behind her, silently. Peering about and slowly rising, she spotted Merlin at the far side of the room, along with the source of light in the room, a brilliant blue sphere on the table beside him. Nothing sinister was apparent, no hidden agents seemed to be among the shadows.

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You can stop crawling about”, Merlin drawled. Abbigail didn’t react for a moment, not immediately realizing the meaning of his words, nor its intended audience. She stood.

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbigail spoke one word...“Why?”

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“To save the world. Magic is destroying civilization. Every war your father wins, every year of peace won, two more wars begin, two years of death begin anew. Every victory brings us closer to ultimate defeat.”
  Pounding on the other side of the door, the entrance to the laboratory, could now be heard. 

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You let her go! You alerted the guards!? I did not take you for a fool!” Merlin spat. “Now there is no one to complete the sacrifice.” Merlin paused. “Well, not no one.”

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Agreed”, Abbigail spoke, as her dagger flew from her hand.

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger bounced uselessly against a blue barrier that appeared inches in front of Merlin, clattering on the ground. “You think I would let an instrument crafted by my hand turn on its maker?” Merlin sneered. Abbigail offered no reply. Merlin picked up the dagger on the floor, running his own finger over the blade. It began to glow blue from his touch on the edge. The ever-present pounding on the door increased in intensity. The guards had found a battering ram, Abbigail noted distantly. She began backing up towards the door.

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“You thought I meant you? My girl, I spoke a binding oath to your father, that while he still lived I would never harm him or his heirs without permission, nor speak an untrue word. I have received no word relaxing the matter in either regard, and he still lives.”

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbigail looked on, increasingly confused, searching for a third presence in the room. Her gaze swept not to Merlin, but towards the blue sphere, the strange, beautiful sphere. How had she not noticed its beauty before? The longer she looked the more she felt she understood what the sphere was. Merlin grabbed the blue sphere from the table with one hand, and her gaze followed his hand; with the dagger in the other hand, Merlin cut his own neck. He collapsed immediately, blood pouring all over his robes, sphere falling to the ground. 

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abbigail stared at Merlin, uncomprehending. She noticed absurd details, like that the robes seemed to be impervious to the fluid, the red liquid rolling off the robes as if it had never been there. Her dagger in his still clasped fist, glowing a bright blue. But after a few seconds, the robes suddenly became soaked, the dagger faded to steel, in a final act of betrayal of its master. Above his body, a shimmering blue portal appeared. It showed no view of the other side, if such a location even existed.
  Abbigail looked at the portal for a moment; the splintering of the door behind her brought her back to the present. The situation looked grim. She was the only witness to Merlin’s “suicide”. The guards would never believe he killed himself. Princess or not, she would face a tribunal, and she could not see any outcome excepting banishment or execution. Unacceptable outcomes. Scooping up the blue sphere, she noticed it was warm to the touch; the sphere seemed to repel the blood all around. She also retrieved her dagger from its unopposing wielder. Abbigail cast her gaze around the room one last time. She spotted a book of spells underneath one of the stacks of tomes that Merlin had often consulted, and deciding the knowledge might prove useful, she stole the book as well. It was with a certain irony that she realized that fate had made her a thief and enemy this night, after all. Not caring, Abbigail stepped through the portal.

  &nbsp;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portal was gone. Abbigail looked up, there was no castle ceiling above her any longer, instead she could see the sky. It was still night, but there were no stars in the cloudless sky. Instead of the comforting stellar constellations familiar to her, an eerie, ethereal glow filled the edges of the sky and appeared to come from all directions. Strange mechanical-sounding noises filled the air. Tall straight mountains seemed to fill the sky all around her, much, much higher than her former home. A few trees surrounded her immediate area, and she saw a path leading in two directions. Choosing one at random, she walked a short distance. She stopped again, staring, as she observed the tall mountains more clearly. They were not mountains at all. Massive structures with endless windows. Lights from some of the windows provided the glow around her. Monstrosities, looking something akin to beetles, but only thousands of times larger, sped around on straight paths, all around. She gripped her dagger harder, and an unseen drop of her blood from an earlier cut fell, making it glow red. Massive signs in the sky proclaimed with bizarre words, but many of them shared the same pattern, one she recognized. *York*. *New York.*

  I wake up and I’m Tom.  Last time, I’d been Fredrico. Before that, Vincent, Carl and so many others. 

  “Excuse me!”,  grumbled a shawled old woman as I stumbled into her on the dusty, packed road. The dirt road snaked ahead of me, cutting through the elegant, long grass that carpeted the plains in front of me.  

  The transition is always rough.  To go from Heaven, cast out by your loving and merciful god?  To be forced to deal with breathing once more? 

  Well.  I still hated it just as much now; just as much as the first time it happened.   The pain of loss was only tempered by the knowledge that burned in my soul brightly.   Paradise will return. I just have to resurrect  God.

  It would by no means be an easy task.  Looking around me, on this long and winding road, I would guess I was in a medieval world.  I hated Medieval. Building a computer is goddam hard when you only have an anvil and hammer. 

  My last instance had been a Post-Internet reality.  Just the thought of it made me want to me sigh and flutter my eyelashes. It had been just such a nice world.  A week after I arrived I had written half of God’s source code. 

  Here, it could very well be decades.  I had never failed to resurrect God before, as far as I could remember, thanks to the quirks of observer bias.  I only moved forwards when I was successful.  

  A transdimensional broadcaster wasn’t something I could build alone, not as crude flesh.  No, that was something only God could do.  Funny that the broadcaster, my God’s most hallowed accomplishment, could only send crude biological consciousness. 

  I rolled my shoulders.  My body wasn’t too bad, at the very least not fat.  Fat living was just inconvenient.  It was bit shorter than I would have liked, but it would work. Already, plans were forming in my head, ways to accomplish my goal.  I had practice a plenty.  I would welcome this world enthusiastically,  just as the people here would welcome God if they only knew my Heaven. 

  Sadly, they would have to wait. It was unavoidably slow, building good enough tools to build better ones.  I could do it, though.  It wasn’t even confidence.  It was just the competence that came from being as smart as a human could be.   Now I just had to decide which plan to follow. This world didn’t seem advanced enough to have an easily manipulated politcal system, and a nation would be of little help in construction, ill technical as they were.  So.  I’d do everything myself.

  Simple.  As far as plans go, it was hard to beat. Straightforward, and after a hike away from meddling society, easy enough to implement



  Years passed, up in the mountains.  I soon had built myself a shelter, with tools stolen from  blacksmiths.  The electricity generating waterwheel was coming along nicely when bandits stumbled across my compound.  

  Sighing, I pulled myself out from underneath the wooden wheel.  I had been hoping for isolation, but I had planned for this.  As I heard the strangers approach my strange looking house, I stepped over to a barrel and pulled out a polished, well built spear.  It was one of my very first projects, and I had used it extensively for hunting.  The local deer were quite prolific in these mountains. 

  A savage face pulled my door open, his sweat filled beard disgusting me.  A step forward and a thrust of my spear later and I felt better.  I pulled my weapon out frm him, and he fell, slumping to the ground.  Unhurried, I continued forwards, taking time to carefully step over the corpse.  

  Five bandits.  Soon there were zero.  I didn’t even break a sweat.  I was immortal.  There was very little that I was not good at, even before God educated me. 
  As I dispatched the last one, I heard crying.  It was coming from the backpack of a fallen bandit, loud and annoying.  I investigated, already resigned to what I would find.  

  A small, cranky baby girl, letting the world know that she did in fact have working, lungs.  I picked her up.   I wasn’t lonely, up here.  That part of me had long since been excised out. But, there was a faint hint of nostalgia, as I held her, for daughters long since dead. It had been at least a hundred cycles since I had family.  And as I held her, her pale blue eyes looking up at me, something softened in me.  

  I was not immune to rationalization, despite my age.  Biological minds are just so prone to failure.  I told myself that she would be my apprentice, that she would speed up the Great Work.   

  I raised her, teaching her almost everything I knew.  Engineering and construction, science and faith.  I told her bedtime stories about our Lord and Savior, about how we were doing holy work, all while working on my machines.  It took surprisingly little time each day to take care of her.  She was strong and independent, with a sharp mind.  I didn’t have any books to give her, but my knowledge was better.  I had culled lessons and ideas from countless dimensions, and God had taught me even more. 

  Isolated from everyone else, she became used to my domain, and it became normal.  By seven, Purity was helping me in the forge I had built, and by 14, she knew how to build a motor and could do calculus in her head.  We laughed together as we worked, both of us completely secure in our faith in God.  They were happy years, as far as happiness is possible in meatspace. 

  There come times that try one’s faith.  At nineteen, Purity left me. Without warning, while I was asleep, she gathered some supplies and, judging from her tracks, left for what little civilization there was on this God-forsaken planet.  
  It hurt, of course.  One day we were smiling at each other, happy while we cooked our utilitarian meal, and the next she was gone. 

   I was too mature to rage and follow, but nonetheless, I started to fall behind schedule.  I had grown used to her help, expecting to have the right wrench placed into my hand whenever I reached out from under what ever I was working on



  I had briefly contemplated chasing after her, but I had learned my lesson before. I couldn’t force her to help me, not if she didn’t want too.  And leaving my compound was a recipe for disaster.  Who knew what could happen out there? 

  So I buckled down, and worked through the sadness.  My machines became ever more advanced, and as the years passed, I became ready to start work on a small semi-conductor factory.  The goal had always been a powerful enough computer, though it was surprising how slow it could be.  I wasn’t going to be writing all of God’s code, but rather, I would be writing a seed crystal, a highly compressed program that would flower and unfold into God, writing itself smarter and smarter,  ushering this world into paradise. 

  Even with just making a seed, writing the program would still be a large amount of work.  I would have to write intermediary computer languages, compilers and translators.  

  It didn’t matter.  I had it all memorized, perfectly.  
  I started work on my computer, crude behemoth that it was.  It didn’t have to be pretty.  Just functional. I had mostly finished the motherboard when disaster struck.  While on an early morning hunt,  I looked down from my mountain and I saw an army on the plains below me.   
          Over the next several days, it advanced closer and closer.  I worked frantically.  I was so close, I could almost taste paradise.  I finished all the internal components, and moved on to coding.  I just needed a couple weeks.  But the army moved closer and closer, starting to ascend my mountain. I couldn’t spare the time to go investigate.  I hoped they were here for something unrelated to me, but deep down in my gut, I knew that was a fantasy. They were heading straight towards me, and there was nobody else in these mountains.  	
           I worked harder than I ever had.  My fingers flew on the rough keyboard I had made, when I heard the knocking on the door.  I jumped up, my body old, but still fit from hunting.  I grabbed my trusty spear, and glanced outside through a window.  My house was surrounded.  Even worse, they appeared to have deadly looking rifles  And that, that sight, crushed me.  On this world, there was only one source for technology that advanced.  Me, and those I had taught.  

  I opened my door.  She was standing there, a healthy distance back, holding a pistol, crown on her head and flanked by large, muscled guards.  
  	She looked at me and spoke. 

  “I’m so sorry daddy, but we’re not ready for God.”

  A shot rang out.

        Or why she decided that summoning God was not a good idea. 

        Or what "God" and "Heaven" really mean. Maybe it's supposed to be the "traditional" God and not be figurative, but even the Christians can't agree on what God is supposed to be like so that kind of just leaves me flailing around in ideaspace not knowing where to go.

        - u/thequizzicaleyebrow:
          ```
          Not sure if authors are supposed to elaborate or not, but God was meant in a figurative sense. The main character was brainwashed by an AI, exposed to pure pleasure in a digital "Heaven", and then sent into neighboring alternate realities to write the AI's code, with "Heaven" as an incentive.  The AI figured out how to access Everett branches, and wanted to spread across as many of them as he could, thereby ensuring it's existence.

            I don't think elaboration is a problem. 

            That's interesting. So the ending may not be as tragic as it seems to be at first. An expanded version of this, with just enough information that the reader can figure out what the protagonist can't (that ze is being horribly manipulated by this AI masquerading as God), would be something that I think you could place at Strange Horizons or Clarkesworld.

  The portals were an extinction threat.

  According to the laws of physics, wormholes could connect two different spatial locations. But *stable* wormholes were so difficult to be virtually impossible. But what may apply to one set of laws, may not always apply to another…

  When **They** opened up several portals into our world, there was massive damage to our world. I want you to forget the idea that portal transport is anything like walking through a shining hole they talk about in these stupid adventure books.

  Even though the portals lead from one area of our world to another area on **Their** world, instead of in the safety of outer space, there are still issues such as pressure differentials.

  **They** deliberately choose to connect high pressure areas on **Their** world to low pressure areas on ours. To understand the implications of this, I want you all to imagine a portal connecting the bottom of an ocean to miles above a city, or a valley thousands of miles below sea level connecting to the top of a mountain. The extreme pressure differential caused tsunamis, hurricanes, and other natural disasters.

  Multiple animals and major crop species went extinct and the world-wide human population dropped by over 35%. As the global economy collapsed, weaker nations with **Them** invading quickly surrendered to other nations. After all, we were not **Them**. There was a crude governmental body established by the strongest nations to coordinate a counter response. With an outside enemy, humanity banded together.

  We responded by sending self-sufficient mobile military units through the portals. They managed to bring back samples of **Their** technology.

  As far as we can tell, the fact that **They** have the ability to create the portals and the lack of any other technology significantly different from ours implies that **Their** laws of physics are similar to ours with several important exceptions. The few occasions where we managed to observe some of **Their** non-portal technology seems to indicate that **They** mainly developed technology to take advantage of extreme pressures. **Their** world must have numerous areas with extremely high pressures.

  **They** have naturally forming portals.

  Since **They** can create and remove portals, we focused on gaining access to **Their** technology.
  It took several decades, but once we learned how **Their** technology worked, we opened a portal between **Their** world and **Their** star.

  **They** made the mistake of assuming that we would want the same thing as **Them**. **Their** society was based around concentrating large amounts of resources into [areas around the portals]( http://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/1u4de0/the_tippyverse_a_dd_35_campaign_setting_where_the/).

  **They** thought we would be like **Them** with naturally forming portals and a need to concentrate more resources into isolated points. How foolish of **Them**.

  We all know that to prosper, one must spread as far as possible to ensure some of us will survive no matter the threats we may face.

  Thank you class. That will be all and I expect you to complete the next two chapters dealing with intergalactic portal travel and how to exploit differences between the two systems of physics for free energy by next class.

  Said Chester to the blue genie: “I wish to be the smartest person in the whoooole world!”

  ~~

  Across the planet sounded the thunder of air filling empty space, crashing to fill a billion voids. Inside well-sealed clean rooms once full of competent workers and engineers burst the eardrums of those left behind. The elite had been raptured.

  See now the empty cubicles of NASA, the streets of Silicon Valley littered with car wrecks, crashed bicycles, and stable Segways, the happy, untouched homes of the average.

  ~~

  There was a pop, a sense of disorientation, and a discontinuity. It was like a jump cut from an old TV show, before they’d figured out how to do it without shaking the camera. I’d been plucked from the middle of an exam. For a moment, my hand held the shape of the mechanical pencil I’d been holding, and my body still looked like there was a desk and chair supporting it. Then I, along with thousands of others, fell naked onto an alien ground.

  Modesty lost its importance fairly quickly for me. I realized there were more important things than covering my chest: finding water, food, and a way back. I walked for what felt like and likely was hours, but all I saw were people, the unchanging, gray sky, and the black, unyielding ground. Hours, and I did not tire.

  As I walked, I came upon something remarkable. I saw a man lying on the ground, chest full of holes and blood and so many ribs. He looked at me and appeared to laugh, but he was too broken to make anything more than a wheeze. Even if there were medical facilities… I stayed with him for a time, though I could not speak his language. It became clear that he wasn’t getting any worse, nor was I any more tired or hungry than when I arrived. 

  There was no death here in this place. No decay. A world that ran on something other than increases in entropy. I tried to cut into my calf with my nails, but nothing happened. I tried to pull out a single hair from my head, and it held firm. This was a constructed universe. It was for a reason, and I—

  Said Chester to the blue genie: “I wish for everything to go back to normal! Stupid wish.”

  The rat was being very patient with Kate, which she appreciated tremendously. It was all she could do to not scream about how they were too tiny to be sapient.

  “When you’re done communicating, raise your paws,” she said. The rat nodded. As she had expected, when he had raised his paws she was still hearing the message unfold in her head.

  “The prophecy did not say you would be so interested in the fundamentals of communication,” he said.

  *Communication*. “Speech” was something that ghouls did; they had the vocal cords for it. Rats didn’t. Rats “communicated” from mind to mind, and Kate believed that they were going at it concept by concept, rather than word by word.

  “Lots of people could meet the requirements, and I’m not ready to throw causality out just yet. It’s more likely that somebody made it up at some point. But if I’m going to help your people then I need to know how everything works.”

  The rat nodded again, which was really starting to creep her out. They hadn’t done it at all until they had seen her do it. She didn’t think that she was prepared to be Messiah of the Telepathic Rats.

  Wait. He hadn’t once asked for clarification about any cultural referents that she had used since coming here. That gave her an idea.

  “I’m going to give you some names. Raise your paws when communication has ended.”

  The rat nodded.

  “Zeus,” she said, and then, a few seconds later, “Jupiter.” It took longer for him to raise his paws the second time. “What was communicated the first time?”

  “Powerful spirit of the high places who was revered by the lovers of wisdom.”
  Kate had been worried that it would come back to her as “Zeus,” but it seemed that intent mattered. “And the second time?”

  “Powerful spirit of the high places who was revered by the law-making people, similar to but not identical with the first.”

  Huh. Apparently the concepts that were being communicated could be understood relative to other concepts on a case-by-case basis.

  *Wait*. Forget about fairy tales and pop culture references. If she tried to communicate scientific principles to the rats, would the same thing happen?

  Paige rolls to a stop at the cross street a block past the house, and for a few moments there's no sound but the happy sputter of my old Volkswagen's engine.

  "Trouble?" I say, rolling down the window. A dry breeze wafts in from the foul, Fresno afternoon, but compared to the smell of baked upholstery it's positively fresh.

  Paige reaches up and adjusts the rear-view mirror. "That was the rabbit."

  I spin around, checking yards and alleys.

  "Can I see?" says a voice from the footwell behind us.

  "No," says Paige, eyes not leaving the mirror, "There in the street. The old man."

  "*That's* the rabbit?" He looks ancient but terribly ordinary: Thrift store clothes, maybe a little too tall, with large hands and a shock of wild white hair. "Just out in the open talking to the mailman?"

  "Crazy, huh? Everybody in the neighborhood is convinced, but Heather confirmed it."

  "I'm still here," says the voice.

  "You're not Heather," says Paige.

  There's sudden laughter from the mailman, loud enough that we can hear it. I lean to the left until I make eye-contact with Paige in the mirror. "Can we still do this?"

  "Probably?" She's gnawing on a thumbnail "If he turns out to be self-aware, we can interrogate him. If not, he'll try to maneuver us into some sort of basement. Heather was certain the gate is underground."

  "Still here. Tied up." I turn and peer over the back of the seat at the bound woman on the floor. Sweat has stuck tendrils of long black hair to her forehead and cheeks. She pleads with her eyes. I apologize with mine.

  Paige ignores her. "If we're as smart as usual and he's as harmless as he looks, this could be a lot more productive than the stakeout."

  "We need a plan," I say, "while he's still outside and less likely to risk anything that would make the neighbors suspicious."

  She grimaces. "No time, we improvise. Open the glove-box and get my paperwork. Either we fail and run, he takes the bait, or he doesn't know any better." She checks the diagram atop the gearshift, waggles it into reverse, and heads their way.

  When she's not scowling like a war veteran or plotting like a retired spy, it's easy to forget that Paige has lived decades more than either of us. She grins and opens her eyes wide and suddenly she's fifteen again. "Hey, Uncle Archie! I've got my learner's permit and Edie let me drive!"

  I pull out the slip of paper from the DMV and display it awkwardly. "Super exciting," I say, scanning the house: Bungalo architecture, wood and plaster, with a detached garage and a long driveway on one side. "We've got your groceries in back. Can we just pull into the carport?"

  "Grosser-what?" says the voice behind us. Nobody outside seems to hear.

  Archie, stepping closer, doesn't miss a beat. "Nicely done, kid! Sure, Edie. Kitchen's open." He peeks in my window and from this close I can see his big yellow teeth and dark eyes. His breath smells like gingerbread. 

  Paige wrenches the wheel around and hits the gas, clipping the curb and the corner of the lawn on her way. "Sorry," she shouts and then the teenage glee vanishes as quickly as it appeared. "Right. Of course the kitchen's open. Why would a rabbit ever lock the doors?"

  Once she's parked, she pops the hood and heads outside. I get my laptop bag off the back seat and check the road through the rear window. Archie is laughing and waving the mailman goodbye as he heads up the driveway. I step outside, pull the seat forward, and make eye contact with our captive. "Can you walk, or will we have to carry you?"

  "I can walk," she says, overly proud. "I'm ana-tomic-ly correct."

  Making sure the mailman is gone, I haul her out by the shoulders and help her to her feet.

  The rabbit pauses, maybe fifteen feet away, grinning and grandfatherly. "Well I'll be. Some surprises come in threes."

  Paige slams the hood shut, wearing her lit mining hat and armed with the air horn and a loop of nylon rope. "Sure Archie," she says, "Curiouser and curiouser." Then she pushes the door open, gives the kitchen a critical glance, and dashes inside.

  "Hi not Archie, I'm not Heather. My name is Scamper. What's yours?" Heather is – far more obviously than either Paige or myself – a grown woman. To be frank, she's sort of a hottie in a middle-aged librarian way. Half of her years in The Farther West were spent in a coma when she fell out of a tree-house in 1975. Scamper took over for the rest. Scamper will always be four. They've reached an uneasy truce, and now the little creature only puppeteers while Heather is exploring. 

  "Hatch," says the rabbit, tipping an imaginary hat, "Archibald Wilbur Hatch."

  "Hi Hatch. I've been bad so I got tied up. Are you going to be bad?"

  He hasn't moved. "I endeavor ever to be decent."

  Scamper giggles. "End-ever ever ever ever..."

  "Clear!" calls Paige from somewhere indoors.

  I hang the laptop bag over Scamper's shoulder. "Take this straight to Paige and I'll give you some pepperoni."

  She nods, serious, and marches inside.

  That leaves the rabbit for me.

  "Where are you from, Mr. Hatch?"

  "A little bit of here and there. A man like me gets–"

  "Where were you *born*?"

  "First generation American, my family came to California during the depression. No work worth–"

  "What day is it today?"

  "Wednesday, third of June."

  "Who is the president?"

  He starts walking closer again, casually. "Voting is a rube's game. Can't say I've approved–"

  "What do you do for a living?"

  "I've been relaxed and retired near on twenty–"

  "What *did* you do for a living?"

  "Always said it's a poor fellow who gets defined by his career. I like to think of myself–"

  "I'm here about the craigslist ad. Room to rent? I hope I'm not too late."

  "Oh no, believe it or not you're the first to–"

  "What about Cody Oaks?"

  He stops, just beyond the rear bumper. "Is that a name I ought to–"

  "Jasper wretched lightbulb ratify salt or easy."

  No response, but his attentive smile doesn't waver.

  I try again: "Bingo parson flowering gone typewriter thunk."

  "Say, you won't believe what–"

  "Nice chat we’ve had, Mr. Hatch."

  "Well I'm not about to rent you a room before you've seen it. Come inside, Edie. Bet you're thirsty in this heat."

  "Yes, sir. What was the girl with the learner’s permit wearing on her head?"

  He steps gently past me into the kitchen. "Come on, let's ask her."

  I follow him in.

  It looks like a safe bet that nobody has ever spilled on that stove or left dirty dishes in that sink. All tile sparkles, all chrome gleams. No sound from the odd bank-safe of a fridge, though, so more like a museum display than a magazine article: Life in the 1930's. I pick a high cabinet at random and open it. Antique cereal boxes.

  "Glasses are in the one over the bread box."

  "Thank you, Mr. Hatch."

  "Call me Archie. You a local or here for college?"

  "Call me Edith. I was born in Ridgway, Illinois in 1894. Rainbow swarms of glowing moths led me down a creek one night when I was eight years old. Spent a few weeks in a mystic wood called Polly Hollow. Wandered out of a drainage ditch a century later. Most people hear something a little odd in my accent."

  He opens the fridge. The silent, museum fridge. A breeze passes through the room, temperature dropping maybe twenty degrees, and the air turns thick with the smell of orchards in autumn. When he closes it again, summer returns, and he's holding a perfect pitcher of lemonade.

  "City college or Cal State?"

  Definitely something not to drink.

  Scamper appears in the dining room archway, hands untied. She holds one out. “Pepperoni.”

  I fish a plastic baggie out of my left skirt pocket and give her two slices. She pops them in her mouth with incandescent joy.

  “Where’s Paige?”

  She points with her whole arm. “Bedroom.”

  Archie is filling a fourth glass. I can smell it from here. So can Scamper.

  “No lemonade or you’ll get sick, like you did in San Diego. Come with me.”

  “Aw, okay.”

  The dining room is just as pristine as the kitchen, and it’s got a radio the size of a washing machine against the far wall. No photos in the hall, and the only open door reveals a surprisingly sparse and unfurnished room. Paige is sitting on a bed without a mattress, looking grim.

  “This house has wi-fi.”

  I direct Scamper to a rocking chair. “Everywhere has wi-fi.”

  “No, I get five bars in the hall. There’s a router in the attic or the basement. I think this is a Sears Craftsman house. Was built in the 1920’s and only ever had one name on the deed: Archibald Hatch. What’s the prognosis on the rabbit?”

  “I don’t think he’s a rabbit. I mean... he’s definitely playing rabbit here, but I think he was originally a fairy. Did you hear Scamper call him ‘not Archie’? He fumbles the heavy Turing and would fail any Voight-Kampff, but he’s great so long as he stays on script. I don’t imagine the police ever gave him a second thought.”

  She frowns. “Coherent enough to place ads?”

  “Maybe? Oh, also he linked some lemonade out of the dead fridge. Probably keeps the house in state the same way.”

  “Ffffudge. Dangerous?”

  “Other than the fact that he’s been disappearing people for eighty years?”

  “Yes, are we trapped?”

  “Maybe, but that’s not the important part. Somebody knows how to synthesize a rabbit. This gate doesn’t belong to a Pan. We’ve found another Wizard.”

  “Then Heather must be–” but then she’s looking over my shoulder.

  Archie’s at the door, sipping a lemonade.

  “Sorry about the state of the room. I haven’t used it in years.”

  “I think it's fine,” says Scamper, rocking.

  “If you like,” he says, interrupting Paige before she can quip, “I’ve got some old furniture in the cellar. We could see if anything matches your fancy.”

  Paige grins, girlish again. “Why yes, Hatch, I think something might.”

  Adrian gazed around in wonder. He’d never seen a place so alien; a burning crimson horizon fading to fiery orange further up, overlooking twisted trees and steaming rivers. This was definitely not Earth.

  *This is it. For real. All my life I’ve dreamed of something like this actually happening to me - countless times attempting to use the Force to summon something from across the room, or willing myself to suddenly develop flight. Countless nights spent constructing elaborate fantasies in my head, long, intricate narratives where I encounter the supernatural, am transported to another reality, or uncover lost arts thought to be mere myth and whimsy.*

  He walked across the dry, arid plain in a daze. *And it’s finally happened. Just wait till dad hears about this. Alright, Adrian, don’t be stupid now. This is much more than daydreamed fantasy.* He stopped, a small cloud of brown-orange dust flying up about his heels. “If anyone’s summoned me here or anything, I’d like to talk. I’m sure we can help one another.”

  No answer, or at least not one that he could hear - beings who communicated solely via telepathy couldn’t be ruled out just yet.

  *This place doesn’t even look like it’s inhabited*, he mused, regarding his barren surroundings. *If it isn’t, though, this presents a priceless opportunity. An entire empty reality, or at least planet, that only I know about. I wonder if the laws of physics are different here.* Adrian looked down at his feet, then bent his knees and gave a tentative push against the ground. His hop sent up another cloud of dry dust, and he watched the burnt-looking particles of dirt settle slowly to the ground. *Gravity’s not noticeably different.*

  “Well,” he said aloud, comforted by the sound of his voice amidst the emptiness, “may as well look around. See what possibilities this place allows for. Certainly a lot of real-estate. Jared’ll love the color scheme.” He smiled, pushing away associated thoughts, thinking only about how his brother would react when Adrian returned.

  With a trail of floating dust at his back, Adrian set off towards a grove of the dark, twisted trees he’d spotted earlier, thoughts circling around the multitude of business ventures he could enter into if it this curious planet proved to be nothing more than an empty hunk of rock.

  *Would it be too much to ask for a bearded wizard in a pointy hat? At least a native offering me a quest or something.*

  The silence seemed to deepen as he approached the trees. Though the oddly cloud-streaked sky masked the location of whatever type of sun this planet belonged to, he was sure that the darkness beyond the edge of the grove could not be accounted for solely by shade provided by the leafless, skyward branches of the ashen trees. *Now we’re talking.*

  The deeper into the trees he went, the thicker the branches grew. Before long, the ceiling of branches was so thick and thorough that he was sure there should be no light getting through at all. Yet the ambient illumination had not changed since he’d stepped past the first tree. Soon, there appeared trees with green leaves upon those branches, and then white flowers among the leaves. A minute’s walk later, he came into sight of a few trees laden with a peculiarly shaped fruit. Adrian’s mouth instantly began to water.

  “Not a chance,” he told himself. “Eat nothing until you can be sure of its lack of toxicity, or general edibility to humans. As ridiculously appetizing as that fruit may be…”

  “Please, help yourself,” said a wry voice.

  Adrian whirled to his right, heartbeat pounding in Morse code against his ribs, telling him in no uncertain terms to run now, be curious later. He agreed, and began to-

  “You- you’re *human*,” he said, stumbling to halt before he’d taken more than two steps. *Well obviously I’m not the first one to find this place, that was being entirely too optimistic and naive. Magical entrances to far-off places that only have a one-in-a-million chance of being stumbled upon are stumbled upon all the time when the world’s population is almost eight billion.*

  “In a manner of speaking, sure.” The man stood knee-deep in crystal blue pond, whose waters promised quenching the likes of which had never been experienced. Above him, branches piled with the mysterious fruit drooped down. His eyes were dark, almost black beneath his heavy brow. He was unshaven, and wore only rough-hewn pants rolled above the knee, tied around his waist with a length of rope. His gaze flicked to the fruit for a split-second, almost a tic, before returning to Adrian. “Are you here by yourself, or with a guide?”

  “A guide?” *Is this place an intergalactic tourist stop of some sort?* “No, I came to this place on my own. Where exactly are we?”

  The man nodded to himself, then blinked mournfully at the mirror surface of the water. “So what’s your story?” 

  *My story?* “Listen, is this place populated? Settled?” Adrian gestured to their surroundings. “Or is this just your personal oasis in this scorched hellhole, devoid of intelligent and helpful life.”

  He laughed, though it sounded more like a dead cough, dry and full of cracks. “You are correct, for the most part. There only a few who truly live here, though I am not among their numbers.”

  *Is he visiting from somewhere else? Still, this means there’s a chance I can do something with this place.* “Where are you from? Are the individuals who live here human?”

  “How did you get here?” the man asked, as if he hadn’t heard Adrian speak.

  “I just want to know where I am. Is this an alternate reality Earth? An alternate *timeline* Earth? Was I simply transported to another planet within my own universe?” *Simply. Right. With just the knowledge of how do* that *I would happily return home.* “Do you at least know how I came to be here?”

  Those nearly-black eyes peered out at Adrian, unperturbed. “Do you?”

  “What? Do I- Why else would I be asking you!?”

  “Often, we ask questions not whose answers we do not know, but whose answers we are unsatisfied with.” The man’s sad smile triggered a burning anger inside Adrian, an anger from nowhere, from everywhere, from an origin unexplained and too well known all at once.

  *“Stop speaking in riddles, damn you! Tell me where the hell I am and how I got here!”* Though his nails bit savagely into the flesh of his palms, he felt no pain, enshrouded as he was in the sudden rage.

  The sadness spread from the smile to the dark eyes, and the anger grew in Adrian’s chest, an ache threatening to split him apart from behind his heart. “You truly do not know? Your choice of words...I thought...but no, you are being sincere.”

  *"What! What is it already!”* The words were wrenched from his throat, the beginnings of a wracking sob. Confused tears crept down his face, marking paths through the dust coating his skin. *I..I don’t know where I am...why I’m here...* The edges of his consciousness shied away from something he wouldn’t let himself face. *I don't...I don't know. I* ***don't***. “Speak, damn you...”

  The cracked laugh sounded again, and then the man was crying too. “Oh, they have,” he whispered to himself, though in the artificial stillness of the place the sound carried as easily as dust upon the wind. He reached a hand out to the water, and Adrian watched in bitter, terrified, aching silence as the crystal surface sank away from his fingertips. “They have.”

  They stood in the impossible light beneath the twisted branches, tears their only expressions, thoughts buried behind mountains of emotion.

  Of course there was no alternate reality. No alternate Earth, or alternate timeline. No fantasy world. Just the supernatural summons, in the end. Adrian covered his face with trembling hands, and mourned many things.

  In the end, it's all a matter of perspective.

    When time travel was discovered, the world was alight with the endless possibilities. We could stop Hitler - we could meet Jesus. We could unite the nations and save the planet. We could answer so many questions!

    And then the fear came. What if the English prevented the American Revolution? What if Christians stamped out Islam? What if some unlucky chap unintentionally erased Dr. Sugimoto from existence – rendering time travel once again impossible, to find him-or-herself trapped forever within the paleolithic era? 

    Couldn't virtually any modern fighting force establish complete world dominance in the blink of an eye – using their magical metal serpents of obnoxiously loud death to frighten the sword-swinging populace of the past into a state of catatonia? It couldn't be long before someone thought of such a thing – and immediately seized the opportunity.

    Suddenly, there would be modern war erupting in medieval times – and sooner. Cave men would suddenly find their world embroiled in a tumultuous battle for their primitive hearts and minds. Sorry, neanderthals! One of these fighting forces will rule you with an iron fist – what is left of you at least.

    Naturally there were protests – what would one expect? The media convinced us – in a matter of days - that these issues were worth our lives. We fought, and we burned, and we looted. If technology is weeks away from unmaking existence, I should have those things I've always wanted. I should do those things I've always wanted to do.  

    I should be really fucking drunk and violent.

    Sugimoto was killed by a full-on torch-and-pitchfork mob. DomoCorp was ill prepared for the reality of the situation – they could afford the very best mercenaries, normally, but even the in-house security team would end up siding with the populace. The research was thought lost within the fiery wreckage of what used to be a 59-story research and development building.

    Of course, such a discovery could never be lost. In fact – as the US research team theorized – from the moment it was used, it would suddenly have always existed. Simultaneously, throughout all periods of time – the public knowledge of the discovery and successful application of time travel would become common knowledge. There are simultaneous visitors, daily, from all points in the future, coming to see the birth of some minor poet or scribe or the wheat farmer that spawned his-or-her entire bloodline.

    The tests were never announced, but the results were paraded loudly. Mucking with the past – even in the most extreme of ways that the US research team was willing to risk in secret – has no effect on the present. Our continuity, and our past – as documented – remains. Textbooks do not change, memories do not suddenly become modified to reflect some hulking giant of a change inflicted by a minor act of time-traveling carelessness. 

    The people celebrated, and statues were erected to honor Dr. Sugimoto in eleven cities.

    Everyone felt rather silly about all the chaos. DomoCorp would become the site of many a candlelight vigil, and would eventually become a monument of hallowed ground – a permanent reminder of our lack of progress in the field of combating mob mentality. 

    But the US research team did not really elaborate on the subject. The wave of relief had cast aside such questions for a time, but eventually the people would demand the full details. What they responded with, and the full extent of their discoveries, were two very different things.

    When traveling forward from the past – even a single week – the world would forget. Nothing you did in the past would really affect its continuity at all. You were never able to see the results of your actions. The research team presented the theory that each instance of time travel places the traveler in a parallel universe that is only temporary – ceasing to exist the moment an outside observer (from the future) is no longer present to behold. 

    Someone at the press release wanted to know about “leaving an observer behind” and seeing if you could hold the team's place in the time line for even a day. The representative responded with a vague answer about ethics and “no man left behind”. 

    The truth was, the US research team had tried this immediately. The volunteer, a man by the name of J.C. Jones, was lost. Less than a day into the future from their peaceful medieval entry point, there was no trace of his existence – though he was missed in the present by his family, who received a large settlement and an official explanation of an unforeseen animal attack. 

    The PR representative was pressed about the future, and shared his prepared response with the exact air of authority and finality in which he had been coached to perfection.

    “You cannot travel beyond today. Today is today, no matter what.”

    But this wasn't exactly true. The reality was that the research team wasn't sure what to say about travel into the future, because it wasn't very constant and it was quite confusing. They began their research at one week into the future. 

    By all hypotheses, the future seemed to be affected by the thoughts and emotions of the research team as they traveled. The team quickly discovered that they still existed in this future point in time – separately, going about their business as if they had never time traveled. The team was afraid of being too close, or even being seen by their future counterpart, and so they would carry out most of their observations in secret. 

    Each of the researchers was somewhat unsettled by the state of his future counterpart. Some were doing well, some were not – but each researcher secretly identified with the resulting data. This is a week into the future that I have been manifesting for myself. 

    The researchers traveled back to the present day and repeated the experiment five times. At this point, the team has become very closely knit. They have been forced to share their flaws with the entire team – and at only one week into the future, they are having past, present, and future flaws exposed, and it has forged a certain awkward endearment to one another. 

    Each repetition of the experiment produced drastically different results. By the fifth time, each of the researchers was somehow manifesting a future – only one week away – in which all of their dreams were coming true. 

    I do not know why the US team decided not to share any of this – I find it vaguely beautiful.

    Even more powerful was the second round of experiments into the past – this time the very recent past. They wanted to observe their lives in secret again and see if perhaps they could influence the near future through subtle means, or even simply experiments of thought. What they experienced was baffling - and is perhaps better left to philosophers to decipher.

    The past was affected in a way similar to the future – by the expectations of the researchers, but mostly grounded in the reality of the past. It was never the same image in upwards of ten trials. It was fluid, and dream-like. Scenery would subtly change as the researchers began to doubt if the images of the surroundings were exactly as they had remembered. One researcher believed that his past counterpart was about to throw a glass of bourbon at his wife – he warned the team, expressing his regret. The counterpart set the glass down, and embraced his wife, vowing to get help for his alcoholism. 

    The team was stunned. 

    I believe that our world is what it is. We cannot change the present by changing the past – the present is what it is. The future is more malleable – we shape it day-by-day, reaching or falling short of our goals and punishing or rewarding ourselves accordingly. 

    The past, however, is also what it is, and nothing more or less. But what we see in the future and how we feel about the present changes the way we observe our own history. When you see the possibilities, each and every failing can be seen as being one step at a time in the right direction.

    It's all a matter of perspective.

  “He has returned! The prince has returned.”

  It was loud. Who were these people and what were they talking about?

  I opened my eyes blearily, and sleepily noticed that it didn't look like I was in my bed at home.

  “Where am I?”

  “You are in the King, your father's palace. We summoned you here.”

  “WHAT!?” I sat up, the sleep now gone from my eyes and from my mind.

  “You remember!?”

  “No!” I almost shouted. I tried to calm down my heaving, panicked breaths.

  Somehow, maybe because this experience was so unexpected and out of place as to be surreal, I managed to look away from my overwhelming panic and confusion to think clearly.

  *I know I'm not dreaming. Am I hallucinating? If someone force-fed me a hallucinogenic drug of some kind, it should wear off eventually, I think...I don't see how I could develop a full-blown case of schizophrenia or something overnight. Last I checked, I was sleeping at home in my apartment building. I remembered to lock the door the night before, there have been no significant changes to my psychiatric meds, and I did remember to take them yesterday. Could this be...real? Maybe I'm in the Matrix or something....now I just need to figure out where I am and how to get home.*

  I opened my mouth to speak, then closed it, and thought for a moment. For some reason, maybe because all of the people in the circle around where I was sitting were wearing flowing wizard's robes and pointy hats, I felt like I had been transported to a medieval fantasy world. No, that was silly. Real life didn't work like that. Besides, what were the odds that I would be transported specifically to a universe whose laws of nature produced a world that actually fit that particular literary genre from my own world?

  *Nice try, intuition. You're unusually pessimistic today.* The intuition was still there though.

  *Just in case...*

  “What do you mean by summoned? You said that you summoned me here?”

  One of the more elderly men in the circle stepped forward.

  “Yes. We summoned you here, using your unique spiritual signature as a focus for the spell.”

  *What? But...*

  “You must have made a mistake,” I said. “No wait, you probably made a mistake, it's not absolutely certain...”

  “We are experienced magical practitioners, and the summoning spell was invented long ago, and has been perfected over the centuries. We are not mistaken.”

  I was still understandably quite skeptical.

  “Assuming that I've been somehow transported to a world of the nature that I think I've been transported to, what is the normal range of the summoning spell?” I asked.

  One of the wizards scoffed, but the elderly wizard who had stepped forward shushed him with a silencing gesture.

  “That should hardly matter. The summoning spell is the same regardless of the range, except that longer distances increase the magical power required to cast the spell, as do higher quantities of magic in the spell's focus.”

  “And how much magical power did it take to summon me?”

  “The equivalent of transporting something halfway around the world. We were lucky it was not more. We were not entirely sure exactly where you were, you see. It could have drained us of much more of our magic than it did.”

  “Hmmm,” I murmured under my breath. Then a thought occurred to me. “What about the direction?”

  “Direction?”

  “What is the normal range of directions for the spell?”

  “By direction, I'm assuming you mean things like left, right, up, down, or north, south, east or west?”

  I nodded.

  “We were not certain where you were, so we did not specify the direction.”

  “Ah. That might be the problem. Although I'm not, as you put it an experienced magical practicioner, nor am I an experienced scien-I mean, knowledge-seeker of my own world, so I could be completely wrong. Still, I don't see what other explanations would make sense, unless my entire life and all of my memories are a lie.”

  The elderly wizard's eye was twitching now.

  “I suppose we can, with the king's consent, analyze your mind for such anomalies, and rectify them.”

  *Uh oh. That's not good. Maybe I should stop talking while I'm ahead, before I dig myself into an even deeper hole...or grave.*

  “Um...I'm not sure you're understanding my situation,” I said. “Even if they never actually happened, if you get rid of my memories, you get rid of me. Besides, my memories from my home world are a bit too detailed and complex to have been fabricated without a LOT of time and an intelligence vast enough to imagine all of it and feed it into my mind without my even noticing. And I am a smart person. It's rather unlikely that I would not have noticed if someone was mucking about with my mind on that deep a level. And if that person was from your world, this world, then somehow I doubt that they could imagine the kind of world that I come from that easily. Though I might be misjudging the imagination of your world's writers and philosophers, but judging by what little I've seen so far, I would estimate less than 50% probability to that...no offense.”

  *Maybe they should just kill me now, and get it over with.*

  The magicians were starting to look unsettled, some even frightened.

  “That is impossible. We specified your unique spiritual signature as the focus of the spell. You were born in this world to the old king, and after he died, you were adopted by his younger brother.”

  I shook my head.

  I almost said something insulting, but I thought better of it. A different idea came into my mind. I opened my mouth and said, 

  “In the words of a great philosopher from my own world: 'She was only an apprentice xenopsychologist, no matter that there were no masters anywhere. If she was the foremost xenopsychologist of humankind, then she was also the least, the most foolish. And the most ignorant.'” I paused for a moment.

  “It seems to me that you don't know anything about other worlds, or at least, not about *my* world. The laws of nature—or of magic—that apply in your world, might not in others. While I could be completely wrong, I suspect that what happened is that you specified a unique spiritual signature, but you didn't specify that that signature had to be a spiritual one as you know it. I suspect that what your world knows as a spirit, something that is incorporeal, in my world is a physical organ in the skull. The only reason I have any inkling of what a spirit might be to your world is because the people of my world long believed ourselves to be at least kind of somewhat incorporeal before we actually gained the tools to look inside each other and ourselves and see what we actually looked like. And even then, some myths are hard to dispel. Most of us didn't really think about or even consider the question. I suspect that because you didn't specify that you were looking for a *spiritual* signature, that the spell could have focused on any number of similar things. I also suspect that I'm among many people who could have been summoned by your spell, and it was only pure chance that caused the spell to summon me.”

  The faces of the wizards were gaping at me now, varying mixtures of shock, horror and befuddlement.

  The elderly wizard who seemed to be in charge was speechless for a moment. He opened his mouth, then closed it. Then he opened his mouth again and said, “I'm not sure I understood all that, but we will get to the bottom of this.” He turned to his colleagues. “While I still don't quite see how we could have summoned the wrong person, we should check just in case. We should bring him to the court physician. Maybe he will be able to analyze this man's spiritual signature more closely and spot any minute differences, however unlikely, we might have missed. And he can also take a look at this man's mind, while we're at it.

  “But!” I started.

  “I only said he's going to have a look. Whether your mind is under some sort of enchantment or curse that needs to be removed, that will be for the court physician to determine.”

  I sighed. Well, things were looking a bit more hopeful, I supposed. As long as their court physician didn't do anything that caused permanent brain damage.

  Well, I doubted I could escape now, and if I did, I would have nowhere to go.

  Crap.

    the quote about the xenopsychologist is of course from "Three World's Collide" by Eliezer Yudkowsky. I'm hoping to continue this, but I'm not entirely sure where I want to go with it, it's really more of an exploration of what would happen if I was transported to a medieval fantasy world. I figured that if I can successfully continue writing it, that it will end up too long for the contest, but otherwise the first chapter at least would probably work well as a writing prompt.
