## A question about rationalist fiction

### Post:

I’ve recently started reading HPMOR and have greatly enjoyed it so far however I’ve noticed something that concerns me. When Harry was confronted with the possibility of souls he argued against it and was ultimately proven right. This is very concerning to me as Harry was clearly a firm transhumanist and believed against ageing so when he found something that went against his worldview he rebelled against it and was proven right. What if he wasn’t? What if souls had been objectively real? Would Harry have still been able to alter his beliefs to accept them? Based on his reaction to everything else in the wizarding world I do not think he could have and this concerns me as it goes a key part of the scientists mindset being open-minded as you must accept evidence that goes against pre-conceived notions even if you strongly dislike what you have learned. It has impacted my ability to enjoy the fanfic as i am always wondering what would happen if one of his conclusions was proven wrong.

  He literally spent most of the first ~10 chapters changing his mind about loads of stuff he thought impossible despite his initial disbelief.

  If the evidence from his experiments showed otherwise he would've changed his mind about this, too like he does numerous times in the story.

  I'm not sure what makes you think harry's disbelief in souls is not rational given what happens in the story:

  1: Brain damage exists and removes peoples' capabilities just like it does in reality.

  2: Ghosts are not full entities like living people are

  3: the resurrection stone brings back people that are somehow 'shadows' or also not real entities like living people are.

  4: the veil seems to give incoherent whispers of something that seems like the dead.

  So it seems like everything that might initially point to some kind of immortal soul doesn't really add up to that, so there really isn't any good evidence for immortal souls, so why believe it?

    Yeah the main problem is that souls just don't work, conceptually. You can't have both "every human has some eternal, unchangeable essence" in the same universe as "humans grow and change" and "chemicals affect behavior". 

    Since we obviously live in the latter universe, you end up having to compromise on the former statement, _hard_. At which point you're no longer talking about "souls", but rather something like a mind-scan or a personality initialization vector.
    ```

    - u/Lethalmud:
      ```
      Nothing about souls say there unchangeable.
      ```

      - u/IICVX:
        ```
        so then what's the difference between a soul and a mind scan?
        ```

        - u/steelong:
          ```
          Mother of Learning seems to do a good jobs with the explanation for souls existing.  Along with some other stuff, souls kind of act as records of a person's existence.  They store information about every state the mind and body had been in since birth.  Souls don't actually do any thinking on their own, they need some 'container' like a brain made of meat or magic to do it for them.

          If you suffer brain damage, that damage is reflected in the soul.  But since the soul stores all past states as well, it could theoretically be used as a template to restore the person or even resurrect them if they die.  Problem is no mortal is that good at soul manipulation.

          Souls can be observed and measured, and are known to fade away soon after a person dies.  Major religions claim the souls are passing on to some kind of afterlife, and even the more cynical of soul mages seem to think that those souls go *somewhere* and aren't just destroyed, but nobody has observed that afterlife directly.
          ```

          - u/IICVX:
            ```
            I mean that's a cool definition of "soul", which is rational and coherent.

            It's also entirely at odds with the [Judeo-Christian definition of the term,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soul#Christianity) which is what rational!Harry would have been thinking of when someone tells him "souls are real".
            ```

            - u/steelong:
              ```
              Sure, but he didn't really ask what Dumbledore meant by "soul" as far as I remember.  Not that this version of souls exists in HPMoR or anything.  I wasn't trying to argue for souls, just that a coherent definition for an unchanging soul can exist.
              ```

              - u/IICVX:
                ```
                And my point is that attempts to make the definition of "soul" coherent inevitably make it diverge irreconcilably from the layman's understanding of the term.
                ```

                - u/None:
                  ```
                  In my experience the layman's understanding of the term 'soul' is just 'me, but immortal and not requiring a body'. 

                  Nothing about that particularly seems to be explicitly disproven by any of the evidence I've seen hear. People change and grow all the time. I don't think many Christians expect to go to Heaven and then literally remain exactly the same person for eternity because souls are 'unchanging'. The 'chemicals affect behavior' argument is pretty much dealt with the same way; I don't think many casual Christians believe they won't be able to get drunk in Heaven. This is anecdotal, but to almost everyone I've met, the 'eternal' part of the soul is far, far more important than anything about it being 'unchanging'. To the layman, I'd argue, the soul basically is just a mind-scan; only most people believe that they are the 'mind-scan', temporarily inhabiting a body, and not a 'brain that will be mind-scanned upon death'.

                  This conception of the soul, I think, would fit pretty nicely in the HPMOR universe. Just say that brain damage can change behavior because the soul is more indestructible than unchangeable, and what happens to be body/mind can affect it (boom! mind magic just became even more terrifying). Make Dementor's an even greater evil to defeat, because they literally eat your soul. 

                  Honestly I was really, really surprised that didn't come up in the story. Harry spends a lot of time outraged at dementors, and yet he never thinks to himself: "Wait, people around here seem to think dementors suck out your soul; and yet the Dementor's Kiss is how we execute people? The government thinks that having your immortal soul eaten by a death demon is a suitable punishment, for anyone? What the hell?!?" The use of dementors in the Wizarding Government in canon becomes even more horrifying, once you take into account the presumable beliefs of the people employing them, and I'm surprised that never really got mentioned (that I can remember).

      >You can't have both "every human has some eternal, unchangeable essence" in the same universe as "humans grow and change" and "chemicals affect behavior".

      Of course you can. Souls can just be riding the meat-bag bodies and interfacing with the brain. If the interface gets messed with substances, riding gets harder, thus chemicals affect behavior. Same as getting your head bashed doesn't affect the soul, just the brain and breaks the interface.

      Growing up, your interface becomes more usable etc, it changes. Soul might also not immediately know how to use it well.

- u/biopudin:
  ```
  at the end of HPMOR Harry realizes the extremely low standars of his rationality. His initial reaction about souls is mostly emotional but comprehensible, which in the end is proven right.
  But still, many of the things that Harry does end up being flaws in his reasoning that he doesn't notice because he argues himself into doing it. That's one of the lessons of HPMOR, just because you know about biases and rationality doesn't mean that you will actually reason better, you must do an actual effort to detach yourself from the instinctive biases and flinches.
  In the AN of chapter 1 reads "Not everything the protagonist does is a lesson in wisdom"

- u/ArgentStonecutter:
  ```
  1. Harry's conclusions do get proven wrong. Others that don't fail to survive deeper analysis. Harry isn't perfect and HPMoR isn't perfect either. That's life. It is what it is. C'est la vie. Que sera sera. Etc.

  2. [Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Zombie](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10023949/1/Harry-Potter-and-the-Philosopher-s-Zombie).
  ```

- u/Sonderjye:
  ```
  It's been a while since I read HPMOR but if I remember it correctly Harry conducted a few experiment before concluding that souls actually wasn't right. If memory serves right he checked if ghost could still learn new skills and there's only room to do so many experiments in a book before it gets tedious.

  As it was I think that the lesson was that even if you saw something that seemed to have an obvious explanation you should still explore alternative hypothesis.

  If Harry drew the wrong conclusion and later were proved wrong it would have been a story about motivated/biased reasoning which could also have been valuable. As so far as whether Harry would have realized the truth in this case I don't know but ultimately it would have been fine for me to have the protagonist make such a mistake.

  The story relevant thing harry gets wrong for most of the story is his belief that >!voldemort was stupid!< which bites him in the ass.

  Regarding death, harry says that his initial reaction was of excitement, that he'd get to see his grandparents again, but he is only let down. 

  He asks dumbledore directly, but dumbledore gives him nothing. 

  He asks quirrell, who he trusts to be reasonable, and quirrell says he looked into it and found nothing. 

  What would you have harry do? Nobody's given him anything he can falsify. Well, there actually are two things he could try. He could check out the veil, but he doesn't have access, or he could check out the resurrection stone, which he doesn't have (but does inquire to quirrell about finding).


  I'll end with a question,  how absurd does an opposition have to be before a rationalist gets a pass for not taking them seriously?

    > The story relevant thing harry gets wrong for most of the story is his belief that voldemort was stupid which bites him in the ass.

    And it's actually just that there was another layer behind it. Voldemort *was* stupid. But Voldemort was just a character played by a much smarter mastermind, simply for kicks.

      ```
      >!In chapter 86, Harry continues to dismiss voldemort's intelligence in spite of evidence to the contrary. Dumbledore and Snape explain that there was much more to the dark mark than initially appeared, but Harry is obstinate in spite of the fact that he "fell for" the Dark Mark's trap exactly as was intended and had this explained to him.!<

      >!Failing to ask, "maybe voldemort actually had a reason for acting the way he did" was a mistake. Saying that he was right because "voldemort was just a mask and Harry's claim was that voldemort was stupid, not the person behind the mask" is just a cop-out. (I don't think Harry, after realizing how wrong he was, would disagree with me.)!<

      >!("Ah, I was wrong, but actually, I was right, it's just that there was another element that I didn't have in my model!" Well yeah bro, but you're still wrong.)!<
      ```

      - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
        ```
        Yeah, I agree with that. I just meant his mistake was simply to have stopped at the first level (Voldemort acting stupid) rather than moving past that (Voldemort acted stupid *on purpose* and actually had a deeper reason for it).
        ```

        - u/kaukamieli:
          ```
          Well, he thought V was stupid because V did stupid things. Was there some reason he should have thought otherwise?

          - u/SimoneNonvelodico:
            ```
            I think the general idea is there were subtle telling signs - mostly, that for someone so blatantly stupid, he still had a worrying degree of success. Dumbledore and Snape weren’t idiots, and both vouched for Voldemort’s cunning. Then again, the whole “Voldemort is stupid” thing mainly started to lampoon the canon, where Voldemort (and everyone else) do indeed seem stupid. Of course there needed to be a twist on that.

            - u/kaukamieli:

    This is the real problem: Rationalists typically do not have very good communication skills. They do not understand the hearts and minds of outsiders well enough to interface their own hearts and minds with those of outsiders. They do not know how to explain their ideas and concepts in terms outsiders will understand and be able to follow. And when someone cannot explain something to you in your own language, that information fails to be transmitted, and then all you can hear are words which don't mean anything to you. When a bunch of people start making a bunch of random wrong claims about you, your community, your culture and your beliefs, going through each and every wrong claim individually one by one is the wrong way to do things because that doesn't give anyone the full picture of how your counterarguments fit together and requires readers to read a huge wall of text before they can understand you and what you're saying.

    No, you do not get a pass on taking the concerns of other human beings seriously. If you do not take them seriously they will definitely not take you seriously.
    ```

    - u/causalchain:
      ```
      While I agree with your assessment, I feel like "Rationalists typically do not have very good communication skills" is misleading. Nothing about rationalism would worsen someone's communication skills, rather, a large demographic both have poor communication skills and are attracted to rationality, biasing the sample.

      I think a more precise way of phrasing it: Most rationalists do not spend enough effort to improve their communication skills.

  Giving HPMOR a fair shake means being exactly as skeptical of all of Yudkowsky's beliefs being right in the story as you were when Rowling canonized souls and the afterlife. (Or any other author, really.) I can get not agreeing, but think about it this way - I have read hundreds, maybe thousands of books, all written by people devout enough to endorse souls in one form or another. I'm willing to let Eliezer prattle on about timeless physics or whatever he believes to be true so long as the story is intelligent and self-consistent.

  When Harry discusses the matter of an afterlife with Dumbledore, he basically *pleads* him to give him compelling evidence. This is obviously an emotionally charged issue for him (as would be, I suspect, for all of us, rationality be damned). If immortal souls exist and an afterlife is there, then death is much less of a big deal. Of course, having met magic and seen ghosts if anything his hopes about that were raised - and then crushed, when he realised that ghosts were just mental afterimages and wizards really didn't know all that much about the afterlife. I think Harry's position is pretty understandable - he'd like to believe in souls and life after death, and hence is all that much more suspicious of himself and puts any ideas in that direction under rigorous scrutiny. Because it's the one thing where he knows he could fall prey of wishful thinking, and doesn't want to.
  ```

- u/crivtox:
  ```
  Well first souls are a pretty vague concept and could mean lots of different things whith completely different consecuences.

  Also of course if there were obiously souls Harry would believe in them, it's just that he feels very strongly about it and doesn't really want to be disappointed again, so hes not likely to seriously research it. 

  But I don't think it's that likely that he'll be proven wrong . 
  Something that works as hardware for human minds  but somehow let's their brains work like normal seems really complicated . 
  Something that stores copies of people's minds is more likely, but then if you get brain damage(or re eaten by dementors) it will also copy that so it doesn't imply a nice afterlife for everyone. 

  I'f he found wizards don't get brain damage or something like that sure. 

  But the only evidence we have of anything soullike are animagus being able to think as cats or whatever, but that might be an special effect that works while you are transformed  and not something general(after all while you are transformed your brain is not working at the same time) . 


  And even if there are souls, an afterlife is even more unlikely. 

  Of course Harry should seriously research this at some point , but asking quirrel is a decent experiment for now.
  He  shouldn't just abandon the idea , but it's understandable that he feels really emotional about it, and it's not something he's likely to make much progress on right now. 

  So while it is an error to not research souls and posible afterlife more carefully it's not that big of an error.

  Of course  reality isn't fair, maybe that small error has really big consecuences, like if there's a nice afterlife and people that don't instantly die whith all their mental faculties intact get there whith brain damage. 
  In wich case Harry might be wasting his time when he should be destroying the world  to ensure everyone goes to the afterlife. 

  But well I guess he'll get arround researching it once he gets smarter.

  Harry is an obvious author-insert.  The author, Eliezer Yudkowsky, has been known to make posts like, "don't let your political biases blind you" (paraphrasing), while also making posts like, "Trump being president will lead to the end of the world." (Also paraphrasing.)

  Also, Eliezer posted on this subreddit, asking if there were any actual mistakes with the science he wrote.  A lot of people responded with [scientific mistakes that were made](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2zd3x7/actual_science_flaws_in_hpmor/?st=juxvj10m&sh=6ef7c88f), but Eliezer only responded to one of them with, "This looks like an actual science error. Thank you! I will look into it and see about fixing it." with the implication that all those other comments weren't actually science errors.

  I guess what I'm saying is, it's not a problem with Harry.  It's a problem with Eliezer.

      Regarding the apocalypse thing: it wasn't that one. I posted about it with the exact link elsewhere, but I'm on mobile right now, so I'll see if I can find the post in question later today.

      For the rest of it, I just saw the post about su's sockpuppeting that Makin linked. If true (and I have no reason to suspect it's not), that shows two things: one, that Su is guilty of making up personal anecdotes and friends with degrees that support his position. And two: when it comes to the actual science, his posts are reasonably accurate, at least as far as that poster could tell.

      I understand you dislike Su because of his inappropriate behavior, and I don't blame you at all for that, but you and Makin seem to be letting that dislike affect your judgement.

      Even if people are just "parroting back what su said", there's nothing wrong with that if the criticisms are accurate. Some of them, I'll admit, are outside my knowledge, but others are easily verifiable (robbers cave), and others are really just common sense (harry making the n-rays mistake himself).

    Almost all the "science errors" that people discuss regarding HPMOR were "discovered" by su3su2u1, who was found (I think by slatestarcodex?) to have faked his credentials, IIRC he claimed to have two PhDs in fields he hadn't even studied. He turned out to be a weirdo compulsive liar with an axe to grind.

    I don't think HPMOR's science can be 100% correct considering EY is just a self-studied AI scientist, and there are some real reasons to criticize him, but it annoys me that people keep using that guy as evidence and have stopped doing their own research.
    ```

    - u/abcd_z:
      ```
      Regardless of the author's standing, the criticisms of Eliezer's science that I can easily verify seem pretty spot-on.  For example, Robber's Cave did in fact have three parts, not two.
      ```

      - u/Makin-:
        ```
        I'm just saying he shouldn't be linked as a source because he's inherently untrustworthy, not that all his criticisms are wrong. He is indeed correct about the easily verifiable stuff, but I don't think we should take the rest at face value considering what he did. Besides, do we really want to encourage that kind of person?

        I guess we're getting way off topic here, considering the neuroscience mistake wasn't even su3su2u1. Probably shouldn't have brought it up, but the "Eliezer only responded to one of them" was just so misleading.

          If the claims are true (and I have no reason to believe otherwise) it looks like the author is saying two things: first, Su is guilty of making up anecdotes and friends to support his positions. And second, at least on the science that the author was familiar with, Su was reasonably accurate.

          Given this, I can't help but think you're letting your dislike of Su affect your judgement.
