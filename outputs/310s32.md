## [MK] If you could choose between shopping on line today at today’s prices, or buying from a mail order catalog of the past at past prices but with your present disposable income, what items, if any, would you buy from the past?

### Post:

Here's an interesting thought experiment I just came across.



>**The catalog price crosscheck.**


>To get an idea of the accuracy of the CPI for goods that do
undergo significant quality changes, we can turn to another source of historical price
information: old mail order catalogs. Full reproductions of historical catalogs from Sears,
Wards, and other retailers are available online at wishbookweb.com . In a post I wrote a couple
of years ago, I proposed this simple thought experiment: If you could choose between
shopping on line today at today’s prices, or buying from a mail order catalog of the past at
past prices but with your present disposable income, what items, if any, would you buy from
the past?


>For example, would you buy a 25 inch color television from the 1981 Wards Christmas Catalog
(p. 344) at $688.88, or would you buy the Samsung 28 inch LED model that I found on
Amazon for $219? Based on the 1981 price, ShadowStats would predict that a 25 inch TV
should cost $7,712 today, whereas the CPI would predict that it should cost a mere $1,794.
Both indexes wildly overstate TV price inflation even without allowing for quality changes, but
the CPI does not miss by nearly as much.


>Maybe it is unfair to use something high-tech like a TV, so let’s go low tech. How about a pair
of ladies leather gloves, item A on p. 85 of the 1981 Ward’s catalog, for $13. Compare them to
a pair I found on Amazon for $10.70.

This might be an interesting system for a story. One advantage: you don't have recourse to ill-defined magical powers. The system is grounded in the realm of the known which might appeal to folks who prefer less fantastical stories.



Addendum: Assume you can buy a fixed value of goods from Sears each day. No immediate access to infinite money if you spot an arbitrage opportunity.

  1937 Sears Christmas Book.
  90% cotton, 10% wool full body long underwear.
  $2.49 per three suits ($0.83 each).

  From Amazon: [here](http://www.amazon.com/Indera-Mills-Classic-Union-865us/dp/B000V5CQKG/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1427874009&sr=8-6&keywords=long+underwear+cotton+men+suit)
  100% cotton full body long underwear.
  $18.70 minimum per each.

  I will happily take the arbitrage from buying $0.83 full body long underwear suits and reselling them for $18.70.  2253% gross return is rather more than acceptable.

    Interesting /u/farmerbob1. I can honestly say that cotton underwear never crossed my mind. 


    One point. I think we should restrict ourselves to the 1985 catalogue else the difference in price due to inflation becomes too large even accounting for quality changes.

      Without doing a real dig through the catalogs, I'd probably turn my head towards gold jewelry next.  Gold prices in 1985 were around 317 dollars US per ounce.  Right now they are at 1200 or so dollars per ounce.  Clearly 14kt jewelry wouldn't be the best way to take advantage of the arbitrage in gold values, but the Sears 1985 catalog indicates that their jewelry is 14kt.

      A jeweler that knows the jargon for gold jewelry, and knows what is selling well right now, could probably turn a tidy profit.  Some jewelry styles are timeless.  If I wanted to do it entirely by myself, I'd have to spend some time learning about jewelry.

      EDIT Also note that there are a HUGE number of shops that will buy jewelry directly, with few questions asked.  You could conceivably make a substantial profit doing this and never be noticed.

  Leather boots from Sears seem to have gone up by a factor of three or more since 1985. Other durable clothing (jackets, coats) seem to have a similar ratio. The problem with 1985 is that inflation has been unusually low since then, with post-Reagan policies holding it low and increasing inequality instead (inflation is good for equality because it targets money capital).

    ```
    I think the lack of large arbitrage is a feature not a flaw. It alows you to tackle the problem of "What's the best thing to do with an extra $10-$20 per day?"


    Optimisation done small.
