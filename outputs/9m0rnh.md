  From the author of [A Voice Across The Void](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10740793/1/A-Voice-Across-the-Void), an excellent Star Wars fic I discovered just yesterday in the monthly recommendation thread.

    Oh, hey.  Speaking of A Voice Across The Void, did you manage to figure out who the person in the holocron was?  Identifying the name would requires some fairly obscure background knowledge, but the teachings should be quite familiar to anybody who would recognize the character.
    ```

      I mean, I think I figured out it with some Wookieepedia searches, but I want to take this moment to engage in an unrelated and likely unproductive rant.

      Your comment represents everything I hate about /r/rational - perhaps it wasn't your intention, but it very strongly reads as a self-aggrandizing and boasting account of your knowledge, while also belittling those who do not have it, while at the same time not actually including the answer to your "riddle". Despite not at all recognizing the character initially, I in theory fall under the froup of "anybody who would recognize the character", due to >!having played KOTOR II!<, and yet I didn't realize that's who that was until after investigating. 

      For posterity, I'm fairly certain the holocron is of >!Kreia, aka Darth Traya, which would make sense given the similar plot at the time in Star Wars Rebels!<

        I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel like I was calling you dumb for not getting a reference.  Perhaps it would have been better for me to say that if you were familiar with the source material, it was far more likely that you would recognize the character's beliefs than that you would recognize her name.

        Having said that, you do need to relax.  You managed to turn a general comment into a personal attack on you, which was not at all the intention of  my comment.  You're being over-sensitive about this.

        And yes, it's Kreia.  Nerra backwards is Arren, and there's a fan-theory that Arren Kae, the mother of the Handmaiden, is in fact Kreia herself.

        EDIT: I wasn't familiar with the Star Wars Rebels plot, though.  Do you happen to know which episode it was?

        EDIT 2: Gosh, I wonder who downvoted me. /s

          u/Sephirothrr's response offers a sharing of information which can be useful. It indicates that your message may be misunderstood by some audiences. We can look at this specific case (like how you explained where the misunderstanding came from). We can also look at the general case, that it may be useful to edge on the safe side when making comments to avoid misunderstandings. 

          On the whole I think you responded respectfully.

  I really like the premise of this LitRPG. Hope he/she keeps going
  ```

- u/GeneralExtension:

  Great story. I've never understood why >!the least element of that set would be interesting!< though. Is The Witcher story as good as A Voice Across The Void?

    Odds are good that you are working under the normal definition of interesting, and not the mathematical one. The mathematical one is basically "I can make a statement about this" because really very few number are interesting to any sane person.

    So, if you started taking all the "patterns" that do not provide full coverage of the number spectrum some numbers get hit more than others, and some will simply be missed. The ones that are missed were considered "Boring numbers". which is just "Numbers that do not show up on any other lists". But, one you make a list of numbers that are not on a list, those numbers are now on a list, which causes a lot of nerds to get excited because it has a "mathematical paradox" in a very niche group.
    ```

    - u/GeneralExtension:
      ```
      That's the best explanation I've heard so far - a number is interesting if it shows up on a list of numbers that follow a pattern. Thanks.
      ```

  - u/sephirothrr:
    ```
    It's different, certainly, and I enjoyed it, but ymmv. It is rather short though, so it wouldn't take much of an investment of time.
    ```
