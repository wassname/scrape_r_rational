  So I suppose this would really be only meaningful with a comparison to the demographics of Reddit.

    So, roughly:

        Age range   Reddit   r/rational

        <18            4%     10%
        18-24         30%     63%
        25-34         25%     23%
        35-44         22%      3%
        45+           20%     <1%

    i.e. far fewer over 35.

      Interesting, though not entirely unexpected. Though I do have to note the different data collection methods almost surely play a part.
      ```

      - u/RMcD94:
        ```
        That's true I'm not sure how the Google Adsense works or if clicking on the ad or blocking it change the data collection because that would be sure to skew to the elderly.

        Regardless I'd expect this slant as transhumanism and fanfiction culture are certainly more youthful phenomenon.

      Sorry what?

  Here's the link to the output of the form, where I inquired about the age of our r/rational redditors. About 500 people responded. **Click the Distribution tab at the bottom for the table and chart reflecting this**. :)
  ```

  - u/DaystarEld:
    ```
    Wow. If ~500 people responded out of ~2050 readers, I was actually still  underestimating how many people on here are lurkers. Especially since most posts cap at around 20-30ish votes.
    ```

- u/gommm:
  ```
  Hmm, now I feel old. I didn't expect to be among the older ~15% at 32 years old...
  ```

- u/Rhamni:
  ```
  But seriously though, how are we coming along on the whole life extension thing?

    IIRC, we've recently discovered a drug that reverses aging in muscle tissue, and it's currently undergoing testing.

    Hopefully in about five years it will be available.

    - u/None:
      ```
      That's a standard troll-comment by /pol/ raiders.  I'm a little mystified at what it's doing here.
      ```

      - u/Seeworthy121:
        ```
        Not surprising, but I haven't noticed any trolls in this sub until now. :/ it was good while it lasted
        ```

      - u/traverseda:
        ```
        I figure there's at least a 20% chance it was /u/eaturbrainz.
        ```

        - u/None:
          ```
          Must I get blamed for *every* time a troll-response shows up in a LW-related survey?

          I mean, I can fully understand what information might lead you to assign that probability (I jew-troll the crap out of the politics/news subreddits sometimes), but my comment is actually #74.
          ```

  ```
  So, it seems I'm in a very small minority here. I'll take that as yet more evidence that I'm still young at heart and in my mind.
  ```

  - u/MoralRelativity:
    ```
    And I enjoyed reading all the random comments too.
