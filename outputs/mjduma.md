  Hmmm.

  U-V is missing.  Does "Valley of the Shadow of Death" have a meaning in Truman's world that it doesn't in ours?

  It's also interesting that Meryl and Marlon, his canonical wife and best friend from the movie, don't make it past eleven in this world.  It makes sense that expecting kids to lie to their "best friend" for years on end might be traumatic for them.

    Yeah, the secrets they keep probably have a bigger impact on them than they even realize

  Making the “good morning, good afternoon, goodnight” line originate from his childhood friend is sweet

    He's starting to break my heart. I had expected this to be funnier before I started writing chapter 1

  damn this is starting to feel downright apocalyptic.  mass climate change and something else outside the dome that is outright scary...world governments collaborating on the truman project makes it a lot more than entertainment like cannon.  some interesting threads to follow

    Thank you for this enormous compliment

  Oooh, I just read the first chapter, and I got chills. But I was smiling. A weird feeling.

  These kids are really cute.  Shame that their friendships were forcibly ended.  

  It's interesting that Marlon gets his own encyclopedia entry.  I'm guessing he becomes something of an advocate against the conditions Truman is put in.
