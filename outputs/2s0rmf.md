  **Warning: Acceptance of a divine spark accompanying the portfolio of Death may have the following side effects:**

  * Phenomenal cosmic power.
  * ~~Itty bitty living space.~~
  * Sudden loss of temper.
  * Uncontrollable murderous rage.
  * Failure to realize the world is now slightly more malleable than cardboard to your hands.
  * Shifting down towards the deep end of the alignment pool.
  * Severe antipathy from much more powerful Gods who may want to squish you.
  * Complete and total loss of morality.
  * Eye-color change.
  * The contempt and possible annihilation of your permanent essence for failing to follow rules set by overdeities.
  * Stomachache.
  * Accidentally murdering your father.
  * Accidentally murdering a peace officer.
  * Accidentally murdering abusive husbands.
  * Y'know what? Let's just put 'accidental murder: general' here.
  * Summoning dark spirits beyond the ken of man whose unchecked feeding could end all life.
  * Chills.
  * Hatred of all that is good and pure.
  * Headache.
  * Gothic aesthetic shifting.
  * Depression.
  * Ennui.
  * Divine vendetta.

  For spontaneously appearing bones lasting longer than 4 hours, please consult the God of Physicians. If you haven't angered them.

  Which you probably have.

    I'm really tempted to make a plethora of sockpuppet accounts so I can upvote this as many times as it deserves...but, I won't.  Only one upvote for you, sorry.

      I occasionally have random attacks of wit. This one I just couldn't hold in.

      Ah, we can just give him gold, how about that?

    Should throw Halitosis on there somewhere.  It's _always_ on the list somewhere.

    B'sides, I'm sure her breath really _does_ smell like death.

  If Shailos is always like that I totally understand why Neklos wanted to have more power.

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    That's pretty much his thing, yeah.  "I'm the biggest and baddest and also the only actual god; the rest of you are just spirits, demons, etc."

    Unfortunately, he's actually strong enough and smart enough to back a lot of that attitude up.
    ```

  This story initially had Albrecht as Big Bad Evil. 

  Then we see that Albrecht is good, and Afi is the problem.

  Then we see that Afi is good, and Neklos is the problem.

  Now we see, that Neklos had to deal with shit like that. 


  Indeed, "Factions are defined and driven into conflict by their beliefs and values, not just by being "good" or "evil"."

    ```
    Previously: Stop the evil invading army from destroying your nation! Stop the evil endless multiplying army of the undead from destroying humanity! Stop the evil lich king from leading the undead! Stop the evil god of death from controlling the lich!

    Now: Stop the evil arrogant one true god from being a huge dick!
    ```

    - u/eaglejarl:
      ```
      Heh. 

      I was targeting something more along the lines of "stop the very sweet young girl who is, oh yes, he goddess of death, from going batshit crazy and massively evil", but I suppose yours works too. :>
      ```

  - u/eaglejarl:
    ```
    I wouldn't say that Afi was good so much as that he wasn't interested in conquering the world any more. When he WAS doing the conqueror thing, he was quite happy to create living, sentient beings for the sole purpose of having their souls ripped out seconds after they came into existence...and that was just Tuesday. There's a reason that the Lich Kings -- some of the most powerful and Evil beings on the planet -- were terrified of him. 

    For that matter, I wouldn't even say that Albrecht is good...he slaughtered every living thing in two entire cities, right down to the dogs and cats, in order to accomplish his goals. It just so happens that his interests are aligned with those of the protagonist. 

    I'm glad you like the faction-not-alignment thing, though. I've put some real effort into that.

  Well, shit's going down. I get the feeling that Suze could just end up as a God of Death similar to Neklos. Seems like all her actions could've been avoided if the Gods had sat her down and said "You can do this, you can't do this, this is how you use your power" etc.
