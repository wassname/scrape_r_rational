  The translator for this series has commented that they're getting tired of translating it, here: http://mangastream.com/r/wsjac/%2322/3795/3

  I don't think the author is enjoying the series as much as we are. If they drop it, I hope we can find someone willing to translate for us. This has seriously been a highlight of my weeks for a couple months now.

  Huh, now we see to be getting an idea of where's Emma's specialty lies in. Empathy, but more than just understanding feelings into being able to predict how a given personality is likely to act in a situation. It's really cool to see her 'out-smart' Ray and Norman in this chapter for once.
