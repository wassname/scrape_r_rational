## Worth the candle recap?

### Post:

Is there any place I can read a summary of the plot up to the current chapter? I just don't have the time to reread the entire thing but I would really like to keep reading the updates.

  ```
  I think there is a wiki being build up, which will feature a summary. Correct me, if I am wrong.
  ```

    ```
    Wiki is [here](http://worththecandle.wikia.com/wiki/Worth_the_Candle_Wiki), still very much under construction
    ```
