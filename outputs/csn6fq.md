  I am quite curious about what happens if those stones or runes are destroyed (or someone tries to destroy them) with brute force.  


  I do not think 'demimonde' means what the author thinks it means...
  ```

  - u/ATRDCI:
    ```
    I'd argue it both does and doesn't.  In French (which is EE's first language) it literally means "half-world" which fits fine enough in the context it is in.

    &nbsp; 

    It was nice to see Akua interact with the *provincial* wielder of the Half-Hornet. Seems her opinion of him hasn't changed mucb

      ```
      I see!  Thank you!
      ```

- u/IllusoryIntelligence:
  ```
  I’m not sure where it is going but with the reveal of Masego’s third aspect we have three power thieves on the scene now. That’s one Dead King aspect each.
  ```

  - u/RidesThe7:
    ```
    We know that the Dead King was a villain before his ascension (I think), but do we have any confirmation that he still is?
    ```

    - u/leakycauldron:
      ```
      Are you wondering if the Dead King is a villain? He's a God, bound to service of Below. He's an existential threat. He farms humans. I don't think the Cherabim whisper in his ear.
      ```

      - u/RidesThe7:
        ```
        I’m wondering if he’s Named.
        ```

        - u/leakycauldron:
          ```
          Gotcha, sorry. Friends and I use villain/Villain terminology and it leaked.
          ```

      - u/Noir_Bass:
        ```
        Yeah I think he means if he still has 3 aspects like regular Named, or even a Name at all, after his apotheosis.
        ```

- u/Nic_Cage_DM:
  ```
  Well I guess we know how Masego is going to get his Gift back
  ```

- u/AStartlingStatement:
  ```
  Good stuff.
  ```

  - u/thunder_crane:
    ```
    ....I'm stuff
    ```

    - u/AStartlingStatement:
      ```
      For you.
      ```

- u/vimefer:
  ```
  Gods beware, Zeze can YOINK your miracles now !
  ```

- u/BlackKnightG93M:
  ```
  Huh wonder how the fight between Neshamah and Masego would have played out if he had **wrest** then...
  ```

  - u/Nimelennar:
    ```
    Yoink!  And then the **Wrest** is history.
    ```

  - u/Zayits:
    ```
    I think he already had it by then, it was just that he couldn’t *Wrest* away something that already belonged to him, used it up for an earlier working or simply was too tired:

    > And so he had ruined the realm, and from ruin gained mastery – aspect pulsing, breathing, pulsing. It was… unpleasant. His body ached, and so he had withdrawn from it
    ```

    - u/BlackKnightG93M:
      ```
      That paragraph could easily describe **ruin**.
      ```
