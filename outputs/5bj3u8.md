  > "OKAY, THAT'S IT," Aaron yells, "EVERYBODY _HALT_."

  > Sarah looks at him. Sohu looks at him. Half-finished incantations hang in the air, unmoving.

  > "Look. Sarah. You've looked at the Internet, right, before you got here? Read our stories? Any fairy tales? Young adult fiction?"

  > Sarah looks puzzled. "I don't see the relevance," she says, frowning. Sohu's eyes widen - she sees where this is going.

  > "Stories are vital!" Aaron yells, because this is _important_. "They remind us how to be human! Look, you're smart, you get how patterns work. Complete the sentence. A young girl cries that without the magical thing that makes her special nobody will love her, and the hero looks at her and says-"

  > A moment of silence. Sarah blinks once. "I have been a bit foolish, haven't I."

  > The hanging storm of unformed power dissipates.

  Because it really should be obvious. Especially in a universe that literally runs on narrative law. _Especially_ if you're a computer _made_ for finding patterns.

    Aaron hasn't really been shown as being particularly good at thinking on his feet.

  Well, I guess this answers [that](https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/comments/55j18c/unsong_chapter_40_in_terrible_majesty/d8b8qp8/).

  Very interested in seeing just how powerful Sohu has become. And Sarah needs some serious psychological help.

            So faster person, that works too.

  They couldn't network Sarah into the bigger machine? Or would ensouling a computer not allow it's consciousness to spread outside of it's original components, so to speak?
  ```

  - u/Escapement:
    ```
    Yeah, they should try to do a hardware upgrade on the marginally friendly AI, rather than ensouling the thing with nuclear weapons.

      I don't think Sarah is quite clear thinking enough to want that right now. Definitely a good plan, but as her chapter told us, she's not in a good headspace.

  That punchline.

  ```
  I wish these chapters were longer, getting plot in these bite size chunks is driving me nuts.
  ```

  - u/None:
    ```
    That's the nature of serialized fiction. You could always wait until a book is finished before reading a big chunk.

  >“Yes,” said Sohu, and snapped her fingers.

  Nice shout-out to HPMOR, which makes me wonder how much prep work Sohu had to do in the background before snapping her fingers.
  ```

- u/Frommerman:
  ```
  So. Interesting thing here.

  There is only one character we've ever seen talking in all caps in this series, and that's obviously Uriel. And now Sarah.

  How powerful is Sarah? How powerful is Sohu?
  ```

  - u/SvalbardCaretaker:
    ```
    Nah, Sarah is just doing good ol' ordinary shouting.
    ```

    - u/Frommerman:
      ```
      Really? You're taking a notable stylistic difference in Unsong of all things as a mere coincidence?

      This isn't a coincidence because nothing is a coincidence.

      - u/saitselkis:
        ```
        Strong enough that uriel's young (even factoring in her immortality, shes probably around Aaron's age) protégé can literally snap her strings on the instant without using mundane kaballa. Sarah may be the most horrifying collection of names, ability to speak them flawlessly in fractions of a second and a dangerous mental instability, but she's still on level 1 of the kaballa ladder. Sohu accidentally started messing with 4 just to prove she could. Sarah is nothing to Uriel, bot in terms of power and his professed meanglessness of having a soul. To him, shes a computer with an ego and some misgotten divine light. To Sohu, shes a loud but minor annoyance.

    I don't know why but I always read Uriel stuff as small caps like Death from Discworld.
